<p>According to a report in US Weekly, the <a href="/categories/basketball-wives/">Basketball Wives</a> star and her baseball fiance have decided to go their separate ways and their engagement has been called off. </p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-call-off-engagement-w497158">They did break up but it was over infidelity back in February</a>,” a rep for the Basketball Wives star, 41, confirmed to Us in a statement on Thursday, August 10.</p>
<p>“Right now they are focused on being responsible and loving parents to their 3-year-old kid.” The pair “do remain friends,” but Lozada is living apart from Crawford. </p>
<p>The pair got engaged back in December 2013 after Crawford asked Lozada to be his wife with a $1.5 million ring. </p>

<p>All seemed to be going well for them, and they welcomed their first child together, Leo, in 2014. </p>
<p>While infidelity is cited as the reason for the breakup, the report does not confirm whether it was Lozada or Crawford who was unfaithful. </p>
<p>Chances are, we will get more clarity on VH1&#8217;s Basketball Wives, which is where you can currently watch Evelyn on a weekly basis. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The breakup rumors went into overdrive when the pair failed to address each other on social media and seemed to be doing their own thing. </p>
<p>Maybe VH1 wanted them to keep quiet about the breakup to create some drama and shock viewers whenever it is revealed on the reality series. </p>
<p>Sometimes, however, living a lie is not the best thing to do, and it appears that Evelyn was tired of the multitude of questions surrounding her personal life. </p>
<p>With the news finally being revealed, fans took to social media to support Evelyn, with one saying, “Whether or not the tea that’s out there is true prayers with @Evelyn Lozada.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Evelyn responded to the kind words with love hearts and the praying emoji. In any case, it sounds like Evelyn is ready to draw a line under this chapter of her life. </p>
<p>The relationship was likely on thin ice after the revelation that the couple tried to conceive another child and it resulted in several miscarriages. </p>
<p>&#8220;I had three miscarriages in the last year and a half. So, fast forward, you don&#8217;t really realize how quickly your body changes,&#8221; Evelyn confirmed during a guest stint on The Real last year. </p>
<p>Over to you. </p>
<p>What do you think about all of this?</p>

<p>Prepare to see some fresh faces when this popular reality series returns in 2017. Much to the chagrin of Nick Young and Dwayne Wade.</p>
<p>Allow us to explain&#8230;.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="917" height="874" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives.png" alt="Three Basketball Wives" class="wp-image-248863" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives.png 917w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-300x286.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-768x732.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-735x701.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-335x319.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-347x331.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-520x496.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/three-basketball-wives-640x610.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(VH1)</figcaption></figure>

<p>According to TMZ, producers are looking to crank up the drama on the program and have therefore agreed to deals with&nbsp;Keonna Green and Aja Metoyer.</p>
<p>Who are&nbsp;Keonna Green and Aja Metoyer?</p>
<p>The former is now the two-time father of Nick Young&#8217;s kids.</p>
<p>She slept with Young while he was still dating Iggy&nbsp;Azaela, got knocked up during this affair <a href="/2016/10/keonna-green-gives-birth-to-nick-youngs-baby/">and gave birth</a> to the occasional couple&#8217;s latest child in late October.</p>
<p>In July, <a href="/2016/07/keonna-green-im-glad-i-got-knocked-up-by-nick-young/">Green explained how she and Young</a> got caught up in various moments while caring for their first kid together then &quot;it just happened.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><em>It</em></strong>, in this case, being the unprotected sex that produced a pregnancy.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&rsquo;t feel guilty because I was in love with a man, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m not the only woman,&quot; Green said this summer about whether she regretted her role in Young and Azaela&#8217;s break-up.</p>
<p>That did end up being the case, as it was later revealed that Young cheated on Azaela with numerous women.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Then there&#8217;s <a href="/2014/01/dwyane-wade-cheating-on-gabrielle-union-with-aja-metoyer/">Aja&nbsp;Metoyer</a>.</p>
<p>She slept with Wade while he was famously on a break from Gabrielle Union and also got pregnant in the process, giving birth three years ago to a very young man Xavier.</p>
<p>Union has said that Wade made her aware of this development prior to the famous couple getting back together and she has since welcomed Xavier into her life with open arms.</p>
<p>Oh, and&nbsp;Metoyer is also the mother of a child she had with actor Damon Wayans Jr.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Green and Metoyer will join Shaunie O&#8217;Neal (who also serves as a producer on the series), Tami Roman and Jackie Christie as main cast members on Season 6 of Basketball Wives.</p>
<p>But they aren&#8217;t the only new additions:</p>
<p>Evelyn Lozada is returning to the series!</p>
<p>A former Basketball Wife,&nbsp;Lozada &#8211; who you can see as a guest host on The Real next week &#8211; has been engaged to both Antoine Walker&hellip; married and then divorced from Chad Johnson&hellip; and then engaged to Carl Crawford.</p>

<p>VH1 is yet to announce a premiere date for Basketball Wives Season 6.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that very few of the women who appear on this show are actually wives of any kind.</p>
<p>But whatever, right? As long as they yell and scream and fight a lot&#8230;</p>

The Basketball Wives star and the L.A. Dodgers outfielder welcomed a son on Saturday!</p>
<p>Born at 3:55 a.m., the new addition weighed in at 8 lbs. and measured 21 inches long. Crawford by her side, Lozada delivered naturally in just four pushes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/evelyn-lozada-welcomes-first-child-with-carl-crawford"></a></figure>
<p>&ldquo;It was very quick and she is happy because she was super nervous,&rdquo; Lozada&#8217;s rep said. &ldquo;Baby boy is so handsome and she can&rsquo;t wait to reveal him to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a Tweet posted Saturday afternoon, <a href="/stars/evelyn-lozada/">Evelyn Lozada</a> wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have <a href="http://celebritybabies.people.com/2014/03/22/evelyn-lozada-carl-crawford-welcome-son/">EXCITING NEWS</a>! Thank you God for my blessing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first child for Crawford and Lozada, but her second overall, joining big sister Shaniece, 20, her daughter from a previous relationship.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about being a mommy all over again. This is something I&rsquo;ve been wanting for years and I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s finally happening,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Although the mom-to-be initially kept the identity of the baby&rsquo;s father a secret, <a href="/2013/12/evelyn-lozada-engaged-to-carl-crawford/">she and Carl Crawford got engaged</a> over the holidays last winter.</p>
<p>She was previously married to Chad Johnson, until he head-butted her in an argument purportedly over his cheating just weeks after they married.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping for better from Carl. Congrats to the couple!</p>

<p>The couple is engaged!</p>
<p>Lozada, best known for starring on <em>Basketball Wives</em> and for her roller coaster relationship with former NFL star Chad Johnson, made the announcement on Instagram today, posting a photo of her engagement ring along with one simple word:</p>
<p><strong>YES!</strong></p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          

<p>Earlier this month, Crawford was identified <a href="/2013/12/carl-crawford-evelyn-lozada-baby-daddy-revealed/">as Lozada&#8217;s baby daddy</a>.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m overjoyed and in complete and utter shock!&#8221; <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20769836,00.html">Lozada tells People</a>. &#8220;What a different year and a half it has been – I&#8217;m truly happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And who wouldn&#8217;t be with an engagement ring that looks like this? The thing is comprised of 14.5 total carats!</p>

<p>According to Evelyn&#8217;s rep, the proposal took place on Christmas Day and also took Lozada by total surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;HappiestGirlInTheWorld,&#8221; the bride-to-be wrote alongside with another photo of the ring.</p>
<p>We send the engaged duo our very best wishes. They join <a href="/2013/12/dwyane-wade-and-gabrielle-union-engaged/">Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union</a> as a sports-based couple that is newly betrothed.</p>

Now the reality star has at last revealed the baby&#8217;s father.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Carl Crawford!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/evelyn-lozada-pregnant-by-carl-crawford"></a></figure>
<p>The Basketball Wives star, 37, who confirmed her second pregnancy via Twitter in late November, had kept the identity of the baby&#8217;s father under wraps.</p>
<p>Now she has confirmed to OMG! Insider&#8217;s Nina Parker in an interview airing Monday that the rumors circulating about Crawford are indeed true.</p>
<p>The L.A. Dodgers outfielder, 32, nicknamed &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; by fans and one of the most overpaid men in sports, is certainly a great catch!</p>
<p>Or was. It&#8217;s not clear if they&#8217;re still together. But if you&#8217;re going for a sports baby daddy to take care of you for 18 years, Evelyn Lozada hit the jackpot.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Lozada also went on to reveal that she was in love with Crawford &#8211; &quot;I still believe in love,&quot; she said &#8211; despite her tumultuous relationship history.</p>
<p>Evelyn was famously married to NFL star Chad &quot;Ochocinco&quot; Johnson for six weeks in 2012, until <a href="/2012/08/chad-johnson-arrested-for-domestic-violence-accused-of-head-butt/">Chad head-butted her</a> and got arrested during a fight.</p>
<p>Lozada sort of implies that she and Crawford still have a thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I definitely would get married again,&quot; she said in the interview. &quot;I&#8217;m not one of those people that&#8217;s like &lsquo;we need to get engaged, we need to get married.&rsquo;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, absolutely not &#8230; I feel likeif that&#8217;s going to come, just like with the baby, let it come. I&#8217;m not forcing anything, so if it happens, it happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The VH1 reality star, who has a 20-year-old daughter named Shaniece from a previous relationship, also revealed her due date is in late March.</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p>Lozada and Johnson had a rocky, well-publicized relationship that came to an end in August 2012 after the ex-wide receiver was accused of <a href="/2013/06/evelyn-lozada-bloody-head-photo-released-chad-johnson-out-of-jai/">head-butting Evelyn</a>.</p>
