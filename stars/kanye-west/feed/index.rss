<p>As we&#8217;re guessing you&#8217;ve heard by now, Kanye West has been off his rocker for awhile.</p>



<p>The rapper has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">declared himself to be a Nazi</a> and has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-im-a-billionaire-and-i-have-total-control-over-my-wife/">said he controls his wife</a> and basically issued one far right, nonsensical and insane statement after another for the last couple years.</p>



<p>West hasn&#8217;t really said anything about ex-spouse Kim Kardashian, however.</p>



<p>Until now.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1024x682.jpg" alt="Recording artist Kanye West and TV personality Kim Kardashian attend the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honoring Barbara Kruger and Quentin Tarantino presented by Gucci at LACMA on November 1, 2014 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-511591" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian attend the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honoring Barbara Kruger and Quentin Tarantino presented by Gucci at LACMA on November 1, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for LACMA)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On March 15, the troubled artist ranted and raved on social media over theownership of any trademarks related to the pair&#8217;s daughter North West’s name.</p>



<p>West did so amid a series of posts to Twitter&#8230; one of which included a new song featuring Diddy, Diddy’s son Christian “King” Combs and West’s oldest child with Kardashian.</p>



<p>Kanye shared the track, titled “LONELY ROADS STILL GO TO SUNSHINE,” directly to the social media account, even though &#8212; as TMZ writes &#8212; Kardashian tried to get a judge to <em>stop</em> this release from ever taking place.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to blame the reality star, considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/">Diddy has been arrested for sex trafficking</a> and other truly awful charges.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim and Kanye throwback" class="wp-image-503068" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party following the 92nd Oscars at The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills on February 9, 2020. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jean-Baptiste Lacroix / AFP) (Photo by JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to TMZ insiders, Kardashian sent out legal notices “demanding a cease &amp; desist” in regard to this single and had an “emergency hearing with a mediator and a judge,” which prompted West to promise he would not make the song public.</p>



<p>So it sounds as if he lied.</p>



<p>Just before uploading the track on Saturday, meanwhile, the rapper put up screenshots of alleged text conversations he claims to have had with Kardashian&#8230; as the exes go back and forth regarding the trademark of North’s name.</p>



<p>At one point in this exchange, West tells Kardashian “I’m never speaking with you again,&#8221; to which Kim replies: </p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-516509" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kim continued writing that the former spouses agreed when their kids were born that Kardashian would get their children’s names and trademarks “so no one else would take them.” </p>



<p>West didn&#8217;t counter this point, but allegedly replied: </p>



<p>“Amend it or I’m going to war And neither of us will recover from the public fallout You’re going to have to kill me.”</p>



<p>Kanye then asked his followers for their opinion on all of this ugliness.</p>



<p>For her part, Kim has not responded in public to the spat, but she previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kim-kardashian-breaks-divorce-silence-kanye-is-a-changed-and-awful-man/">said on an episode of The Kardashians</a> that West was &#8220;not the same person&#8221; she married and added of their divorce:</p>



<p>“It’s [tough] when you don’t want your marriage to end off of personal reasons but circumstances change that force your marriage to end.</p>



<p>“When you weren’t planning on that and that’s not really the outcome you want but there’s no other option, I think it makes it harder to get over.”</p>

<p>As previously reported, Kanye West demanded <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">freedom for Diddy this week and also declared himself</a> to be a Nazi.</p>



<p>And yet, somehow&#8230; these have proven to be the rapper&#8217;s <em>least</em> controversial statements of late.</p>



<p>According to some, that is, who have read West&#8217;s Tweets in regard to wife Bianca Censori and her recent appearance on the Grammy Awards red carpet.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518785" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197300297-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West and Bianca Censori attend the 67th GRAMMY Awards on February 2, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-divorce-rapper-to-split-from-bianca-censori-any-second-now/">Censori donned a totally see-through dress</a> at the aforementioned event. She was basically naked. For real.</p>



<p>Based on video footage from the ceremony, one could tell that Censori was uncomfortable baring it all for photographers &#8230; as West towered over his embarrassed spouse.</p>



<p>It was all very awkward.</p>



<p>To the critics, however, Kanye is making no apologies. He&#8217;s doubling down instead, while outing himself as a total and complete sexist.</p>

<p>“I have dominion over my wife,” the 47-year old wrote in all-caps via X on Friday, February 7. </p>



<p>“This ain’t no woke as feminist sh-t. She’s with a billionaire. Why would she listen to any of you dumb ass broke bitches. People say the red carpet look was her decision. Yes, I don’t make her do nothing she doesn’t want to.”</p>



<p>It sort of sounds as if that&#8217;s <em>exactly</em> what West has been doing with Censori.</p>



<p>“She definitely wouldn’t have been able to do it without my approval, you stupid ass woke pawns,” West continued on Friday of his wife&#8217;s stunning appearance. </p>

<p>West was up for Best Rap Song at Sunday’s award show, although he and Censori did not stay for the ceremony. </p>



<p>There was chatter at the time that they got kicked out, although sources have alleged since that the couple left of their own accord.</p>



<p>“Ask me how it was to beat the Grammys. We beat the Grammys,” West told TMZ on February 4, seemingly proud of himself for grabbing the spotlight despite losing out to Kendrick Lamar in the aforementioned category.</p>



<p>Two days later, West praised Censori’s red carpet debut.</p>

<p>“My wife’s first red carpet opened a whole new world,” the artist wrote via X. </p>



<p>“I keep staring at this photo like I was staring in admiration that night Thinking wow I am so lucky to have a wife that is so smart talented brave and hot … She took a break from shooting her first film to make a movie in real life.”</p>



<p>West began dating Censori in early 2023, a number of months after he finalized his divorce from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>. </p>



<p>West and Censori later held a “small marriage ceremony” that same year.</p>

<p>For months now, we&#8217;ve been hearing rumors that Kanye West is headed for a divorce.</p>



<p>But if the couple&#8217;s appearance at tonight&#8217;s Grammy Awards is any indication, it seems that they&#8217;re still going strong!</p>



<p>Yes, Bianca was almost completely nude as she posed next to &#8216;Ye on the red carpet.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West and Australian model Bianca Censori arrive for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on February 2, 2025." class="wp-image-518312" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802356-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West and Australian model Bianca Censori arrive for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on February 2, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP) / RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The pics are surprising for a number of reasons.</p>



<p>For one thing, Bianca was almost completely nude on the red carpet! And that&#8217;s never something that one expects to see at an award show.</p>



<p>The Aussie model dropped her full-length fur coat to reveal a completely transparent dress that left very little to the imagination.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2196802162-1024x683.jpg" alt="US rapper and producer Kanye West and Australian model Bianca Censori arrive for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on February 2, 2025.

<p>On top of that, the appearance comes on the heels of months of divorce rumors.</p>



<p>According to TMZ, the rapper and wife Bianca Censori have been &#8220;telling people around them they split up a few weeks ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>At one point, the marriage appeared to be over &#8212; just without any official paperwork having been filed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="918" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-1024x918.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510763" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-1024x918.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-300x269.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-768x689.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-2048x1836.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-960x861.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-1080x968.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2033233228-1200x1076.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West and Bianca Censori attend the Marni Fall/Winter 2024 Fashion Show during the Milan Fashion Week &#8211; Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025 on February 23, 2024 in Milan, Italy. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Alessandro Levati/Getty Images for Marni Srl)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This same celebrity gossip outlet claims that Censori has been spending most of her time in Australia with her family.</p>



<p>And also that West is planning to move to Tokyo (<em>good riddance, buddy!</em>) and formally divorce his spouse pretty much any day now.</p>



<p>The controversial artist has been spotted in Japan on multiple occasions of late without Censori. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/07/kanye-west-bianca-censori-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> has been reporting on this impending divorce since October.</p>

<p>But last month, in a shocking twist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ye/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye shared photos of himself posing alongside Bianca</a> in his Instagram Story.</p>



<p>The move was clearly intended to send a message, as Kanye has very rarely shared photos of his wife over the course of their marriage.</p>



<p>Kanye and Censori got married in December 2022, just one month after the Chicago native finalized his divorce from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>. </p>



<p>After exchanging these vows, Bianca was often seen spending time with Ye and his four kids &#8212; North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm &#8212; while also making headlines for her daring and revealing fashion choices that often made it look like she was naked.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-1024x695.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510765" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-1080x733.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1405334206-1200x815.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West onstage during the 2022 BET Awards at Microsoft Theater on June 26, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>An insider previously told <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/inside-kanye-wests-twisted-rules-for-bianca-censori-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch Weekly</a></em> that Kanye “exerts total control” over his wife&#8217;s life, implementing “a set of rules” that includes him as the mastermind behind the extremely skimpy looks.</p>



<p>This would be gross, albeit not surprising, if true.</p>



<p>Said this tabloid source in a bit more alleged detail:</p>



<p>“It’s obvious to everyone that he’s picking out her clothes, but it’s a lot more twisted than that. Before they leave the house, Ye chooses her outfit and then makes her parade around for the camera so he can videotape her from every angle.”</p>



<p>Again: Gross if true.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also been rumored that West “screens her social media” and decides what “she can and can’t watch or read,” with the source adding that Ye says he’s “doing it for her own benefit.”</p>

<p>West, who has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/kanye-west-sued-assistant/">sued for sexual harassment</a> by a former assistant, even &#8220;controls what [Censori] eats and drinks,&#8221; this report concludes.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain whether any of this chatter is valid or not.</p>



<p>And yet we still feel confident in saying the following:</p>



<p>Get out of there as soon as you can, Bianca. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>So much for those rumors of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kanye-west-broke-begging-kim-kardashian-for-money/">Kanye West being broke</a>.</p>



<p>If Kanye West himself is to be believed, that is.</p>



<p>A simple (and sort of random) Instagram post shared by the artist on January 24 reads as follows:</p>



<p><strong>In 2025, Ye’s net worth stands at $2.77 billion USD as confirmed by Eton Ventures Services. The valuation is based on his music portfolio and his sole ownership of the Yeezy mark.</strong></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="983" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-1024x983.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517768" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-1024x983.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-300x288.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-768x737.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-2048x1966.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-960x921.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-1080x1037.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1433019483-1200x1152.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the &#8220;The Greatest Lie Ever Sold&#8221; Premiere Screening on October 12, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images for DailyWire+)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The 47-year-old captioned the graphic by writing, “LAA LA LA LA.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll leave readers to believe what they see fit based on this upload, but Forbes previously declared Kanye was no longer a billionaire after his partnership with Adidas was canceled in the wake of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/adidas-finally-cut-ties-with-kanye-west-in-wake-of-anti-semitic-hate-filled-remarks/">West basically coming out as a Nazi</a> in October 2022.</p>



<p>At the time, it was reported that the loss of this deal lowered the rapper&#8217;s net work to $400 million, which included earnings from real estate, cash, his music catalog and a five percent stake in ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s Skims.</p>



<p>For the record:</p>



<p>Forbes <em>still</em> lists Kanye’s net worth as $400 million, but the new evaluation from Eton Venture Services­ &#8212; which says it “provides audit-defensible business valuations across the entire business lifecycle” on its website &#8211;would mean he’s surpassed the net worth almost every other celebrity in Hollywood.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kanye West on March 11, 2022." class="wp-image-517589" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_kanyewest_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rapper Kanye West and girlfriend Chaney Jones attend a game between the Washington Wizards and the Los Angeles Lakers in the fourth quarter at Crypto.com Arena on March 11, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, IF this report is true, it would mean that West and Jay-Z (valued at $2.5 billion) are the only rappers at this point to be considered billionaires.</p>



<p>Forbes lists Jay-Z’s net worth at the number above, while claiming the net worth of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> is $1.7 billion; while Taylor Swift sits at at $1.1 billion.</p>



<p>Stars who fall just below this status include Tyler Perry and LeBron James.</p>



<p>The semi-deranged music mogul did confess last year that the end of his partnership with Adidas plunged him into severe financial hardship. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kanye West on July 1, 2024." class="wp-image-512369" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1031_kanyewest_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Anonymous Club fashion show during Berlin Fashion Week SS25 at Tempodrom on July 1, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matthias Nareyek/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>West told TMZ in 2024: </p>



<p>“I’m gonna be honest with y’all: I was two months from going bankrupt, really… And we survived. We survived through the cancellation.</p>



<p>If Kanye really is worth $2.77 billion these days?</p>



<p>That would be quite the understatement.</p>

<p>Honestly, we don&#8217;t know what to make of Kanye West anymore. What exactly are his priorities?! </p>



<p>That&#8217;s the claim being made by an insider who alleges that the rapper&#8217;s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, is &#8220;basically a single mom now.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kanye-west-broke-begging-kim-kardashian-for-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye and Kim&#8217;s marriage ended</a> on somewhat contentious terms. But the claim that Kanye is now an absentee father still comes as a shock to fans.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the Anonymous Club fashion show during Berlin Fashion Week SS25 at Tempodrom on July 1, 2024 in Berlin, Germany." class="wp-image-511588" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159619959-1-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Anonymous Club fashion show during Berlin Fashion Week SS25 at Tempodrom on July 1, 2024 in Berlin, Germany.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matthias Nareyek/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-accused-of-abandoning-his-kids">Kanye West Accused of Abandoning His Kids</h2>



<p>The source in this situation does not claim that Kanye has completely cut ties with his family completely.</p>



<p>They insist, however, that the controversial musician and fashion mogul is &#8220;sadly not around very much.”</p>



<p>The insider acknowledges that Kim has more help than most single moms — but it&#8217;s worth noting that she also faces challenges that are unique to her situation.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1024x682.jpg" alt="Recording artist Kanye West and TV personality Kim Kardashian attend the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honoring Barbara Kruger and Quentin Tarantino presented by Gucci at LACMA on November 1, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>“Although she has help, it’s still a lot of work for her to balance and coordinate everything,” the insider tells <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/21/parents/kim-kardashian-a-single-mom-to-her-kids-kanye-west-not-around-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-attempt-at-civil-co-parenting">An Attempt at Civil Co-Parenting</h2>



<p>According to the terms of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kim-kardashian-wouldnt-take-back-bad-times-with-kanye-i-just-remember-him-before-he-liked-hitler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim and Kanye&#8217;s divorce</a>, the exes share joint custody with “equal access” to their brood.</p>



<p>Kanye reportedly pays $200,000 a month in child support and covers 50 percent of the kids’ educational and security expenses.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-1024x681.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West attend The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-511590" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1147427757-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West attend The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The couple also agreed to rely on mediation in the event of any disputes regarding their children. It seems that Kim has not yet deployed that option.</p>



<p>After welcoming four kids together, Kim and Kanye were declared legally single in 2022.</p>



<p>She began <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kim-kardashian-tattoo-reveal-i-secretly-got-this-after-kissing-pete-davidson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating Pete Davidson</a> shortly thereafter. The relationship didn&#8217;t last. And while Kim has been romantically linked to other famous men, she has not officially dated anyone else.</p>

<p>As for Kanye, he moved on rather quickly, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/kanye-west-marries-bianca-censori-yeezy-employee-who-resembles-his-ex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marrying Bianca Censori </a>less than a year after finalizing his divorce from Kim.</p>



<p>The relationship has been shrouded in secrecy from the start, and now, it looks as though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kanye-west-divorce-rapper-to-split-from-bianca-censori-any-second-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye and Bianca have already called it quits</a>.</p>



<p>The break has not been a clean one, with insiders alleging that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kanye-west-to-wife-i-wanna-f-ck-your-mom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye wanted to have sex with Bianca&#8217;s mom</a> while Bianca watched.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it might not be such a bad thing that Kanye has distanced himself from his kids.</p>



<p>The 47-year-old has long been open about his mental health issues. And it sounds as though he might be experiencing some sort of episode.</p>



<p>We just hope that he&#8217;ll eventually receive whatever sort of help he needs and that his kids will get their dad back.</p>

<p>As it turns out, we were wrong:</p>



<p>Kanye West <em>can</em> still surprise us.</p>



<p>The rapper, who was named Antisemite of the Year in 2023 for all the crazy stuff he said about Jewish people, reportedly wants to have sex with his mother-in-law.</p>



<p>And allegedly told his wife all about it.</p>

<p>In legal documents filed by the rapper’s former assistant &#8212; who worked with him for about a year and a half between 2021 and 2022 &#8212; on October 8, Lauren Pisciotta says that she was shown text messages sent from West to Bianca Censori&#8230; in which he tells her she wants to have intercourse with her mother, Alexandra Censori.</p>



<p>Pisciotta previously sued West for sexual harassment and wrongful termination.</p>



<p>This filing states that Kanye had “proudly” sent Pisciotta a screenshot of an exchange between himself and Censori that took place in September 2022.</p>



<p>“I wanna f-ck your mom,” West’s text to Censori reads, prior to Kanye amending his message and adding:</p>



<p>“Should I ad [sic], I meant I want you to watch me f&#8211;k your mom.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510986" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1433019483-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the &#8220;The Greatest Lie Ever Sold&#8221; Premiere Screening on October 12, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images for DailyWire+)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For the record, West and Censori got married in December 2022, but may get divorced any minute now.</p>



<p>Pisciotta, meanwhile, said that her ex-boss also shared Censori’s reply to the whole mother-banging thing as she supposedly told her spouse that <em>she</em> was gonna sleep with someone else that weekend and said simply of her mom: </p>



<p>“She’s married.”</p>



<p>Sounds like a totally normal and healthy relationship these two have going on here.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this amended complaint, Pisciotta &#8212; who worked for West from 2021 to 2022 &#8212; says that the artist drugged and sexually assaulted her during a studio session co-hosted by Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs. </p>



<p>(Diddy, who is facing separate sex trafficking and racketeering charges, is named in Pisciotta’s complaint, but is <em>not</em> accused of wrongdoing in her case.)</p>



<p>Also: Pisciotta says she learned from an A-List celebrity that West had been “offering her up” as a “gift” to be “sexually violated and assaulted against her will by various men.”</p>



<p>We really have no idea what to believe at this point.</p>

<p>When approached by the Daily Mail October 14 regarding the lawsuit, Censori’s mother asked for privacy and said she “wouldn’t be drawn into the latest claims” about West.</p>



<p>Pisciotta’s lawsuit alleges that West sent vulgar texts, including graphic sexual fantasies, as well as intimate photos of other male and female Yeezy employees.</p>



<p>“See my problem is I be wanting to f-ck but then after I f-ck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f<em>ed while I’m f</em>ing them. Then I want her to cheat on me,” one of the purported messages read, according to Page Six.</p>



<p>She is suing for sexual harassment, breach of contract, wrongful termination and creating a hostile work environment, seeking at least $4 million in damages.</p>

<p>Now, Taylor is celebrating her victory over her longtime rival in subtle but glorious fashion.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a Swiftie, then you know that Taylor loves to hide lyrical Easter eggs for her fans to find. And this one is a two-parter in which Taylor used a single song title to throw shade at a couple of her biggest haters.</p>

<p>The capitalized letters spell out &#8220;Kim,&#8221; presumably in reference to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kim-kardashian-travis-kelce-feud-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s feud with Kim Kardashian</a>.</p>



<p>Kim, of course, supported Kanye when he used the song &#8220;Famous&#8221; to bully and demean Taylor.</p>



<p>This week, Taylor released a new version of the song, recorded at her June 22 concert (and, appropriately, mashed up with her 2011 track &#8220;Mean&#8221;).</p>



<p>This time around, the song is titled &#8220;Thank You, aimEe,&#8221; with the capitalization spelling out &#8220;Ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>“We love a shady queen,&#8221; wrote one person said on X (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>”Taylor changing the letters in thank you aimee from ‘Kim’ to ‘Ye’ is a VERY rep coded thing for her to do,&#8221; another chimed in, adding a snake emoji for good measure.</p>

<p>Taylor, of course, frequently uses her lyrics to express her heartbreak or anger amid breakups or feuds. Her candor is one of the things that fans most love about her.</p>



<p>&#8220;thank You AimEe&#8221; is one of her angriest songs to date. And this week&#8217;s title change serves as further confirmation of the circumstances that inspired her to write it.</p>



<p>“All that time you were throwing punches, I was building something,&#8221; Taylor sings.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I can’t forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed ‘F&#8212; you, Aimee’ to the night sky, as the blood was gushing / But I can’t forget the way you made me heal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, Taylor is clearly no fan of Kanye&#8217;s.</p>



<p>And with her latest triumph on the charts, she may have just scored the decisive victory in their feud.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift just one-upped Kanye West in a way that&#8217;s sure to sting his infamously over-inflated ego.</p>



<p>For years, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/travis-kelces-dad-slams-kanye-west-over-taylor-swift-based-song-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s lyrics have taken shots at Taylor</a>. So did one of his creepiest music videos.</p>



<p>They say that success is the best revenge. If so, Taylor is clearly on the right track.</p>



<p>Taylor didn&#8217;t have to take action to dethrone Ye. Kanye is, as always, his own worst enemy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-just-broke-a-long-running-streak">Kanye West just broke a long-running streak</h2>



<p>Until very recently, Kanye West was enjoying a streak of albums that each went No. 1.</p>



<p>For whatever reason, people keep listening to Ye&#8217;s music. However, things have dropped off lately. One has to wonder if <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kanye-west-praises-hitler-actually-says-out-loud-nazis-arent-so-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s Hitler era</a> could be a factor.</p>



<p>The latest Kanye West album is <em>Vultures 2</em>. It did not hit the No. 1 spot &#8230; breaking his previous 11-album streak. <em>Womp womp</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kanye West on July 1, 2024." class="wp-image-506893" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Anonymous Club fashion show during Berlin Fashion Week SS25 at Tempodrom on July 1, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matthias Nareyek/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Kanye West experiences this <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kanye-west-hits-new-low-jewish-people-you-need-to-forgive-hitler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-deserved</a> setback, Taylor Swift is on top of the world.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t just mean the fact that she recently attained <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-net-worth-billionaire-status-forbes-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaire status</a>. Or the fact that her Eras World Tour is a smashing success.</p>



<p>Taylor&#8217;s most recent album, <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, is in the No. 1 spot. It is the reason why Kanye&#8217;s album broke his streak of somewhat inexplicable successes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-has-plagued-taylor-swift-for-years">Kanye has plagued Taylor Swift for years</h2>



<p>In 2009, Kanye West infamously barged onto the stage at the VMAs, stealing her moment when she was a much younger star. His brazen clownery trended on Twitter at the time, which was a very new phenomenon in 2009.</p>



<p>Since then, Ye has continued to be deeply weird about Taylor and her success.</p>



<p>His lyrics claimed that he had &#8220;made that bitch famous.&#8221; Relatedly, Ye&#8217;s then-wife Kim Kardashian covertly recorded Taylor and then shared a conspicuously edited version of the call to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/taylor-swift-blasts-kim-kardashian-she-teamed-up-with-kanye-to-ruin-my-reputation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempt to take down Taylor</a>. And, for a while, it worked.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West on October 2, 2022." class="wp-image-506895" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_kanyewest_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Balenciaga Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on October 02, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jacopo M.

<p>In politics, in pop culture, and in everyday life, the world is full of stories of men who become <em>deeply weird</em> about a woman. Whether it&#8217;s a crush or insecurities or misogyny or some sick combination of the three, he can&#8217;t seem to leave her alone.</p>



<p>Now, Taylor&#8217;s success is inescapable. Seriously &#8212; you cannot escape it. Many of us are even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/travis-kelce-living-with-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning about football against our will</a> because of her boyfriend.</p>



<p>As for Kanye? Well, clearly a lot of people listened to <em>Vultures 2</em>. Just not as many as he might hope or expect. That he lost to Taylor Swift is, of course, just frosting on the cake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-the-end-of-an-era-for-ye">Is this the end of an era for Ye?</h2>



<p>In recent years, Kanye West has alienated countless fans with his gleeful antisemitism alongside a host of adjacent stances, rants, and behaviors. At the same time, he has cemented himself as an antagonist in the minds of his existing detractors.</p>



<p>Obviously, the &#8220;<em>separate the art from the artist</em>&#8221; folks might listen to his music no matter what. If they also happen to like his music, anyway. But he&#8217;s certainly driven away more fans than he&#8217;s attracted.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Kanye could (likely with psychiatric help) remedy his behavior, do an apology tour, and restore his image. But it seems unlikely that he&#8217;s going to do that of his own volition any time soon. Perhaps his music falling out of favor will be the wakeup call that he needs &#8212; eventually.</p>

<p>Ed Kelce believes Kanye West is mentally unstable and he just let both the rapper and the entire world know it.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a sentence we didn&#8217;t exactly think we&#8217;d be writing today.</p>



<p>However, the father of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce &#8212; also known, of course, as Taylor Swift&#8217;s loving and totally awesome boyfriend &#8212; had quite the response this week after hearing Kanye West&#8217;s new track, &#8220;Lifestyle (Demo).&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-1024x682.jpg" alt="Ed Kelce and Taylor Swift" class="wp-image-506816" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1968532255-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift is seen on the field with Ed Kelce after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on January 28, 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.<span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Specifically, Ed took issue with a lyric that referenced both Swift and his son.</p>



<p>“Mental illness on full display,” he wrote via Facebook on Thursday, August 8, reposting a Daily Mail article about the lyrical inclusion.</p>



<p>West, it&#8217;s worth noting, actually <em>has</em> been diagnosed with bipolar disorder&#8230; and he name-dropped the super famous couple on the aforementioned single.</p>



<p>&#8220;I twist my Taylor spliffs tight at the end like Travis Kelce,” Kanye raps, making a pun on Swift’s first name and Travis’ NFL position.</p>



<p>He has, of course, said MUCH worse about Taylor in previous songs.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="602" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-1024x602.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce is awesome" class="wp-image-506822" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-1024x602.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-768x452.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-2048x1205.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-960x565.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-1080x635.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153614375-1200x706.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce interacts with fans during Kelce Jam 2024 at Azura Amphitheater on May 18, 2024 in Bonner Springs, Kansas. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Fernando Leon/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in February 2016, Kanye released the song “Famous,” which featured the following controversial lyric: <em>I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. / Why? I made that bitch famous.</em></p>



<p>Swift pushed back <strong><em>hard</em></strong> against such an insulting line, and a leaked recording of a phone call between her and West eventually proved that she did NOT give the artist permission to say any such thing in any verse of any single.</p>



<p>Taylor, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/11/taylor-swift-slams-kanye-west-hard-in-new-song/">has seemingly referenced Kanye</a> and her ongoing feud with this loser on multiple occasions; via tracks such as &#8220;I Did Something Bad&#8221; and &#8220;This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been an ongoing battle for over a decade now &#8212; although it&#8217;s also been rather one-sided, to be honest. </p>



<p>Swift has clearly come out on top.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift in purple" class="wp-image-506824" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160634794-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift performs on stage during  &#8220;Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour&#8221; at Johan Cruijff Arena on July 4, 2024 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Carlos Alvarez/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And so now here we are again, to some extent, with Ed Kelce hilariously getting himself involved.</p>



<p>Neither Taylor nor Travis have publicly addressed this West name drop. </p>



<p>The pop star’s fans, however, are under the impression that that she subtly left an Easter egg during her August 3 concert in Warsaw, Poland.</p>



<p>In the middle of her Red set, Swift sported a graphic T-shirt that read “I Bet You Think About Me.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift strums the guitar" class="wp-image-506827" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2160626489-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift plays the guitar.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Carlos Alvarez/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking late last year to Time Magazine, Swift reflected on the ugly nature of her relationship with both West and his ex-wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>, citing the controversy over the lyrics referenced above.</p>



<p>“Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/taylor-swift-named-time-person-of-the-year-finally-opens-up-about-travis-kelce/">Taylor said at the time</a>.</p>



<p>“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar.</p>



<p>“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. </p>



<p>&#8220;I went down really, really hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wife of Kanye West, Bianca Censori, is accused of sending porn to Yeezy employees.</p>



<p>This spring, we reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/kanye-west-sued-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West&#8217;s former assistant is suing him</a>. She is not the only one taking him to court.</p>



<p>Another lawsuit accuses him of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kanye-west-broke-begging-kim-kardashian-for-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major financial wrongdoing</a> and an abhorrent workplace environment in which employees were degraded as &#8220;slaves&#8221; and were not properly paid. And there&#8217;s more.</p>



<p>The lawsuit does not target Kanye&#8217;s wife, Bianca Censori. But it does describe her as having sent porn to at least one employee.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West and wife Bianca Censori in February of 2024." class="wp-image-503080" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0701_kanyewest_01_biancacensori-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West and Bianca Censori attend the Marni Fall/Winter 2024 Fashion Show during the Milan Fashion Week &#8211; Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025 on February 23, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Alessandro Levati/Getty Images for Marni Srl)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-and-wife-bianca-censori-are-both-accused-of-nsfw-behavior-in-the-workplace">Kanye West and wife Bianca Censori are both accused of NSFW behavior in the workplace</h2>



<p><em>TMZ </em>obtained <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/06/30/kanye-west-sued-new-slaves-bianca-porn-racial-discrimination-milo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a> in the lawsuit against Kanye West.</p>



<p>That legal filing alleges that Bianca Censori, the wife of Kanye West, shared a link to &#8220;hardcore&#8221; sexual content with one of his employees.</p>

The filing includes allegations that these videos were also accessible to staffers who were minors. </p>

<p>As we mentioned, the lawsuit does not name Bianca Censori as a defendant. Rather, it targets Kanye West and his former chief of staff, notorious alt-right &#8220;influencer&#8221; Milo Yiannopoulos.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the two of them did not properly pay employees for their long hours as they worked to complete a Yeezy porn app by May 1. </p>



<p>The lawsuit specifically describes West and Yiannopoulos of &#8220;forced labor and cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment&#8221; of employees. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-lawsuit-includes-things-much-worse-than-inappropriate-texts">The lawsuit includes things much worse than inappropriate texts</h2>



<p>According to court documents, employees were subjected to racist remarks and referred to as &#8220;new slaves&#8221; while working on app development.</p>



<p>Notably, <em>Buzzfeed </em>confirmed in 2017 that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism#.grEVqB2aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milo Yiannopoulos conspired</a> with various white nationalists, including those who write for explicitly Neo-Nazi publications, to push white nationalism into the conservative mainstream. As such, these remarks and this sort of abhorrent work culture are tragically unsurprising.</p>



<p>Oddly enough, Kanye&#8217;s porn studio aspirations drove Yiannopolous to resign. One of the cornerstones of fascist ideology is an opposition to expression of human sexuality and a desire to strictly control art. Despite <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kanye-west-praises-hitler-actually-says-out-loud-nazis-arent-so-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s outspoken fondness for Hitler</a> and employment of infamous white nationalists, he&#8217;s clearly not fully in lockstep with some of the targets of their &#8220;culture war.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the financial side, the lawsuit describes it as less incendiary but no less insidious.</p>



<p>Allegedly, Milo Yiannopoulos should have paid the employees $120,000 when the app was complete. The condition was that they work demanding hours &#8212; without complaint.</p>



<p>There were non-discrimination agreements, and allegedly they received orders to sign them or risk termination without pay. The lawsuit also says that minors &#8212; some of whom were Black and from other countries, even under the age of 14 &#8212; had to sign &#8220;volunteer&#8221; agreements.</p>

<p>She is the wife of Kanye West, and does not appear to have been anyone&#8217;s employer or supervisor. In most cases, a boss&#8217; romantic partner should not be sending NSFW material to their employees.</p>



<p>But the real focus appears to be on alleged unpaid wages and outrageous, inhuman treatment.</p>



<p>The lawsuit against Kanye West and Milo Yiannapoulos seeks money owed as well as emotional damages. </p>
