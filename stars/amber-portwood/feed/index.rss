<p>Amber Portwood has a long history of not taking accountability for her actions.</p>



<p>This history inevitably includes reactions of extreme outrage when anyone recalls her misdeeds. She feels that she is entitled to forgiveness, no matter what.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this means that watching <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/amber-portwoods-daughter-takes-steps-toward-being-adopted-by-kristina-shirley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leah</a> exclude her from her 16th birthday party and pass on her gift sent Amber into a rage spiral.</p>



<p>She may say that she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/amber-portwood-quit-teen-mom-allegedly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">done with <em>Teen Mom</em></a>, but she isn&#8217;t done watching and angrily reacting on social media.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-even-though-amber-portwood-says-that-she-s-done-with-teen-mom-she-s-still-tuning-in">Even though Amber Portwood says that she&#8217;s done with &#8216;Teen Mom,&#8217; she&#8217;s still tuning in</h2>



<p>Amber Portwood is still watching <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>, presumably so that at least <em>one </em>of the viewers will be sympathetic to Amber&#8217;s side of things.</p>



<p>This meant that she watched Leah celebrate turning 16. She celebrated this milestone birthday without Amber, whom she very understandably did not want there.</p>



<p>Leah discussed her &#8220;abandonment issues&#8221; dating back to age 8 (which barely scratches the surface on Amber&#8217;s whole deal). And she also rejected the gift and the card that Amber had sent over.</p>

<p>Faced with such a scene, many parents might express the guilt that they feel for having a child who has spent half of her life aware that their mom is not fully present in her life. </p>



<p>That &#8230; was not the emotional direction that Amber selected.</p>



<p>Taking to TikTok live, which is more or less always a mistake, Amber shared: “I’m feeling emotional right when it comes to what I just saw.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-those-aren-t-boundaries-is-not-a-good-way-to-respect-boundaries">&#8216;Those aren&#8217;t boundaries&#8217; is not a good way to respect boundaries</h2>



<p>One of the replies &#8212; again, this was live &#8212; noted that Leah Shirley had created some very valid boundaries for herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Amber spat in response. “Those aren’t boundaries. I’m her mother. It’s disrespect.”</p>



<p>Pretty famously, narcissists dislike boundaries because they represent a loss of control. </p>



<p>(One also has to ask &#8230; in what way does Amber believe that she deserves special levels of respect from anyone, let alone Leah?)</p>

<p>Amber continued her rant, demanding: “What? Did I beat her? Is that what I did? Is that what you’re saying.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well &#8230; in addition to physically assaulting <em>both </em>of her baby daddies, teen Amber is shown on camera encouraging Gary Shirley to hit the then-very-young Leah. (Gary did not respond positively to this demand)</p>



<p>It may also be worth noting that parenting is not the story of the Billy Goats Gruff. You don&#8217;t get a pass so long as there&#8217;s a worse parent &#8212; or a billion worse parents &#8212; out there.</p>



<p>“Nobody’s told me to be accountable, darling!” Amber raged on TikTok. “Did you do time in prison? Did you do my time in prison?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-see-no-one-understands-how-hard-leah-s-childhood-has-been-on-amber">See, no one understands how hard Leah&#8217;s childhood has been on Amber</h2>



<p>“Did you sit and talk with my daughter and sit down with her and let her know that you were an addict and everything that happened to you?” Amber&#8217;s rant went on. </p>



<p>“Were you … in my shoes when I had to sit there and go through everything I had to do?!&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Were you paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be in your children’s lives?”</p>



<p>Making a perhaps too-on-the-nose analogy, Amber insisted: “I’ve done nothing in my life, <em>darling</em>, then try to be in my daughter’s life and was pushed out like a cancer!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p> However, as you can see here, Amber eventually changed her tone in a follow-up <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thepinktea_/video/7487326350882114859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok Live</a> video.</p>



<p>“I didn’t see what her reaction was,” Amber said tearfully, having watched the scene where Leah rejects her gift and card. “It’s the only thing in my life, guys, that hurts me.&#8221; Clearly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just want to see my daughter,&#8221; Amber lamented. She continued: &#8220;It’s so hard. I don’t want to make this [Live] for anybody else.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Teen Mom: Family Reunion, Amber Portwood acknowledged that she&#8217;s not necessarily a &#8220;good mom.&#8221; Viewers and family court have clearly drawn similar conclusions over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teen-mom-fans-just-haven-t-seen-how-good-of-a-mom-she-s-been-in-secret">&#8216;Teen Mom&#8217; fans just haven&#8217;t seen how good of a mom she&#8217;s been (in secret)</h2>



<p>“I promise. My hand on the Bible, I did. [I was] consistent, I promise,” Amber insisted, claiming that she was a good mom in ways that viewers have never seen. She continued: “I did exactly what she wanted. I came when the cameras weren’t there, when she brought that up, I promise.&#8221;</p>



<p>She claimed: “I’ve got so many pictures and so many videos that I’ve never posted of us together. Just to keep her from not feeling embarrassed.”</p>



<p>Naturally, some of the commenters suggested to Amber that her emotionally volatile rants on social media might further alienate Leah. Amber was not inclined to take their advice. Perhaps that is for the best, for Leah&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>Amber Portwood says that she has quit <em>Teen Mom</em>.</p>



<p>Even though the <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> star has been open about not having a good time.</p>



<p>Viewers have seen her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/amber-portwood-pregnancy-scare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lie to producers</a> and then admit to it.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-amber-portwood-quit-teen-mom-for-real-this-time">Has Amber Portwood quit &#8216;Teen Mom&#8217; for real this time?</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Amber Portwood has been posting unending rants on TikTok. So much so that she received a temporary ban from the pernicious video platform after her comments about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/amber-portwood-leah-kristina-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Shirley</a>.</p>



<p>For better or for worse, she has been part of the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise since she made her <em>16 and Pregnant</em> debut in 2009.</p>



<p>Now, Amber claims that, earlier this week, she told the <em>Teen Mom</em> bigwigs that she&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>In particular, Amber Portwood seemed determine to quash reports that MTV has fired her.</p>



<p>“You’re not about to say that you’re dropping me when I quit [the show] three days ago!” she announced. “And I told the producer that.”</p>



<p>Amber then taunted: “…You think this is going to be easy, with me going, after what’s going on?” Amber continued. “You think I’m scared? Like, y’all know I ain’t got that kind of fear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They know that, not only do I not fear that, but I don’t care,&#8221; Amber Portwood insisted.</p>



<p>&#8220;How you gonna cancel somebody who doesn’t give a damn?&#8221; she asked, presumably rhetorically.</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re gonna cancel me? Because I already quit, so nice try guys,&#8221; Amber went on (and on). &#8220;Nice try. I already got ahold of my agent. &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Obviously, given Amber Portwood&#8217;s history of atrocious and at times criminal behavior, a lot of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </em>viewers would not object to seeing her go.</p>



<p>A lot of people feel attached to Leah. Many felt done with Amber the <em>first </em>time that she violently attacked the father of her child. Even more felt the same way after the second incident with the second baby daddy.</p>



<p>It would be nice if MTV could continue to showcase Leah&#8217;s life, exactly as much as she likes, without delving into Amber&#8217;s role. After all, Amber has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/amber-portwoods-daughter-takes-steps-toward-being-adopted-by-kristina-shirley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very little to do with Leah</a> these days. And that is for the best, for Leah&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>However, even some of Amber&#8217;s most resolute critics worry about her. And not just because it&#8217;s unclear how she would make a living without reality television.</p>



<p>Some have pointed out that her nonstop ranting and the comments &#8212; in which she seems to feel unstoppable and doesn&#8217;t care which bridges she burns &#8212; seem like a manic episode. Amber has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.</p>



<p>If it helps, <em><a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/03/15/amber-portwood-says-she-quit-teen-mom-this-week-encourages-catelynn-lowell-to-leave-show-too-it-feels-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley</a></em> reports that there&#8217;s no evidence that Amber Portwood has quit. Rather, it looks like she&#8217;s actively trying to be fired. Her lack of an invitation to the Reunion that recorded in January shows that her efforts may be paying off.</p>

<p>On this week&#8217;s season finale of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Amber Portwood learned an important truth.</p>



<p>And tried to send an important message to anyone watching.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="691" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1024x691.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509304" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-768x518.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-960x648.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1080x729.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1200x810.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy.jpg 1665w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood does not look too happy in this photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you might recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">Portwood got engaged to a man named Gary Wayt</a> this past June.</p>



<p>Days later, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/">Wayt disappeared</a>.</p>



<p>Gary was finally discovered days later, thankfully in fine physical condition, only for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-and-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-bizarre-disappearance/">him and Portwood to call off their engagement</a>.</p>



<p>What the heck happened to cause such tension and such a scandal?</p>



<p>Portwood shed some light on events during this episode of the MTV reality show.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="613" height="413" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/86678229-13578183-image-m-2_1719539578480-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509305" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/86678229-13578183-image-m-2_1719539578480-copy.jpg 613w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/86678229-13578183-image-m-2_1719539578480-copy-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood during an episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I guess his dad read my Wikipedia,&#8221; Amber told a producer on the finale&#8230; before a screen capture of her sordid past flasheed across the screen, highlighting her run-ins with the law, along with her abusive history with ex <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/gary-shirley/">Gary Shirley</a>, with whom she shares 15-year-old daughter, Leah.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he was holding in the fact that he maybe heard from his family or something, and not telling me,&#8221; she continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was just saying, &#8216;I can&#8217;t do this. How can we get married then if your family can&#8217;t accept me?&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;And maybe he took that as me breaking up with him. It seemed like, to me, that maybe he was upset and like, hopeless.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="495" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood, a photo" class="wp-image-502759" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood-300x232.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood remains a significant player in the Teen Mom universe.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amber actually learned on air that Gary had been found, although she then realized that he had not reached out to her afterward.</p>



<p>The mother of two considered this to be a pretty major &#8220;red flag.&#8221;</p>



<p>From there, Portwood headed to her psychiatrist, saying in the Uber ride over there of Wayt:</p>



<p>&#8220;Right now this man broke me&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was stable. And right now, this was the first time in years in my life &#8212; I am 34 &#8212; I am not f-cking right because a man put a ring on my finger.</p>



<p>&#8220;You broke me because we were actually in love. The day that man left, for no reason. And I&#8217;ma say no reason because there was no f-cking reason, and he ruined something so f-cking good. I am f-cking broken right now.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="861" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood makes a face" class="wp-image-502284" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-768x646.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-960x808.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1080x908.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1200x1009.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f.jpg 1272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has an unusual look on her face in this scene from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t just Gary that broke her, either.</p>



<p>Portwood delved into some of the responses she saw on social media to his vanishing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know how that feels when people are calling you a murderer to your f-cking fiancé?&#8221; Portwood screamed. &#8220;Do you know how that f-cking feels? He doesn&#8217;t know what he did! They were calling me a murderer and they said I f-cking killed him!&#8221;</p>



<p>The finale ended with the couple ending its engagement.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you wanna show what heartbreak is, this is it,&#8221; Amber concluded. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about a man. We had something better than we both have even seen in our lives with other people. </p>



<p>&#8220;He looked at my family, my daughter and just asked to be a big, happy family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amber Portwood doesn&#8217;t sound keen on the idea of anyone adopting Leah &#8212; even the woman who&#8217;s raised her.</p>

<p>The longtime <em>Teen Mom</em> villain found new humiliation after a recent episode featured her eldest, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/gary-shirley-and-amber-portwood-support-leah-going-on-birth-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leah</a>, expressing an interest in a formal adoption by her father&#8217;s wife.</p>



<p>Amber doesn&#8217;t exactly have a reputation for rational or reasonable reactions. How&#8217;s she handling this?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leah-shirley-would-love-for-kristina-to-formally-adopt-her">Leah Shirley would love for Kristina to formally adopt her</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, July 18 episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>, Gary Shirley opened up about 15-year-old Leah Shirley&#8217;s goals.</p>



<p>According to him, she &#8220;wants to be adopted&#8221; by Kristina Shirley.</p>



<p>Gary and Kristina have been together for a long time. Kristina is a mother to her. And, unlike Amber, Kristina seems to be a stable, compassionate, and decent human being.</p>

<p>Gary went on to describe Kristina as &#8220;the best thing that ever happened to Leah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, Gary is a bit biased. Kristina is his wife. They are a parenting team with their kids, including Leah.</p>



<p>But a bias doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;s wrong.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-amber-portwood-feel-about-that">How does Amber Portwood feel about that?</h2>



<p>According to what an inside source tells <em>Us Weekly</em>, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-wouldnt-support-gary-shirleys-wife-adopting-leah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Portwood feels</a> &#8220;devastated&#8221; that Leah would welcome an adoption by Kristina.</p>



<p>“Obviously, any implication that her daughter wants to be adopted is devastating to Amber,” the insider dished.</p>



<p>“Her two kids are the reason Amber wakes up in the morning,&#8221; the source claimed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Teen Mom: Family Reunion, Amber Portwood acknowledged that she&#8217;s not necessarily a &#8220;good mom.&#8221; Viewers and family court have clearly drawn similar conclusions over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The insider, who seems to be very sympathetic to Amber Portwood and her feelings, continued to discuss her children.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are why she continues filming the show,&#8221; the source insisted.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the insider added of her children, they are &#8220;her motivation for everything.”</p>

<p>The source complained: &#8220;This has not been an easy time for Amber on top of dealing with her mental health, which she has been very open about.”</p>

<p>Welp.</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t last long.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">Amber Portwood got engaged to Gary Wayt</a>, we can now confirm the following:</p>



<p>Amber Portwood is no longer engaged to Gary Wayt.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="495" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood, a photo" class="wp-image-502759" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood-300x232.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood remains a significant player in the Teen Mom universe.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>An insider tells Us Weekly that the veteran Teen Mom star has ended her relationship with her short-term fiance in the wake of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/">Wayt disappearing for several days</a>.</p>



<p>“They’ve decided that it’s over between them and their engagement is off,” a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-fiance-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-his-disappearance/">source told this tabloid</a> late Tuesday, adding of Amber and Gary: </p>



<p>“They have too much to overcome to move forward together.”</p>



<p>The anonymous mole said there has “been some closure” for the MTV personality, emphasizing that the former lovers have communicated and Wayt is “not ghosting her.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="861" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood makes a face" class="wp-image-502284" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-768x646.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-960x808.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1080x908.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1200x1009.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f.jpg 1272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has an unusual look on her face in this scene from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not long after the public learned of Portwood&#8217;s engagement, we also learned that Amber and Gary got into some kind of argument while attending Amber&#8217;s brother&#8217;s wedding in North Carolina.</p>



<p>Wayt then vanished.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am worried&#8230; He is a missing person right now,&#8221; Portwood told social media followers at the time.</p>



<p>“Nobody has found or heard from him yet. I’m trying my best to not think the worst. I have not ate [sic] in three days. I slept maybe an hour.”</p>



<p>The Bryson City Police Department confirmed via Facebook that Gary was missing and later confirmed he had been found.</p>



<p>No other details were made available, however.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood picture" class="wp-image-501505" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has had her share of legal trouble over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Portwood herself has not yet confirmed that her engagement is over. However&#8230;</p>



<p>“Amber took off the engagement ring and it’s the best thing,” the insider went on to Us Weekly. </p>



<p>“She is sad and she cares about him, but she is willing to see that he is not the right guy for her. She wants to be with someone who accepts her fully.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/">Portwood was arrested in 2019 for domestic violence </a>and has had run-ins with the law on numerous occasions; she doesn&#8217;t have custody of her son as a result.</p>



<p>This history appears to have also played a role in the break-up.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-1024x682.webp" alt="Amber Portwood on MTV" class="wp-image-501504" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-1024x682.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/amber-portwood-46.webp 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood on an episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Gary’s family was looking her up online and looking at her past and not everything they saw online was true,” the insider continues. “And it was hard for Amber because she’s been trying so hard to move past it and move forward.”</p>



<p>Amber was previously engaged to Matt Baier and then to Gary Shirley, never making it down the aisle either time.</p>



<p>She shares five-year old son James with ex Andrew Glennon and 15-year old daughter Leah with Shirley.</p>



<p>Back in January, a source said that Portwood and Wayt had been seeing each other after connecting on a dating app months earlier. </p>



<p>“They are taking their time getting to know each other, but it’s getting serious,” this person said back then.</p>

<p>First, the good news about Gary Wayt:</p>



<p>He&#8217;s been found, alive and presumably well.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/">Amber Portwood reported that her fiance had gone missing</a> in North Carolina after the couple got into some kind of argument.</p>



<p>Local authorities have since confirmed, however, that Gary is safe and sound.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="861" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood makes a face" class="wp-image-502284" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-768x646.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-960x808.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1080x908.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1200x1009.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f.jpg 1272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has an unusual look on her face in this scene from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, for the bad news when it comes to Gary Wayt:</p>



<p>He sort of has a sketchy past.</p>



<p>According to documents obtained by In Touch Weekly, <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/teen-mom-star-amber-portwoods-fiance-garys-criminal-history/">Wayt has been in trouble</a> with the law on multiple occasions. </p>



<p>For example, the 39-year old pleaded guilty and was convicted of illegal consumption of alcohol in 2005 in the state of Indiana.</p>



<p>One year later, Wayt was charged with possession of marijuana. </p>



<p>The new MTV star requested to have the charges expunged for both incidents in 2014&#8230; but the court refused, instructing Wayt to submit a <em>separate</em> petition along with payment.</p>

<p>Along with these criminal charges, Wayt has been involved in a number of driving incidents. </p>



<p>Also in 2006, Gary was caught driving with a suspended license, eventually pleading guilty to the charge and earning a fine of $1,000.</p>



<p>Two years later, Wayt was caught speeding &#8212; twice. </p>



<p>From 2010 to 2017, Wayt faced <em>additional</em> charges varying from expired plates and speeding to disregarding a stop sign.</p>

<p>Portwood, of course, has also had numerous run-ins with the law, most notably <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/">getting arrested in 2019</a> for allegedly attacking her ex-boyfriend with a machete.</p>



<p>She was previously engaged to Matt Baier, although the two never made it down the aisle.</p>



<p>Wayt, however, actually <em>has</em> been married once before.</p>



<p>He exchanged vows on July 21, 2013 with a woman named Caitlin Haynie … who filed for divorce from her husband in 2016.</p>



<p>They had no kids together and the marriage was officially dissolved on June 7, 2016, as the exes divided property amongst themselves and she kept the lease on their marital home. </p>



<p>The pair did not have any shared vehicles or debt amid the marriage.</p>

<p>Portwood went public with her latest romance this past fall and then introduced Gary t to fans during the June 6 episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">got engaged a few weeks ago</a>.</p>



<p>“She’s really, really happy,” a Us Weekly source told the tabloid upon breaking this exciting piece of news, adding:</p>



<p>“They’ve been in couple’s therapy and talk about everything. They’re being very proactive in their relationship and are doing the work to prevent problems before they start.”</p>



<p>This was before the aforementioned fight and subsequent disappearance, but hopefully all hope is not lost for Amber Portwood and Gary </p>



<p>“This new man in her life has actually never seen Teen Mom so she feels she can finally date in the way she’s always wanted to,&#8221; Us Weekly added this month.</p>

<p>For Amber Portood, what ought to be a celebratory time has turned into something very different.</p>



<p>It has turned into a nightmare.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, you see, we reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">Portwood was engaged to her boyfriend Gary</a>, not long after the latter made his debut on MTV&#8217;s Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</p>



<p>Mere days later?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1005" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335.webp" alt="Amber Portwood on an episode of MTV's Teen Mom." class="wp-image-501864" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335.webp 1005w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335-300x161.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335-768x413.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335-960x516.webp 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood on an episode of MTV&#8217;s Teen Mom.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gary went missing.</p>



<p>As previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-fiance-missing/">Portwood&#8217;s fiance vanished</a> after he and Amber got into some sort of argument while they were in North Carolina for the Teen Mom star&#8217;s brother&#8217;s wedding.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night, meanwhile, Amber opened up about this concerning development for the first time.</p>



<p>“This is a huge deal, his parents, everybody is very worried. I am worried,” the 34-year old said in a YouTube stream on June 11. </p>



<p>“There was not a big blowout fight or anything like that. He is a missing person right now.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood picture" class="wp-image-501505" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has had her share of legal trouble over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Portwood is not being dramatic here. </p>



<p>A couple days ago, the Bryson City Police Department confirmed via Facebook that Gary was missing.</p>



<p>Described in the police report as 6-foot-1 male weighing 205 pounds with brown eyes and a bald head, Gary drives a 2009 gray Nissan Rogue SUV with Indiana state registration plates.</p>



<p>Anyone with information on Gary’s whereabouts has been asked to call 828-488-2196 and ask for Chief Robinson or Asst. Chief Dover.</p>

<p>“Nobody has found or heard from him yet,” the Teen Mom star continued on YouTube. “I’m trying my best to not think the worst. I have not ate [sic] in three days. I slept maybe an hour.”</p>



<p>The mother of two acknowledged that she and Gary got into a fight while staying in an Airbnb for her brother&#8217;s big day &#8212; but she has denied any reports of violence.</p>



<p>“There was no explosive argument. You guys have to understand, okay?” Amber told viewers. </p>



<p>“I am not what people have been saying about me all of these years. I changed a long time ago, okay? You guys have to understand this. Please listen to what I’m saying. I’m an honest person to you guys.”</p>



<p>Back in 2019, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/">Portwood was arrested for allegedly attacking</a> ex-boyfriend Andrew Glennon with a machete.</p>



<p>She lost custody of her son James as a result.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not had explosive fights,” Amber continued of her and Gary. </p>



<p>“We are very in love. This man asked me to be with him. This man asked me to marry him. I have not touched this man in any horrible way. He does not touch me in any horrible way. We do not yell at each other. </p>



<p>&#8220;We have a wonderful relationship, please understand this. People change.”</p>



<p>In general, Portwood is looking for any sort of help she can get. She&#8217;s even turning to a higher power amid this panic-stricken situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’m praying for anybody that sees him,” Amber said. “Nobody has found him or heard from him yet. They only know that he was in a Walgreens [the day he went missing] alone on camera and that is all we know.</p>



<p>&#8220;So please, everybody, do not think the harshest things right now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just please pray, do whatever, like, whatever your religion is, just please hope that he is OK. Just hope he’s okay.”</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Portwood&#8217;s former fiance, Matt Baier, even commented on this scary disappearance.</p>



<p>“I think the focus should be on hoping for a safe return,” Baier Tweeted. “The situation is hard enough for his loved ones and ppl throwing accusations around makes the situation harder for the ppl that love and care about him.”</p>

<p>Congratulations are reportedly in order for Amber Portwood who is engaged to her new man!</p>



<p>According to <em>Us Weekly,</em> the polarizing MTV personality is engaged to her boyfriend, someone named Gary who recently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-new-boyfriend/">made his </a><em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-new-boyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teen Mom </a></em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-new-boyfriend/">debut</a><em>.</em></p>



<p>This outlet wrote a couple days ago that the <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-moms-amber-portwood-is-engaged-to-boyfriend-gary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal took place</a> “within the last two weeks,” adding that Portwood’s engagement ring was crafted from “a family stone that was reset into a new ring.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amber-portwood-engaged-her-next-chapter">Amber Portwood Engaged: Her Next Chapter </h2>



<p>Simply put?</p>



<p>“She’s really, really happy,” the tabloid claims of Portwood.</p>



<p>Amber hasn&#8217;t said very much in public about Gary, who, just to be clear, is NOT the father of her oldest child, Gary Shirley. This is a different guy named Gary.</p>



<p>The betrothed couple met about nine months ago on a dating app.</p>



<p>All we really know about this new Gary is that he is in his late 30s&#8230; does not have children of his own&#8230; has never watched <em>Teen Mom</em>&#8230; and resides near Amber’s hometown of Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Reports the <em>Us Weekly</em> insider:</p>



<p>&#8220;They’ve been in couple’s therapy and talk about everything. They’re being very proactive in their relationship and are doing the work to prevent problems before they start.”</p>



<p>This is good to know &#8212; because Amber has had her share of problems.</p>



<p>She allegedly threatened ex-boyfriend Andrew Glennon with a machete in 2019.</p>



<p>In response to this incident, and other violent incidents involving the MTV personality, Glennon previously filed a motion to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/amber-portwood-files-emergency-motion-amber-portwood-should-never-see-our-son/">prevent Portwood from seeing the ex-couple&#8217;s son</a>.</p>

<p>Portwood’s personal life has been chronicled on reality television ever since she first appeared on 16 and Pregnant in 2009. </p>



<p>She later became a cast member on Teen Mom and Teen Mom OG from 2009 to 2021. </p>



<p>The mother of two returned to the franchise for 2022’s Teen Mom: Family Reunion and 2023’s Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</p>



<p>Portwood shares daughter Leah with Shirley, to whom she was engaged on two occasions; and also son James with Glennon, who she dated from 2017 to 2019.</p>



<p>Portwood was engaged back in 2015 to Matt Baier.</p>

<p>As cited above, Gary made his debut on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter during the June 6 episode, with Amber formally introducing him to her costars as her “boyfriend” during a group Zoom call. </p>



<p>“We are now officially a couple,” she added.</p>



<p>Why might this relationship last?</p>



<p>“All the guys Amber has dated before she met on social media and were fans of the show,” Us Weekly explained late last week. </p>



<p>“This new man in her life has actually never seen Teen Mom so she feels she can finally date in the way she’s always wanted to.”</p>

<p>Amber Portwood is hoping that the second time is the charm.</p>



<p>Or, to perhaps be more specific and accurate, she&#8217;s hoping that the second Gary in her romantic life ends up being her Prince Charming.</p>



<p>The <em>Teen Mom</em> standout has taken on a new lover. Not a lot was known about this individual, except his first name is the same as her ex-boyfriend, Gary Shirley.</p>



<p>But now he&#8217;s made it onto the show and the <em>Teen Mom </em>gang has THOUGHTS. </p>

<p>&#8220;She met him on a dating app four months ago,&#8221; an <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-moms-amber-portwood-getting-serious-with-new-boyfriend-gary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider </a>told Us Weekly back in January 2024. That&#8217;s when the pair go together and have been going strong since. </p>



<p>&#8220;They are taking their time getting to know each other, but it’s getting serious.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the time, all that hd been confirmed about this second Gary was that he resided in Indianapolis, the same town as Amber.</p>

<p>Unlike past men Portwood has dated, Gary never watched <em>Teen Mom</em>. He wasn&#8217;t familiar with Portwood&#8217;s past before they met, the source explains.</p>

<p>“This new man in her life has actually never seen Teen Mom so she feels she can finally date in the way she’s always wanted to.”</p>



<p>Well, he&#8217;s likely seen the show now &#8212; since he just made his debut in the new season. </p>

<p>During the Thursday, June 6, episode of <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/shows/teen-mom/"><em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em></a>, Amber showed up in a group Zoom with her costars, including Cheyenne Floyd, Maci Bookout and Catelynn Baltierra.</p>



<p>As the conversation got underway, Amber welcomed in her new man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is my boyfriend,” Amber said as Gary popped into the chat, officially making his debut on the MTV show. “We are now officially a couple.”</p>



<p>Her boyfriend gave the ladies a smile, before introducing himself, “Hello everybody. My name is actually Gary believe it or not.”</p>



<p>The irony was not lost on the cast and some even couldn’t help but laugh. “Maybe this is the Gary for you,” Jade Cline joked during the call. Amber quickly replied, “It seems like it.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amber-s-rocky-road-back-to-normal">Amber&#8217;s Rocky Road Back To Normal </h2>



<p>Over the past couple of years, you see, Amber has been in the news for all the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>She was accused last summer<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/andrew-glennon-claims-amber-portwood-bloodied-sons-lip-refused-to-bathe-him/"> of bloodying her son&#8217;s lip and of refusing to bathe him</a>, allegations that came out amid her ugly custody battle with ex Andrew Glennon.</p>



<p>“Petitioner genuinely fears for the minor child’s safety in Respondent’s care and believes that it would endanger the child’s physical health and well-being and significantly impair the child’s emotional development for Respondent to exercise parenting time at this time,” Glennon told the court last July as he attempted to limit Amber&#8217;s time with son James.</p>



<p>“Petitioner believes that it is in the child’s best interest that Respondent’s parenting time with the minor child be suspended immediately pending further Order of this Court.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood tries to set the record straight on her arrest in this scene from Teen Mom OG.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Glennon was granted permission by a judge last year to move to California with James, leaving Portwood behind in Indiana.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t get to see the toddler very often at all.</p>



<p>Portwood, meanwhile, made her reality television debut on 16 and Pregnant in 2009 before becoming a cast member on Teen Mom and Teen Mom OG. </p>



<p>She returned to MTV for 2022’s Teen Mom: Family Reunion <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/amber-portwood-fired-from-teen-mom-the-next-chapter-after-emergency-family-court-hearing/">and eventually got fired</a> from 2023’s Teen Mom: The Next Chapter due to her many legal obstacles.</p>



<p>“I’ve worked so hard to better myself and improve my relationships with my children,” the reality star said after Glennon was awarded custody of James many months ago. </p>



<p>“While I’ve always been candid about my past substance abuse and struggles with mental illness, a person should have the chance to redeem themselves and not be tethered to their problems from the past.”</p>

<p>Was Amber Portwood fired from the <em>Teen Mom </em>franchise – or did she quit?</p>



<p>In 2023, Amber fans were put through the ringer, with new drama seemingly popping up every week</p>



<p>But the big question for most was if Amber would be returning for <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> Season 2 when it happens &#8211; or has she been cut loose given all of her legal woes?</p>



<p>Here’s what we know so far.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amber-portwood-fired-from-teen-mom-or-quit">Amber Portwood: Fired From &#8216;Teen Mom&#8217; Or Quit?</h2>



<p><em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> was a smash hit for MTV in the summer of 2023, and many have been waiting for the official announcement for Season 2.</p>



<p>The big question remains, however – will Amber return?</p>



<p>The answer feels like a resounding no, but the reason is more complicated than that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, sources reported that Amber was fired from the series after the first season for a myriad of reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For one, her ongoing legal battles are concerning, especially since they keep her away from her son, James. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-482313" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0825_teenmom_09_amberportwood.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">While clutching an eye-catching cup, Amber Portwood wishes that she had been able to access the same basic healthcare that her teen daughter now can.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the other hand, her volatile feud with Ashley Jones during the reunion special reported irked MTV producers, motivating them to cancel their arrangement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amber nor MTV has yet to make an official announcement either way, but there was a report as of February 2023 that suggested Amber was ready to walk away from the show on her own terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Amber is officially leaving Teen Mom,&#8221; the insider told <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/7308422/teen-mom-amber-portwood-quits-teen-mom-official-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was her own decision. She was not fired,&#8221; the source claimed, and added that the reality star &#8220;will be making an announcement within the next few days.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teen-mom-the-next-chapter-season-2-is-happening">&#8216;Teen Mom: The Next Chapter&#8217; Season 2: Is Happening?<br></h2>



<p>The first season of <em>Next Chapter</em> was a big it with franchise fans as it brought together women who were originally part of <em>16 &amp; Pregnant and Teen Mom’s first seasons.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The show not only featured Amber, but it also had&nbsp; Maci McKinney, Jade Cline, Catelynn Baltierra, Ashley Jones, Leah Messer, Cheyenne Floyd, and Briana DeJesus.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as of now, there has been no official announcement on if Teen Mom: The Next Chapter’s second season will be happening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But stay tuned!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Teen Mom: Family Reunion, Amber Portwood acknowledged that she&#8217;s not necessarily a &#8220;good mom.&#8221; Viewers and family court have clearly drawn similar conclusions over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-andrew-glennon-drama-that-complicated-things-nbsp">The Andrew Glennon Drama That Complicated Things&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While her future as an MTV reality star may be on the line, Amber has had bigger problems to deal with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an entire year, Amber was at war with her ex Andrew Glennon over custody of their son, James.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May 2023, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/amber-portwood-files-emergency-motion-amber-portwood-should-never-see-our-son/">Andrew Glennon filed an emergency motion</a> to end Amber’s visitations with James.</p>



<p>At the time, he was seeking to suspend Amber&#8217;s visits with their 5-year-old son</p>



<p>Fans who caught the first season of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </em>watched as Amber crumbled after losing custody of James earlier in the year</p>



<p>Since that time, the deal had been that James lived primarily with Andrew in Malibu, but has monthly visits with Amber.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="835" height="917" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air.png" alt="Amber Portwood on Air" class="wp-image-56891" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air.png 835w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-273x300.png 273w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-768x843.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-735x807.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-305x335.png 305w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-316x347.png 316w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-474x520.png 474w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-583x640.png 583w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/amber-portwood-on-air-699x768.png 699w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood looks on in this scene from a 2020 episode of the show Teen Mom OG.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Every other month, Andrew and James flew out to see Amber in Indiana. On the alternate months, Amber flew&nbsp; out to Southern California.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know what evidence Andrew presented, or what Amber said in her defense. This is an ongoing case.</p>



<p>However, do know that since then, Amber has had limited vistations with James and is continuing to fight not only with time with her son, but also for money from Andrew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her attorney filed a motion to deny Andrew&#8217;s efforts, and demanded that Andrew reimburse her legal fees over this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happened-to-gary-and-amber">What Happened To Gary and Amber?</h2>



<p>But this is not the first time that Amber has been in deep drama with an ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When fans first met Amber on the MTV’s 16 and Pregnant, she was expecting her first baby with her boyfriend <strong>Gary Shirley</strong>.</p>



<p>On November 11, 2008, the young couple welcomed Leah.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Whether she is living her life on camera, engaging with critics on social media, or discussing life on the Teen Mom Reunion, Amber Portwood lets people know when she is angry. As she did, here, in 2021.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Amber and Gary were briefly engaged, they ultimately separated in 2011.</p>



<p>Famously,&nbsp; Amber was charged with three counts of domestic violence against Gary, following a physical dispute that aired on the MTV show <em>Teen Mom</em> in 2010.</p>



<p>After that, Gary retained full custody of Leah, but more recently, both parents have come under fire for how they’ve been raising their now teenage daughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amber and Gary were slammed by fans for having a personal conversation about their daughter Leah on camera without her consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one scene, Gary talks openly about her teenage daughter’s visits to the gynecologist with his new wife; in another, they discuss her therapy and if it’s really impacting her mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not the sort of topics that should be shared with the world about someone who didn’t ask for it.</p>
