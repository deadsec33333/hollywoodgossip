<p>Is Kelly Ripa considering a divorce?</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/kelly-ripa-diet-how-does-the-star-stay-so-energetic-thin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved daytime host</a> herself, the concept of a &#8220;gray divorce&#8221; has come up with her husband.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t a rumor. Kelly discussed it openly and in front of her audience.</p>



<p>Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos have been one of the hottest famous couples on the planet for decades. Is it the end of an era?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-kelly-ripa-and-mark-consuelos-discussed-divorce">Have Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos discussed divorce?</h2>



<p>The answer is both yes and no. </p>



<p>During the October 11 episode of <em>Live With Kelly and Mark</em>, Kelly Ripa addressed gray divorce. And she mentioned how she&#8217;d <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/shannen-doherty-last-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought up</a> the topic with husband Mark Consuelos.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was reading this article, and I started talking to Mark about it, and Mark got very defensive,&#8221; Kelly recalled to her audience.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa on March 10, 2024." class="wp-image-511027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa attend the 96th Annual Academy Awards on March 10, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Kelly Ripa, when she brought up gray divorce, Mark Consuelos asked her: &#8220;&#8216;Why are you reading that article?'&#8221;</p>



<p>As it turns out, it had come from reading a &#8220;fascinating&#8221; article that she read at the airport. Millions of people have read articles, books, and more that they otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have while occupying the liminal space at airports. There are entire industries devoted to helping people pass the time.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Mark joked that he knew that Kelly would always take care of him and change his &#8220;diapers.&#8221; In turn, Kelly joked that she was already doing so.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-gray-divorce-exactly">What is &#8216;gray divorce&#8217; exactly?</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/05/kelly-ripa-the-bachelorette-is-disgusting-and-so-are-the-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Ripa explained</a> to her audience, gray divorce refers to divorces happening in couples where (usually both) spouses are over 50. </p>



<p>Though divorce rates have gone down among some age demographics (for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/16oevjo/millennials_have_the_lowest_divorce_rate_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Millennials</a> tend to be more choosy than their parents and grandparents about marrying in the first place), the rate for over-50 divorces has <em>quadrupled </em>in the past 30 years.</p>



<p>Because of this phenomenon, there is a new interest in these divorces &#8212; and the term &#8220;gray divorce&#8221; has appeared as a label, even if most of those involves are not necessarily sporting gray hair just yet.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-1024x681.jpg" alt="Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa as honorees by the Trevor Project in 2019." class="wp-image-511028" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_03-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Champion Award Honorees Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa speak onstage during TrevorLIVE NY 2019 at Cipriani Wall Street on June 17, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images  for The Trevor Project)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Divorce in that demographic can have a lot of factors. Sometimes, couples stay together until their children go off to college. This ill-advised practice can have a number of consequences, including divorcing at an older age &#8212; on at which dating becomes more of a challenge.</p>



<p>As for why rates have increased &#8230; well, the people who are over 50 in 2024 are obviously different than they were in 1990. Though the people from 1990 have not gotten younger, someone who was a college student at that time is now middle-aged.</p>



<p>Different generations have different approaches to marriage. But &#8230; does 54-year-old Kelly Ripa want a divorce from her absurdly handsome 53-year-old husband?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="693" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-693x1024.jpg" alt="Kelly Ripa and hunky husband Mark Consuelos on September 27, 2022." class="wp-image-511029" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-693x1024.jpg 693w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-203x300.jpg 203w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-768x1134.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-1386x2048.jpg 1386w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-650x960.jpg 650w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-731x1080.jpg 731w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-812x1200.jpg 812w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_kellyripa_markconsuelos_04-scaled.jpg 1733w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos attend the Haute Living Celebrates Kelly Ripa And The Release Of &#8220;Live Wire&#8221; With Parfums de Marly And Telmont Champagne At Scarpetta at Scarpetta on September 27, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Haute Living)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-is-this-the-ned">So, Is This The Ned? </h2>



<p>Kelly Ripa said that the narrator&#8217;s voice was compelling and drew her into the audio &#8212; but that gray divorce itself is a &#8220;dark subject.&#8221; After all, divorcing at 35 is tough, but you&#8217;re probably both able to continue working and restart your life. That&#8217;s much harder a couple of decades later, especially if someone&#8217;s spent decades as a homemaker.</p>



<p>Incidentally, Kelly Ripa once admitted to Kyle Richards on the latter&#8217;s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kyle-richards-is-an-open-book/id1676166337?i=1000650568106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a> that she and Mark Consuelos went to marriage counseling. It was a preventative measure, she explained, especially after they became empty nesters.</p>



<p>So, no. Kelly Ripa read an article on gray divorce, discussed it as a topic with her husband, and shared it with her audience. A little goofy, sure, but not a red flag that one of Hollywood&#8217;s hottest marriages is in its final days.</p>

<p>Shannen Doherty&#8217;s last interview reveals a woman who desperately wanted to live but was sadly aware that she might not be long for this world.</p>

<p>Many have noted that Shannen remained hopeful until the very end.</p>



<p>That hope is evident throughout her recent appearance on Kelly Ripa&#8217;s &#8220;Let&#8217;s Talk Off Camera&#8221; podcast.</p>

<p>Far from dwelling on her illness and her chances for survival, Shannen was focused on her future when she spoke with Ripa.</p>

<p>In fact, she spoke of her desire to find love again following her messy <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/shannen-doherty-divorce-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce from Kurt Iswarienko</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s hard for somebody like me,&#8221; Doherty told Kelly, according to <em><a href="https://parade.com/news/shannen-doherty-last-interview-dating-expiration-date-kelly-ripa-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s hard to go into dating someone when you know they might have an expiration date,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think men handle death and illness… as well as women do. So I think I&#8217;m a very hard sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly disagreed with Shannen&#8217;s assessment of her situation and offered to serve as her matchmaker.</p>



<p>Shannen hesitantly accepted the offer, stating that she wouldn&#8217;t trust the job to anyone else.</p>

<p>Doherty remained optimistic about the possibility of finding love again throughout her final months.</p>



<p>Prior to her interview with Kelly, she spoke with <em><a href="https://people.com/shannen-doherty-found-matchmaker-in-kelly-ripa-8559293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> about her hopes for the future.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was not ready at all before three weeks ago,&#8221; she said at the time. </p>

<p>&#8220;And something happens. There&#8217;s always a trigger, just a moment that you have, somebody says something to you, your ex says one thing to you and you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Okay, yeah, I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good.&#8217; I have closure, and I can move on in a really healthy way,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>While she never married again following her <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/11926917/shannen-doherty-officially-divorce-kurt-iswarienko-terminate-spousal-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split from Iswarienko</a>, Shannen was not without companionship in her final days.</p>



<p>“I have a best friend, a male best friend who we joke that we&#8217;re married,&#8221; she told <em>People</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don’t know if it’s that or if it’s stumbling upon somebody and just feeling an instant connection. I&#8217;m open, and I wasn&#8217;t [before],&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>“I don’t think I’m going to be single forever. I have to love myself and reckon with the past, really, before I can move forward, and now I’m pretty sure I’ll meet somebody &#8212; hopefully soon.”</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to Shannen&#8217;s loved ones during this enormously difficult time.</p>

<p>Kelly Ripa is getting slammed this week for remarks she made during a recent interview with Jenn Tran.</p>

<p>As is customary for stars of the franchise, she promoted the new season by making an appearance on <em>Live! with Kelly and Mark</em>.</p>

<p>In the past, Kelly has not been shy when it comes to expressing her misgivings about<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-bachelorette-2024-season-21-jenn-tran-contestants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the <em>Bachelor</em> franchise</a> and the stars&#8217; chances of finding a lasting relationship.</p>



<p>“You’re drop-dead gorgeous,” Kelly said to Jenn this week, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/ex-bachelor-contestant-calls-out-kelly-ripa-for-offensive-jenn-tran-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“You could meet anybody anywhere, at any time. Why, why, why [<em>The Bachelorette</em>]?&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on to ask why Jenn didn&#8217;t try to meet someone at “medical school” or “the office.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her husband and co-host Mark Consuelos chimed in and noted that Jenn could’ve met someone at “church.”</p>



<p>“I have a question. Where did you meet your husband? On TV, no?” Tran shot back.</p>



<p>Kelly and Mark indeed met when they were costars on All My Children in the ’90s. But as Kelly pointed out, that&#8217;s quite different from meeting on a reality dating show.</p>

<p>“Those are not the same. We were both professional,” Ripa said. </p>



<p>“Are you acting on your show? I didn’t marry [Mark’s character] Mateo Santos. I married Mark Consuelos.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kelly-ripa-gets-slammed-by-former-bachelor-stars">Kelly Ripa Gets Slammed By Former &#8216;Bachelor&#8217; Stars</h2>



<p>Many viewers were critical of Kelly&#8217;s harsh line of questioning, including former <em>Bachelor</em> contestant <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-meet-our-newborn-son/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley Iaconetti</a>.</p>



<p>&#8216;</p>



<p>“It disappoints me when I see that Kelly Ripa has such an ax to grind with the<em> Bachelor</em> franchise,” Ashley said to co-host Ben Higgins on their &#8220;Almost Famous&#8221; podcast this week.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1024x577.webp" alt="Jenn Tran for ABC" class="wp-image-501148" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1024x577.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-768x433.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-960x541.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1200x676.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy.webp 1296w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenn Tran is the first-ever Bachelorette of Asian American descent.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (DISNEY/JOHN FLEENOR)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Every time we have a lead go on the show to promote it, she always seems to be so skeptical of &#8212; a little bit of the lead, and their decision to be the lead &#8212; and also just the process,” she continued.</p>



<p>Ashley went on to allege Ripa “just seems to really shame the show,&#8221; which seems like a fair observation.</p>



<p>“She loves to pick at <em>The Bachelor</em> and <em>The Bachelorette</em>,” Ashley said, adding that there are “so many reality shows out there that are so much more trashy.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Ben agreed that Kelly “definitely doesn’t like the show&#8221; and noted that she gave him a hard time in a similar way when he appeared on <em>Live!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;It makes for an awkward interview,&#8221; Ben noted, before joking:</p>



<p>“I don’t know if they denied her the <em>Bachelorette</em> role at some point.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kelly and Jenn&#8217;s interview ended on a cordial note. </p>



<p>But Ashley and Ben&#8217;s comments probably won&#8217;t convince Kelly that she should become a card-carrying member of Bachelor Nation!</p>

<p>From what we can tell, Kelly Ripa starts each day with a smile on her face.</p>



<p>The veteran host greets viewers with an unmatched enthusiasm ever time they tune in for her morning talk show.</p>



<p>In reality, however?</p>



<p>Ripa starts her day with something else&#8230; at a much earlier point in said day&#8230; in order to come across as the bubbly and svelte star that has made her so famous over the years.</p>

<p>According to nutritionist Dr. Daryl Gioffre, <strong>Ripa begins her day by mixing a scoop</strong> of his Acid-Kicking Green powder, which he describes as dehydrated greens, from his brand Alkamind with a glass of water.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning of the specialized Kelly Ripa diet, though.</p>



<p>After downing her mixture of green powder and water, Ripa has her coffee, blending it with grass-fed butter and Acid-Kicking Coffee Alkalizer. </p>



<p>Ripa doesn&#8217;t eat before going on air, but will <strong>then snack on a green apple</strong>, a few tablespoons of almond butter and/or a teaspoon of cinnamon that she mixes into a porridge-like consistency, also according to Gioffre.</p>

<p>For lunch, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1395363/kelly-ripas-nutritionist-breaks-down-what-she-eats-in-a-typical-day">Gioffre told E! News</a> on Sunday that <strong>Ripa will have a salad topped with microgreens</strong>, sprouts, avocado and raw nuts. </p>



<p>Just like President Obama used to do, she&#8217;ll snack on raw nuts throughout the day, too.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s more of the same for dinner, as Ripa typically munches on a smaller sized version of this same salad.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll add in some steamed vegetables or some sauteed vegetables or some grilled greens,&#8221; the diet expert says. </p>



<p>&#8220;And she likes to have the vegetables in season because they&#8217;re just better for you. And then she&#8217;ll have a protein and that <strong>could be grilled tofu or tahini or some fish protein</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, on occasion, even Kelly Ripa will crave something sweet… which Gioffre says will be his avocado chocolate mousse, made up of avocados, pure vanilla extract, raw cacao, dates and sea salt. </p>



<p>Or&#8230; perhaps she&#8217;ll have his chocolate chia pudding for fiber.</p>



<p>Before Ripa goes to sleep, she&#8217;ll drink this same doctor&#8217;s Acid-Kicking Detox Tea featuring turmeric, ginger, lemon and black pepper.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a lot to keep track of, but that&#8217;s why Ripa pays Gioffre the big bucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, just in time for the new season of <em>The Bachelorette</em>, <a href="/2019/05/kelly-ripa-the-bachelorette-is-disgusting-and-so-are-the-people/">Kelly Ripa slammed the franchise as &quot;disgusting.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Folks on <em>The Bachelor</em> side of things have fired back, but Wendy Williams has a message for both parties.</p>
<p>The show is not that serious, and this feud is stupid as hell.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>For years, Kelly Ripa has ripped into <em>The Bachelor</em> because she thinks that it&#8217;s just no good.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not a fan of <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/tag/the-bachelor"><em>The Bachelor</em></a> or <em>The Bachelorette</em> either,&quot; Wendy assures her audience.</p>
<p>In the episode that aired on Friday, May 17, Wendy makes it clear that she has no horse in this particular race.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s so stupid,&quot; Wendy expresses.</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t see the value in a franchise that is largely about &quot;women parading themselves around.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Like many before her, Wendy is equating <em>The Bachelor</em> to a sort of reverse auction, where a man simply picks his bride from an array of women.</p>
<p>But unlike Kelly, Wendy isn&#8217;t shaming the fans of the series.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on who you are,&quot; Wendy admits. &quot;What you want to do with your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For me,&quot; Wendy shares. &quot;It&rsquo;s degrading.&quot;</p>
<p>For members of the Bachelor Nation, it&#8217;s fun to watch. And for some contestants, it&#8217;s how they&#8217;ve met the loves of their lives.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kelly has been making this same point, on the same network that airs <em>The Bachelor</em>, for years.</p>
<p>&quot;So, this is not a new opinion of Kelly&#8217;s,&quot; Wendy acknowledges.</p>
<p>&quot;And, like she says,&quot; Wendy asks. &quot;Why are we arguing over one guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you know what?&quot; Wendy explains. &quot;It&#8217;s just entertainment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not that serious,&quot; she expresses.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease.jpg" alt="Kelly Ripa with the Tease" class="wp-image-263268" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease.jpg 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-480x480.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-320x320.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-200x200.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-335x335.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-347x347.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-520x520.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But there are two sides to this feud. Kelly is only half of the story.</p>
<p>&quot;In jumps the fight with the host of <em>The Bachelor</em> and the <em>Bachelor </em>creator,&quot; Wendy says.</p>
<p>Shis is referring to Chris Harrison and to Mike Fleiss, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;They didn&#8217;t like what Kelly said,&quot; she notes. &quot;And they let it be known!&quot;</p>
<p>Chris Harrison tweeted, warning the Bachelor Nation that &quot;Kelly Ripa is coming for you and your &#8216;disgusting&#8217; Monday night habit.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="830" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-830x1024.png" alt="Beautiful Hannah Brown" class="wp-image-326171" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-830x1024.png 830w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-243x300.png 243w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-768x948.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-735x907.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-271x335.png 271w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-281x347.png 281w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-421x520.png 421w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-519x640.png 519w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-622x768.png 622w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-778x960.png 778w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-875x1080.png 875w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown.png 931w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It&#8217;s entertaining to see the team behind <em>The Bachelor</em> use this little feud to promote the show, reminding fans of when it airs.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, I&#8217;m thinking,&quot; Wendy says. &quot;As the host, Chris should just stay out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Wendy suggests, Chris should just &quot;be happy he&#8217;s hosting a hit show.&quot;</p>
<p>That is probably true.</p>
<p>Remaining unbothered is often the key to happiness.</p>
<p>But, as we noted, this little controversy is drawing more attention to the franchise at just the right time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Every time that this feud comes up, people are reminded of the new season of <em>The Bachelorette</em>.</p>
<p>That is probably why the network doesn&#8217;t seem to mind Kelly, year in and year out, shaming the viewers. It&#8217;s good publicity.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know if Kelly is actively trying to help the show or just doing so by accident.</p>
<p>But they all get their names in the headlines and nobody goes to jail.</p>
<p>That sounds like a situation where everybody wins to us.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a brief rundown, in case you&#8217;re not caught up on this escalating spat:</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ripa&#8217;s co-host, Ryan Seacrest, informed her that current Bachelorette star Hannah Brown would be appearing on their daytime talk show.</p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t have come as a surprise, as <em>Live!</em> and <em>The Bachelorette</em> are both ABC properties, and it&#8217;s not uncommon for networks to fill airtime with this sort of synergistic cross-promotion.</p>
<p>But Ripa was apparently caught off-guard, as she admitted she has no idea who Hannah is, and she is very much <em>not</em> a fan of <em>The Bachelorette.</em></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;You guys, you know how I feel about the show, it disgusts me,&quot; Ripa told her audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the idea of 25 exceptional women fighting over one ordinary fella, in my opinion,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how I feel, ladies, we are too special to be arguing over a guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From there, Ripa wagged a finger at her own audience, saying,&nbsp;&ldquo;All of you women watch that gross, gross show.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease.jpg" alt="Kelly Ripa with the Tease" class="wp-image-263268" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease.jpg 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-480x480.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-320x320.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-200x200.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-335x335.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-347x347.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-with-the-tease-520x520.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Not surprisingly, the show&#8217;s creator, <a href="/2019/05/chris-harrison-claps-back-at-kelly-ripa-my-disgusting-shows-pay/">Mike Fleiss, was quick to clap back at Ripa</a> with a tweet that many thought crossed the line into impropriety:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, Kelly Ripa,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The Bachelor franchise pays your salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ripa never responded to Fleiss&#8217; provocation but her good friend Ellen Pompeo of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy fame entered the fray on her behalf:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay @fleissmeister&hellip; that&rsquo;s some handle bro!&rdquo; she tweeted.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo Close-Up" class="wp-image-296885" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/ellen-pompeo-close-up-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;Your show does NOT pay @KellyRipa salary. Also we don&rsquo;t attack successful women on our network and men certainly cannot take credit for their success. Don&rsquo;t get me started on your show cuz I&rsquo;m a savage&hellip;. #bachelorsoooowhite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took a break [from Twitter] but had to jump back in the ring for my girl @KellyRipa,&rdquo; Pompeo later added.</p>
<p>Pretty intense stuff.</p>
<p>Surely, the woman at the center of all of this, Hannah Brown, must also have some harsh words for Ripa, right? Well &#8230; not so much.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="830" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-830x1024.png" alt="Beautiful Hannah Brown" class="wp-image-326171" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-830x1024.png 830w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-243x300.png 243w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-768x948.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-735x907.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-271x335.png 271w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-281x347.png 281w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-421x520.png 421w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-519x640.png 519w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-622x768.png 622w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-778x960.png 778w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown-875x1080.png 875w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/beautiful-hannah-brown.png 931w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p><a href="/2019/05/hannah-brown-confronts-kelly-ripa-who-won-their-bachelorette-tet/">Brown appeared on <em>Kelly and Ryan</em> this morning</a>, and while she may have sounded as though she were reading from a script prepared by some network PR goon, she maintained an amicable tone throughout.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, it was one of the most empowering things that I ever have done because I had to push myself and grow as an individual,&quot; Hannah said.</p>
<p>&quot;And I did. And I think that&#8217;s why I decided that I wanted to be the Bachelorette and wanted that so bad.&quot;</p>
<p>We suppose at the end of the day, shows like <em>The Bachelorette</em> are like beauty pageants &#8212; they may seem outdated and sexist to some, but isn&#8217;t it also sexist to tell the women who find fulfillment in them that they&#8217;re not allowed to participate?</p>
<p>Anyway, the important thing is that there&#8217;s no beef between Kelly and Hannah &#8212; but this Ellen Pompeo vs. Mike Fleiss thing? <em>That</em> has potential!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guys, you know how I feel about the show, it disgusts me,&quot; Ripa said during Tuesday&#8217;s <em>Live With Kelly and Ryan</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the idea of 25 exceptional women fighting over one ordinary fella, in my opinion,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how I feel, ladies, we are too special to be arguing over a guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ripa then pointed the finger at her studio audience, blaming them for the show&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you women watch that gross, gross show,&quot; she said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It was <em>The Bachelorette </em>that prompted Ripa&#8217;s rant, but asked about The Bachelor, she stated her belief that the OG dating competition is &ldquo;just as creepy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s all creepy,&quot; Ripa concluded, summing up her thoughts on the long-running franchise.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, the show&#8217;s host, Chris Harrison, and creator, Mike Fleiss, were none too thrilled with Ripa&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>And both took to Twitter to share their thoughts about their fellow ABC employee.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="520" height="714" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison.jpg" alt="Hannah Brown and Chris Harrison" class="wp-image-326379" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison-218x300.jpg 218w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison-244x335.jpg 244w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison-253x347.jpg 253w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison-379x520.jpg 379w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/hannah-brown-and-chris-harrison-466x640.jpg 466w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Harrison was up first, and he went full scorched-earth by siccing his followers on Ripa:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out #BachelorNation Kelly Ripa is coming after you and your &lsquo;disgusting&rsquo; Monday night habit,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>Ripa never responded, but you can bet her mentions lit up like a Christmas tree after that one.</p>
<p>Anyone who remembers <a href="/2019/02/khloe-kardashian-will-she-really-be-the-next-bachelorette/">Mike Fleiss&#8217; feud with Khloe Kardashian</a> knows that he&#8217;s not your typical showrunner.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="499" height="594" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/chris-harrison-on-abc.jpg" alt="Chris Harrison on ABC" class="wp-image-292194" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/chris-harrison-on-abc.jpg 499w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/chris-harrison-on-abc-252x300.jpg 252w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/chris-harrison-on-abc-281x335.jpg 281w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/chris-harrison-on-abc-292x347.jpg 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/chris-harrison-on-abc-437x520.jpg 437w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Fleiss once again cemented his place as one of the most outspoken figures in modern media when he suggested that Ripa wouldn&#8217;t have a job if it weren&#8217;t for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, Kelly Ripa,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The Bachelor franchise pays your salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harsh, but not without some basis in fact.</p>
<p>After all, <em>The Bachelor </em>and <em>The Bachelorette</em> both draw audiences that are several larger than Ripa&#8217;s, and without such primetime juggernauts, the network would likely be forced to make some cuts.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sadly, current series star Hannah Brown has yet to speak out on Ripa&#8217;s commentary.</p>
<p>Of course, with all the <a href="/2019/05/nick-viall-slams-hannah-browns-frontrunner-i-f-king-hate-luke-pa/"><em>Bachelorette</em> hot takes</a> flying around this week, she certainly wouldn&#8217;t be able to respond to everything.</p>
<p>No one can remain in Beast Mode at all times.</p>

<p>First, we learned that <a href="/2019/05/nick-viall-slams-hannah-browns-frontrunner-i-f-king-hate-luke-pa/">Nick Viall flat-out hates Luke Parker</a>, who appears to be Hannah Brown&#8217;s frontrunner at the moment.</p>
<p>(Check out our <em>Bachelorette</em> spoilers if you want to see how that plays out.)</p>
<p>Now, it appears that Kelly Ripa is equally disdainful of the whole freakin&#8217; franchise!</p>
<p>Yes, it may be the creeping apathy that comes with being forced to sit next to Ryan Seacrest every morning, but it seems that Kelly has exactly zero f&#8211;ks to give.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-1024x682.jpg" alt="Kelly Ripa in black jumpsuit" class="wp-image-226998" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-735x489.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-520x346.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-640x426.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kelly-ripa-in-black-jumpsuit-1080x719.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The woman is creeped out by the whole <em>Bachelor/Bachelorette</em> content machine, and she doesn&#8217;t care who knows it!</p>
<p>On today&#8217;s episode of<em> Live With Kelly and Dude From American Idol Who&#8217;s Somehow Still a Thing</em>, Seacrest revealed to Ripa that Hannah Beast herself will be a guest on the show later this week.</p>
<p>Not only did Ripa apparently have no idea who Hannah is, she made no qualms about the fact that she is not a member of Bachelorette nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s an entirely different person?&rdquo; she asked after revealing that she thought Colton Underwood&rsquo;s girlfriend, Cassie Randolph, was the new <em>Bachelorette</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;You guys, you know how I feel about the show, it disgusts me,&quot; Ripa told her bemused audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the idea of 25 exceptional women fighting over one ordinary fella, in my opinion,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how I feel, ladies, we are too special to be arguing over a guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point, Ripa unleashed her fury on the studio audience like <a href="/2019/05/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-5-review-whats-love-got-to-do-w/">Daenerys Targaryen at King&#8217;s Landing</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kelly Ripa in Red" class="wp-image-263272" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kelly-ripa-in-red-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Or she gently chided them for watching a show she doesn&#8217;t like. Same difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having said that,&rdquo; she scolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you women watch that gross, gross show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Okay, so Kelly doesn&#8217;t care for The Bachelor?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But how does she feel about <em>The Bachelorette</em>?</p>
<p>Well, apparently, she thinks it&#8217;s&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all creepy&rdquo; and she describes The Bachelorette as &ldquo;just as creepy&rdquo; as The Bachelor.</p>
<p>So it seems that while there might be some feminist beliefs behind Ripa&#8217;s distaste for the franchise, ultimately she finds the whole idea of a rabid competition with a human being as the reward to be a bit unseemly.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re with her &#8212; but we long ago learned to just shut off that part of our brains on Monday nights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s tell-all book, <em>Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Story of The View</em>, is stirring up a lot of old issues.</p>
<p>From admitting to having had <a href="/videos/elisabeth-hasselbeck-i-prayed-when-i-learned-rosie-odonnell-had/">a crush on Elisabeth Hasselbeck</a> to declaring that <a href="/2019/03/rosie-odonnell-whoopi-goldberg-is-mean-as-hell/">Whoopi Goldberg is mean</a>, Rosie is taking no prisoners.</p>
<p>Now, she is slamming Kelly Ripa as &#8220;mean,&#8221; and compares a remark Kelly once made to Clay Aiken to &#8220;gay-bashing.&#8221;</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s go way back to the incident in question. The year was 2006.</p>
<p><em>Live With Regis And Kelly</em> was a thing, and they were joined by guest host Clay Aiken.</p>
<p>At one point, Clay put his hand over Kelly&#8217;s mouth, and Kelly rebuffed him, jokingly saying: &#8220;I don’t know where that’s been, honey!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell saw that and she went off on it on <em>The View</em> the next day.</p>
<p>Because Clay Aiken had not yet come out as gay to the public, she viewed Kelly&#8217;s words as deeply offensive and even dangerous.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Speaking on <em>The View</em>, Rosie said that Kelly Ripa&#8217;s words were &#8220;a homophobic remark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that was a straight man, if that was a cute man, if that was a guy that she didn’t question his sexuality,&#8221; Rosie claimed. &#8220;She would’ve said a different thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shockingly, Kelly called in and the producers actually put her through to speak to the panelists.</p>
<p>Kelly called Rosie&#8217;s accusations &#8220;downright outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her new book, written by Ramin Setoodeh, Rosie explains why she was so incensed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few days before he went on <em>Live </em>he had been a guest on <em>The View</em>,&#8221; the book notes.</p>
<p>Rosie recalls: “He had come into my dressing room, crying about whether or not to come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I sat down with him and I talked to him,&#8221; Rosie says. &#8220;He was inching his way out in the way so many born-again Southern Christians have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hugged him,&#8221; Rosie describes. &#8220;Not only do I feel the twenty-years-older mother thing, I feel the twenty-years-old younger-gay thing.” </p>
<p>Solidarity within the LGBTQ+ community has kept many people alive in a world that wanted them silent or dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Rosie explains. &#8220;I had just held a crying boy and then watched him be gay bashed by Kelly Ripa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gay bash refers to, very specifically, violent attacks against people who are or are perceived to be LGBTQ+ and usually men believed to be gay or bi.</p>
<p>This can come from associates, neighbors, or family, but also from total strangers who are looking to ruin someone&#8217;s life &#8212; or end it.</p>
<p>Even if Kelly&#8217;s remark were homophobic, it should not be compared to gay-bashing.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the show, Rosie heard from Aiken,&#8221; the book details. &#8220;First, she said that he thanked her for defending him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clay apparently said to her: &#8220;I didn’t know how to come out, so you just did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clay also gave his account of the events in Rosie&#8217;s book, and he was pretty up-front about remembering things differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a horrible memory, but I know exactly how this s&#8211;t went down,” Clay says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aiken said he’d been worried about his interview on <em>The View</em>,&#8221; the book mentions.</p>
<p>He was nervous &#8220;because a prominent news anchor had warned him the cohosts might ask him about his sexuality on TV. But that didn’t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, Barbara Walters famously asked Ricky Martin about his sexual orientation. Years later, she cites it as a major regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead,&#8221; the book details. &#8220;Rosie invited Aiken to her dressing room to talk privately before the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clay recalls her &#8220;kicking out her makeup team and his bodyguard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clay says that she told him: ‘You need to find yourself a boyfriend in North Carolina &#8212; not in New York or Los Angeles &#8212; and just live peacefully there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re very presumptuous, Rosie,&#8221; Clay responded, because he was still not &#8220;out.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, Rosie knew that he was gay because, you know, she could just tell. Many considered it an open secret at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;She took my hand, looked me dead in the eye,&#8221; he describes.</p>
<p>Clay narrates: &#8220;And with more warmth than I think people would imagine she has, she said, ‘Listen, I’m your sister.’&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I teared up,&#8221; Clay admits. &#8220;It was the very first time a stranger had ever gotten me to come out to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, he notes that when she called out Kelly&#8217;s remark as homophobic just days later, he fell to pieces.</p>
<p>Why? Because he felt like Rosie had just outed him in front of the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the worst day of my life,&#8221; Clay admits, but clarifies that he was not angry with Rosie over it.</p>

<p>But Rosie says that the fallout from Kelly Ripa endures to this very day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Kelly Ripa is mean and she doesn’t like me, and she has never wanted to discuss what happened,&#8221; Rosie accuses in her book.</p>
<p>Rosie adds: &#8220;She wanted to have this weird feud.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clarifies that, like so many of us who were watching television in the &#8217;90s, Rosie has fond memories of Kelly from her role on <em>All My Children</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see her at concerts sometimes,&#8221; Rosie notes. &#8220;She just looks away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosie admits to being angry about the producer buzzing Kelly into the conversation on <em>The View</em> in the first place.</p>
<p>She says that she warned him that if it happened again, she would quit. She says that she ultimately quit because it happened again.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So, real talk? Here&#8217;s our breakdown of this whole dang mess.</p>
<p>One, we know that it was 2006, but Clay should not have put his hand over Kelly&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a gay thing or even a #MeToo thing in this case, it&#8217;s just inappropriate in all realistic situations.</p>
<p>Two, Kelly&#8217;s remark has nothing to do with anybody&#8217;s orientation.</p>
<p>My grandmother&#8217;s mother would say that men should never be allowed to do dishes, because &#8220;you don&#8217;t know where their hands have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly <em>one </em>way of explaining to children why so much household labor is done by only one gender &#8230; we suppose.</p>

<p>It is clear that Rosie felt extremely protective of Clay because he was obviously gay yet clearly struggling to come out.</p>
<p>This was an issue for him on a personal level and on a professional one. He was worried about his life and career.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in Rosie&#8217;s concern, she accidentally helped out him &#8212; which should never happen.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if Rosie and Kelly could lay their feud to rest, but &#8230;  we won&#8217;t hold our breath.</p>
<p>That feud is so old that it will become a teenager this year. It could last for decades to come.</p>
