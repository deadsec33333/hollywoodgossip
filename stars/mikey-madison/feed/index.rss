<p>Last night, Mikey hosted SNL for the first time. Needless to say, this is definitely an exciting time in her career!</p>



<p>As the reaches one major milestone after another, get to know more about Mikey here!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-began-acting-as-a-teen">Mikey Madison Began Acting As a Teen</h2>



<p>Born in Los Angeles in 1999, Mikey began appearing in short films when she was a teenager. Her first handful of roles were in short films, including 2013&#8217;s <em>Retirement </em>and <em>Pani&#8217;s Box</em>.</p>



<p>Her first feature length film was <em>Liza, Liza, Skies are Grey, </em>which was released in 2017. In 2016, she was cast in a starring role in the dramedy <em>Better Things</em>. She played creator and star Pamela Adlon&#8217;s teen daughter Max.</p>



<p>Prior to her hit role in <em>Anora</em>, she appeared in other major films like <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>, <em>The Addams Family</em>, and <em>Scream</em>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anora-is-her-breakout-role">&#8216;Anora&#8217; Is Her Breakout Role</h2>



<p>In 2024, Mikey became a major star when she portrayed the titular sex worker in <em>Anora</em>. Writer-director Sean Baker had written the part specifically for the actress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-was-a-horseback-rider-before-she-was-an-actress">Mikey Madison Was A Horseback Rider Before She Was an Actress</h2>



<p>Before devoting herself to acting full-time, Mikey had a very intense career path: horseback riding. Her family is made up of dedicated equestrians and cowboys, according to a January 2025 profile in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mikey-madison-anora-lady-in-the-lake-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Cut</em>.</a></p>



<p>While she&#8217;s no longer a competitive horseback rider, the <em>Better Things </em>star has retained an interest in horses. Early in that profile, the writer notes that she was perusing horses available for adoption.</p>



<p>She admitted that it was &#8220;painful&#8221; to give up riding to pursue acting. &#8220;I loved the ritual of getting to the barn and taking care of my horse, but it’s kind of an isolating sport,” she told the outlet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-has-a-twin-brother">She Has A Twin Brother</h2>



<p>Mikey has four siblings, including one twin brother. It&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s very close with her twin, and she&#8217;s referenced him in a few interviews.</p>



<p>She mentioned wanting to collaborate with her brother on a few future projects in the above-mentioned <em>Cut </em>interview. &#8220;I have a couple of personal stories that I’d love to work with my twin brother on,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Additionally, she mentioned that she spoke with her brother after finding out about her Oscar nomination in a <em><a href="https://variety.com/lists/oscars-nomination-reactions-ariana-grandes-demi-moore-mikey-madison/mikey-madison-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> </em>interview. &#8220;I was on FaceTime with my mom, my dad, my dog and my twin brother this morning, and I’m humbled; absolutely overjoyed,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s clear that they&#8217;re very close now, Mikey admitted that back when they were growing up there was some distance between her and her twin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My twin brother would pretend that we weren&#8217;t siblings, people would be like on the last day of school &#8216;Miles why would you be getting into [Mikey&#8217;s] car with her?&#8217; and he was like, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s my sister,'&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGoTBupUZT8&amp;pp=ygUPdyBtaWtleSBtYWRpc29u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W</a>.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;He has since apologized,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-is-a-proud-dog-amp-cat-mom">Mikey Madison Is a Proud Dog &amp; Cat Mom</h2>



<p>Given her background in horseback riding, it should come as no surprise to learn that Mikey has a soft spot for animals. She gushed about both of her pets in an August 2024 <em><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61777335/mikey-madison-interview-2024/">Esquire</a> </em>profile.</p>



<p>Her pets have cute names that go hand-in-hand with each other. &#8220;His name is Jam, because I have a cat named Biscuit,&#8221; she told the magazine. Adorable! </p>

<p>Demi Moore losing the Oscar <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Mikey Madison</a>, an actress in her 20s, felt a <em>little </em>on the nose.</p>



<p>But that is what happened. The Best Actress award at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2025 Academy Awards</a> went to the lead from <em>Anora</em>, not the lead to <em>The Substance</em>.</p>



<p>Frankly, it just felt like a continuation of <em>The Substance</em>. Thematically, anyway.</p>



<p>At the moment of the announcement, Demi Moore appeared to say something. What was it?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Demi Moore on March 2, 2025 attending the Academy Awards." class="wp-image-520518" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-beat-demi-moore-for-the-coveted-best-actress-oscar">Mikey Madison beat Demi Moore for the coveted Best Actress Oscar</h2>



<p>The reactions to Demi Moore losing the Oscar and Mikey Madison winning it have nothing to do with Madison or her acting. She&#8217;s excellent and she deserves her flowers.</p>



<p>Even her big fans are balancing excitement for her with an acknowledgment that Moore has received too little recognition for her phenomenal career.</p>



<p>However, many can only imagine how Moore is feeling. <em>The Substance</em> is, after all, about the intersection of ageism and misogyny in the entertainment industry. Now, she&#8217;s not even winning an Oscar for it.</p>

<p>At the moment of the announcement that Mikey Madison had won the Best Actress Oscar for <em>Anora</em>, Demi Moore appeared to say something. But what?</p>



<p>According to a lip reader for <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14454501/Demi-Moore-shock-snub-Oscars-lip-reader-reveals-reaction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, what the legendary actress said may have been a <em>bit </em>sarcastic.</p>



<p>“Demi says ‘nice,’ but she isn’t smiling when she says it,” claimed Nicola Hickling. “Her body is almost nodding like she had to force herself to say it.”</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/demi-moore-full-frontal-nude-the-substance-cannes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Substance</a></em> is a body horror film that follows Demi Moore&#8217;s character, an aging actress, whose career has dried up. </p>



<p>Out of desperation, she uses a black market drug (the titular substance) to create a younger copy of herself, but the two soon grow to resent each other. The results are catastrophic.</p>



<p>The film&#8217;s commentary on ageism in the entertainment industry is not subtle. At all. Watching her lose the Oscar was hard for many people. But that Demi Moore lost to 25-year-old Mikey Madison felt a little <em>pointed</em>.</p>

<p>Did Demi Moore lose because of ageism? Did she lose because of the pernicious intersection of ageism and misogyny that is only magnified in the entertainment industry?</p>



<p>Not <em>necessarily</em>. But these are factors that we cannot casually disregard.</p>



<p>Remember, even the most unhinged Oscars voters (folks, many of these people are absurd) likely aren&#8217;t going, &#8220;well, I&#8217;m not voting for a woman in her 60s.&#8221; Most bias of this form takes place in the unconscious.</p>

<p>Mikey Madison thanked the production company behind <em>Anora </em>and thanked Sean Baker, the director. Then, she delved into an important message related to her Oscar-winning film.</p>



<p>“I just want to recognize and honor the sex&nbsp;worker community,&#8221; she emphasized. (As it happens, the Oscars took place the night before <a href="https://www.nswp.org/event/international-sex-worker-rights-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Sex Worker Rights Day</a>)</p>



<p>“Yes, I will continue to support and&nbsp;be an ally,&#8221; Madison affirmed. &#8220;All of the incredible people,&nbsp;the women that I’ve had the&nbsp;privilege of meeting from that&nbsp;community has been one of the&nbsp;highlights of this incredible&nbsp;experience.”</p>
