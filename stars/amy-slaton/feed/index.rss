<p>We hope you&#8217;re sitting down, 1000-lb Sisters fans.</p>



<p>You may soon need a drink of water, as well.</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, TLC released the first <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/1000-lb-sisters-season-7-trailer-the-camel-bite-the-arrest-the-intervention/">trailer for Season 7</a> of this popular reality show, revealing when the series will return and also previewing how it will take viewers behind the scenes of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">Amy Slaton&#8217;s arrest last fall</a>.</p>



<p>But there are two central plot points the preview apparently ignored.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-960x540.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net_.jpg 1274w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton doesn&#8217;t look excited about this kiss, does she?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meaning what, exactly?</p>



<p>“I’m getting married to a girl!” Tammy Slaton said during an appearance on the YouTube show LOLCowLive earlier this month.</p>



<p>She went on to say &#8220;my fiancée has not got kids, but she’s got a cat&#8221; and did not offer any other details on this individual.</p>



<p>The reality star <em>did</em> previously say that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/tammy-slaton-hey-ladies-i-wanna-be-a-lesbian-now/">she was now a lesbian</a>,</p>



<p>“Lately I’ve been feeling like it’s time for me to start moving on and to start seeking love again, but this time I’m thinking of seeing a female,” Tammy told viewers on a Season 6 installment of 1000-lb Sisters, adding on air:</p>



<p>“As it stands right now, I don’t want to be with another man. It just doesn’t feel right. I don’t even have those feelings for a guy anymore after Caleb passed.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522523" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-960x540.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/https___prod.static9.net-1.jpg 1274w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tammy Slaton has lost so much weight. We&#8217;re seriously in awe.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That last sentence, of course, is a reference to Tammy&#8217;s husband, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/caleb-willingham-tammy-slatons-estranged-husband-dead-at-41/">passed away in the summer</a> of 2023.</p>



<p>“He was my best friend and I loved him dearly,” she told People Magazine of Caleb Willingham, adding back then:</p>



<p>“When I met Caleb he became my guardian angel and now he really is watching over me.”</p>



<p>Has Tammy actually found a way to move on? Is she actually with the person she plans to spend the rest of her life with?</p>



<p>Some YouTube followers have their doubts because Slaton went on to give the hosts some details about her upcoming wedding&#8230; revealing that she and her future spouse will be exchanging at a haunted former tuberculosis hospital.</p>



<p>“We’re going to Waverly Hills,” Tammy said, citing a sanatorium that closed in 1961, yet is now a museum that plays host to ghost tours due to the property’s high level of paranormal activity.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not making that part up.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="424" height="318" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512679" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa.jpg 424w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy and Tammy Slaton embrace for this TLC promotional poster.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just as we were trying to digest this bombshell, meanwhile, Tammy dropped another.</p>



<p>“Amy’s got a wedding too!” she announced.</p>



<p>With this, the YouTube hosts shifted their attention to Amy Slaton, who actually confirmed she’s getting married, &#8212; and that the wedding will take place on Halloween.</p>



<p>“I’m getting married to a guy!” Amy clarified.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="668" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-1024x668.png" alt="" class="wp-image-515595" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-1024x668.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-300x196.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-768x501.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-960x626.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-1080x705.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton looks VERY unhappy in this photo from 1000-Lb Sisters.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amy shares two kids with ex-husband Michael Halterman, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/amy-slaton-and-michael-halterman-settle-divorce-it-really-is-over/">from whom she split</a> about two and a half years ago.</p>



<p>“There was a lot of things, let’s just say it was abusive and that’s basically all that’s needed to know,” she said awhile back of what happened in that marriage. “[TLC] didn’t show most of it, let’s just say that.”</p>



<p>As for the identity of her groom-to-be, Amy was arrested last year along with Brian Scott Lovvorn&#8230; who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/amy-slaton-pleads-guilty-to-drug-possession-signs-plea-deal/">pleaded guilty in December</a> to one count of simple possession of marijuana and one count of simple possession of mushrooms.</p>



<p>We can only assume this is now her fiance.</p>



<p>Will there be any other surprises when 1000-lb Sisters returns with new episodes on April 16?</p>



<p>“None of us is pregnant!” Tammy assured YouTube viewers during this appearance.</p>

<p>Amy Slaton has arrived at a legal resolution.</p>



<p>On December 19, the 1000-Lb Sisters star pleaded guilty to “simple possession” in a plea deal submitted to the Crockett County courthouse in Tennessee.</p>



<p>This deal stemmed from a September incident during which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">Slaton was arrested in the parking lot</a> of a zoo in this same state.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="668" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-1024x668.png" alt="" class="wp-image-515595" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-1024x668.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-300x196.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-768x501.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-960x626.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton-1080x705.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/amy-slaton.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton looks VERY unhappy in this photo from 1000-Lb Sisters.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to legal documents obtained by Us Weekly and other entertainment news outlets, the 37-year old received a suspended sentence of 11 months and 29 days to time served and therefore <strong>won’t spend any time behind bars</strong>. </p>



<p>Slaton will have to pay a $500 fine and attend an alcohol and drug assessment. </p>



<p>Moreover, the TLC personality cannot have any contact with the Tennessee Safari Park.</p>



<p>Thankfully for the mother of two young kids, the charges of child abuse and child endangerment against Slaton were dropped &#8212; which, we presume, means she is NOT in danger of losing custody of sons Glenn and Gage.</p>



<p>We previously heard <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-under-cps-investigation-will-she-lose-her-kids-in-wake-of-arrest/">Slaton was under investigation</a> for whatever transpired this fall.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-28-at-1.49.52%E2%80%AFPM-1024x765.png" alt="" class="wp-image-512084"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton looks on here in this 1000-Lb Sisters scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Slaton and boyfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slatons-boyfriend-who-the-heck-is-brian-scott-lovvorn/">Brian Scott Lovvorn</a> were taken into custody three months ago after the Crocket County Sheriff’s Department was called about a guest being bit by a camel at the local drive-through zoo.</p>



<p>“Upon arrival, deputies were immediately overtaken by suspicious odors coming from the guest’s vehicle,” the police said in a social media statement at the time.</p>



<p>Slaton, you see, was allegedly bitten by the animal at the zoo and taken to the ER for medical attention before being taken to police headquarters.</p>



<p>When police investigated further, they arrested Slaton on “illegal possession of Schedule I, illegal possession of Schedule VI, and two counts of child endangerment,” per this same official report.</p>

<p>Authorities reportedly discovered psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana in Slaton’s possession while her two children were in the vehicle.</p>



<p>Both Slaton and Lovvorn initially pleaded not guilty to the drug possession and child endangerment charges. Based on Thursday’s filing, though, Slaton has since pleaded guilty to the lesser charge.</p>



<p>Amy, for her part, has not publicly commented on anything related to the arrest, although we&#8217;ve seen her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/amy-slaton-falls-apart-on-1000-lb-sisters-season-6-premiere/">break down on Season 6</a> of her family&#8217;s reality series.</p>



<p>Amid all her legal drama, Slaton did give fans a glimpse at her home life, sharing photos in October of each of her sons dressed in Halloween pajamas. </p>



<p>“2024,” she captioned the cute social media post.</p>

<p>We have an update on one of the wombs featured each week on TLC.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a sentence we really wished we didn&#8217;t have to write.</p>



<p>But you know the Internet these days, don&#8217;t you? And the endless rumor mill that spins around and around&#8230; and then all around again?</p>



<p>It recently set its sights on Amy Slaton.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="424" height="318" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512679" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa.jpg 424w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/p28305375_b_h9_aa-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy and Tammy Slaton embrace for this TLC promotional poster.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amid speculation that her sibling is expecting her third child, Tammy Slaton used her TikTok platform on Monday to end all mindless and, frankly, rude chatter.</p>



<p>“I wish people would stop spreading rumors,” the 1000-Lb Sisters star said in her latest video. “But I’m here to tell you, Amy is not pregnant.”</p>



<p>Amy, as most fans know, is the mother of sons Gage, 4, and Glenn, 2; she split from their dad in early 2023 and her divorce from Michael Halterman was finalized that September.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slatons-boyfriend-who-the-heck-is-brian-scott-lovvorn/">Slaton has since moved on with a boyfriend</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the two are planning to expand Amy&#8217;s family any time soon or anything.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="715" height="659" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x721-241025065859-Screenshot_2024-10-25_095803-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512085" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x721-241025065859-Screenshot_2024-10-25_095803-copy.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x721-241025065859-Screenshot_2024-10-25_095803-copy-300x277.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton should be so proud of all the weight she has lost.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The unfortunate fact of Amy&#8217;s matters these days is that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">she was arrested in September</a> for drug possession and child endangerment at zoo in Tennessee.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not certain where her case stands, but Child Protective Services looked into the incident and there was concern at some point that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-under-cps-investigation-will-she-lose-her-kids-in-wake-of-arrest/">Amy might lose at least temporary custody</a> of her kids.</p>



<p>We somehow doubt she&#8217;s planning to have another one in the near future.</p>



<p>From all Slaton has said about motherhood, and the lack of help she has received from Halterman, she has been understandably overwhelmed for awhile now with two little ones at home.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-28-at-1.49.52%E2%80%AFPM-1024x765.png" alt="" class="wp-image-512084"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton looks on here in this 1000-Lb Sisters scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elsewhere on TikTok this week, Tammy was forced clarified that her sister-in-law Brittany, who is married to Chris Combs, did NOT unexpectedly die. </p>



<p>Simply put, “Brittany did not pass away,” Tammy said in her video of someone who has appeared often on 1000-Lb Sisters ever since the show premiered in 2020.</p>



<p>“I’m so thankful to hear this. Thank you for letting me know I was heartbroken. Glad Brittany is OK,” one user replied yesterday after Tammy posted.</p>



<p>Once again&#8230; the Internet these days, huh?</p>

<p>Amy has not publicly spoken about the aforementioned incident at the zoo, but she recently shared new images of her sons in their Halloween-themed pajamas.</p>



<p>We assume this means they are back living under her roof again.</p>



<p>Slaton was arrested in September “illegal possession of Schedule I, illegal possession of Schedule VI, and two counts of child endangerment.” </p>



<p>A man named Brian Scott Lovvorn, who was also in the vehicle and presumed to be Slaton&#8217;s lover, was arrested on the same charges. </p>



<p>Both he and Slaton reportedly pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

<p>Amy Slaton will grow especially emotional on the October 29 episode of 1000-Lb Sisters.</p>



<p>But not for a reason you might expect.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-28-at-1.49.52%E2%80%AFPM-1024x765.png" alt="" class="wp-image-512084"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton looks on here in this 1000-Lb Sisters scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a sneak peek at this installment of the TLC reality show, which you can <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409119/1000-lb-sisters-amy-slaton-tearfully-reacts-to-milestone-in-weight-loss-journey">watch over at E! News</a>, Slaton goes on a special shopping trip to celebrate her extreme recent weight loss.</p>



<p>“I always wanted a pair of heels, but I was never skinny enough,” Amy says on air. “When you’re fat and blind, your balance is kind of off, so on the ground is more sturdy.”</p>



<p>Indeed, in the past, we&#8217;ve witnessed sibling <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/tammy-slaton-takes-to-the-sky-accomplishes-yet-another-major-milestone/">Tammy accomplish various life milestones</a> that weren&#8217;t previously possible &#8212; all because she has shed hundreds of pounds.</p>



<p>On this episode, it is Amy&#8217;s turn to do the same.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="715" height="659" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x721-241025065859-Screenshot_2024-10-25_095803-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512085" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x721-241025065859-Screenshot_2024-10-25_095803-copy.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x721-241025065859-Screenshot_2024-10-25_095803-copy-300x277.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton should be so proud of all the weight she has lost.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“When you lose weight, you’re not only losing it in your belly, your legs, your boobs, your ass, you’re losing it everywhere, your fingers and feet included,” Amy explains to viewers in this clip. “I never know my shoe size.”</p>



<p>This is the sort of stuff the average individual never has to consider, you know?</p>



<p>While shopping for high heels on this episode, Slaton even breaks down in tears.</p>



<p>“When I try on the skinny heels, it feels awkward,” she says. “It made me feel like a baby cow trying to walk for the first time. I haven’t gotten my sea legs yet.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="555" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x555-241002140130-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.54.29PM.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510587" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x555-241002140130-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.54.29PM.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x555-241002140130-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.54.29PM-300x163.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x555-241002140130-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.54.29PM-768x416.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x555-241002140130-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.54.29PM-960x520.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton is very sad on the sixth season premiere of 1000-Lb Sisters.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The mother of two shares sons Gage Deon Halterman, 4, and Glenn Allen Halterman, 2, with ex-husband Michael Halterman.</p>



<p>She is under <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-under-cps-investigation-will-she-lose-her-kids-in-wake-of-arrest/">investigation by Child Protective Services</a> after getting arrested this summer at a Tennessee zoo and charged with drug possession and child endangerment.</p>



<p>The latest season of 1000-Lb Sisters, however, was filmed long before this incident took place.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t expect any coverage of it to air in 2024.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-03-at-10.01.53%E2%80%AFAM-1024x815.png" alt="Amy Slaton and Tammy Slaton on air" class="wp-image-489447"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton and Tammy Slaton chat it up here on Season 5 of 1000-Lb Sisters.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Going back through time to when this episode was filmed, though, Amy is able to appreciate the small things.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s able to acknowledge just how far she has come.</p>



<p>“It’s registering that I have lost weight, and I’m not going to break the damn heel,” she tells viewers. “It’s a good moment.”</p>



<p><strong>1000-Lb. Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on TLC.</strong></p>

<p>Amy Slaton is giving fans and followers an unusual glimpse behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Not of her TV show.</p>



<p>But of her actual, real life.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_819x1024-241002140129-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.53.34PM.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510588" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_819x1024-241002140129-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.53.34PM.jpg 819w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_819x1024-241002140129-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.53.34PM-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_819x1024-241002140129-Screenshot_2024-10-02_at_1.53.34PM-768x960.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Slaton is featured here on an episode of her family&#8217;s reality series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On October 16, the 1000-Lb Sisters cast member updated her official Instagram with a photo of her sons; first a snapshot of four-year old son Gage&#8230; followed by an image of two-year old Glenn.</p>



<p>As you can see below, Amy simply wrote &#8220;2024&#8221; as a caption to these adorable photos.</p>



<p>The post marked the first message the TLC star shared since she was arrested for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">drug possession and child endangerment at a Tennessee zoo</a>.</p>



<p>Although it has not yet been confirmed, based on the first charge listed above, it&#8217;s very safe to assume that these same two children were present when Amy was caught on the aforementioned premises with drugs and drug paraphernalia. </p>



<p>According to the local police department’s statement &#8212; posted to Facebook along with Amy and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slatons-boyfriend-who-the-heck-is-brian-scott-lovvorn/">her boyfriend</a>&#8216;s mugshots &#8212; authorities were requested to respond to the local Safari Park where a guest had been allegedly bitten by a camel. </p>

<p>“Upon arrival,” it continued, “deputies were immediately overtaken by suspicious odors coming from the guest’s vehicle.”</p>



<p>The message also noted the following: </p>



<p>“The charges and allegations referenced in this release are merely accusations of criminal conduct and not evidence. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted through due process of law.”</p>



<p>Due to the child endangerment aspect, meanwhile, we&#8217;ve heard that CPS has opened up an investigation.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s at least some chance that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-under-cps-investigation-will-she-lose-her-kids-in-wake-of-arrest/">Amy Slaton could lose custody</a> of her sons.</p>

<p>Amy, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/amy-slaton-and-michael-halterman-settle-divorce-it-really-is-over/">finalized her divorce</a> from the father of Glenn and Gage several months ago, has since confirmed that she and Brian Scott Lovvorn are in a relationship, sharing photos kissing him in a September 30 TikTok and writing:</p>



<p>“Stay at movie dinner movie night with my boo brian.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain whether or not he&#8217;ll make an appearance on 1000-Lb Sisters Season 6 &#8212; but we <em>can</em> confirm that we&#8217;ll find out in the very near future.</p>



<p>The series returned just last week with new episodes!</p>

<p>Amy Slaton is doing her best to move on in the wake of her failed marriage.</p>



<p>Way back in October, the reality star finalized her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/amy-slaton-and-michael-halterman-settle-divorce-it-really-is-over/">divorce from Michael Halterman</a>&#8230; her high school sweetheart, her husband of four years and the father of her two young sons.</p>



<p>Slaton is still living in the house she formerly shared with her ex, however, and dealing with the emotional ramifications when TLC cameras started filming 1000-Lb Sisters Season 6.</p>

<p>“I want to get rid of these couches because they remind me of Michael,” Slaton tearfully tells her sister Amanda in a sneak peek of the upcoming season premiere <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1408115/1000-lb-sisters-amy-slaton-breaks-down-in-tears-over-michael-halterman-split">shared by E!

<p> Adds the mother of two: “I can&#8217;t stand them and I want to get rid of them.”</p>



<p>Amanda responds with words of encouragement, with an attempt to help Amanda push through the pain.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re going to have to make new memories here that shoves the bad ones out,” she tells her sibling. “You don&#8217;t give yourself enough credit. You can do this.”</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Amy opened up about the mental toll everything about the end of her relationship has taken on her.</p>



<p>“I signed the final documents and that’s the end of an era,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/amy-slaton-finalizes-divorce-talks-mental-toll-and-custody-of-young-kids/">Slaton told her YouTube followers</a> as she showed off copies of the divorce papers awhile back, adding simply:</p>



<p>“I’m ready for it to be over with.”</p>



<p>She continued at this time:</p>



<p>“Even though the divorce was shorter than expected, like, less than six months, it took a mental toll on my body and a physical toll on me that I’m seeking help for.</p>



<p>“Michael and me are sharing custody. I get the boys 70% of the time, Michael gets ‘em 30.”</p>

<p>The parent of a three-year old and a two-year old, Amy says on the premiere that she knows she has to take certain steps to feel better about herself.</p>



<p>Even if they&#8217;re just cosmetic for now.</p>



<p>“Right now, I&#8217;m just going to focus on me, my mental health, my physical health, my outer appearance,” she says on air. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to change up the hair color. I just want to get some new hair and get rid of all this excess skin.”</p>



<p>Indeed, the process of skin removal will apparently be a theme on Season 6 &#8212; both for Amy and for her sister, Tammy Slaton.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m just ready to start a new life,&#8221; says Amy, adding that she feels &#8220;like a deflated balloon&#8221; but telling viewers in optimistic fashion:</p>



<p>“Eventually I&#8217;m going to get there. Eventually I&#8217;m going to find a way to love myself.”</p>



<p>This episode was filmed long before <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">Slaton was arrested for child endangerment</a> and drug possession; it&#8217;s unlikely the incident will even be included on new episodes of the series.</p>



<p>After Amy suffered a camel bite at Tennessee Safari Park in Alamo, Tennessee, authorities arrived to treat her &#8230; and allegedly discovered illegal marijuana and mushrooms, leading to them taking her and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slatons-boyfriend-who-the-heck-is-brian-scott-lovvorn/">Brian Scott Lovvorn</a> into custody.</p>

<p>Some new information has emerged about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">Amy Slaton&#8217;s recent arrest</a>.</p>



<p>As previously documented on this celebrity gossip website, the 1000-Lb Sisters star was taken into custody on September 2 amid some rather unusual circumstances:</p>



<p>She was apparently bitten by a camel while at a zoo in Tennessee.</p>



<p>And then when authorities went to check on Slaton, they detected an order in her car &#8230; only to eventually discovered what appeared to be mushrooms and marijuana in the vehicle.</p>

<p>Slaton was arrest on charges of illegal possession of schedule I, illegal possession of schedule VI and two counts of child endangerment, according to a statement from the sheriff’s department.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, however:</p>



<p>Amy wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>



<p>She was in the car with a man named <strong>Brian Scott Lovvorn</strong>, who was arrested on these same exact charges.</p>

<p>We now know, thanks to a People Magazine report, that Slaton was released from jail on a $10,000 bond on the afternoon of September 4&#8230; alongside Brian Scott Lovvorn. </p>



<p>The two were picked up by Amy’s brother Chris Combs, a source told this outlet, and were seen “holding hands” leaving police custody.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all the information we have on Lovvorn at this time.</p>



<p>But it seems evident he and Slaton are dating.</p>

<p>Amy finalized her divorce from Michael Halterman in late 2023 after four years of marriage and two kids:</p>



<p>The exes share four-year old son Gage and two-year old son Glenn; at the moment, Amy has the children 70% of the time.</p>



<p>HOWEVER, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-under-cps-investigation-will-she-lose-her-kids-in-wake-of-arrest/">Child Protective Services has opened</a> up an investigation because two unnamed kids (strongly presumed to be Amy&#8217;s own) were present at the time of this reality star&#8217;s arrest.</p>



<p>Hence the child endangerment charges.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say anything for certain, but there&#8217;s at least some possibility that Slaton loses at least some custody of her sons.</p>

<p>Stephen Sutton, a spokesperson with the Crockett County Sheriff’s Department, said this past Tuesday that Slaton received onsite medical attention before being taken into custody. </p>



<p>Also, TMZ published a photograph that depicts Amy being treated on a stretcher by Crockett County EMS officials.</p>



<p>According to Sutton, the aforementioned drugs were in &#8220;plain sight&#8221; once cops searched Amy&#8217;s vehicle, which could explain why no search warrant was necessary prior to this arrest.</p>



<p>&#8220;The charges and allegations referenced in this release are merely accusations of criminal conduct and not evidence,&#8221; the Sheriff&#8217;s Department said in a Facebook post earlier this week. </p>



<p>&#8220;The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted through due process of law.&#8221;</p>

<p>As you have undoubtedly heard about by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/amy-slaton-arrested-for-drug-possession-child-endangerment-at-tennessee-zoo/">Amy Slaton was arrested this week</a>.</p>



<p>The 1000-Lb Sisters star was taken into custody after a rather strange situation:</p>



<p>Slaton was bitten by a camel at a zoo in Tennessee (and was taken away in a stretcher as a result)&#8230; and, in the process of authorities checking up on her afterward, was found to reportedly be in possession of marijuana and mushrooms.</p>



<p>The TLC personality was then booked on charges of illegal possession of Schedule I and Schedule VI substances; along with two counts of child endangerment.</p>

<p>Wrote the local police department on Facebook after the arrest was made:</p>



<p>“The charges and allegations referenced in this release are merely accusations of criminal conduct and not evidence. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted through due process of law.”</p>



<p>While Slaton is likely worried about her legal fate, however, we&#8217;ve also now learned that she may have a reason to be concerned about her <em>personal</em> future as well.</p>



<p>Specifically, and most troublesome for the mother of two, Slaton may lose custody of her kids.</p>

<p>According to Us Weekly, via Public Information Officer Stephen Sutton, Child Protective Services is looking into what transpired with Amy Slaton.</p>



<p>He told this tabloid on September 3 that “a plan <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/1000-lb-sisters-amy-slaton-is-under-investigation-following-arrest/">has been put in motion</a> involving the parents and there is still ongoing investigation as to where the kids will be placed.”</p>



<p>Slaton shares four-year old son Gage and two-year old son Glenn with ex-husband Michael Halterman; at the moment, she has the children 70% of the time.</p>



<p>It remains unclear whether these toddlers were present when their mom was arrested &#8212; but it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that she <strong>has been charged with two counts of child endangerment</strong>.</p>

<p>A man named Brian Scott Lovvorn was in the car with Slaton and has been charged with the same alleged crimes.</p>



<p>“We have these drugs in the car and two people and two kids,” the sheriff’s department said in a statement, seemingly confirming that Gage and Glenn were, indeed, present.</p>



<p>As of Monday night, Slaton and Lavvorn were still in custody and awaiting their bond hearing.</p>



<p>We cannot verify at this time whether her kids are with their dad or who has custody of them at the moment.</p>

<p>Since Halterman filed for divorce in March 2023 after four years of marriage, Slaton has shared details of subsequent relationships with her fans on social media, although we&#8217;ve never heard of this Brian person before.</p>



<p>Last we heard, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/amy-slaton-has-a-boyfriend-but-dont-tell-her-kids-yet/">Slaton was dating someone named Kevin</a>. </p>

<p>Amy Slaton was arrested on some pretty serious charges, but that&#8217;s really only half of the story. </p>



<p>On September 2, the <em>1000-Lb Sisters</em> cast member was arrested at a zoo in Tennessee after police responded to a call about a guest being bit by a camel. </p>



<p>That guest was Amy herself! This story is pretty wild!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amy-slaton-arrested-the-details">Amy Slaton Arrested: The Details</h2>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0">The Crockett County Sheriff’s Department revealed in the hours after her arrest that&nbsp;<em>1,000-Lb. Sisters</em>&nbsp;star, received onsite medical attention before being taken into custody.</p>



<p>They initially were on the scene due to someone, who turned out to be Amy, reportedly being bit by a camel at the zoo.</p>



<p>“Upon arrival, deputies were immediately overtaken by suspicious odors coming from the guest’s vehicle,” the police explained in a subsequent social media statement.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0">They allegedly discovered “what they believed to be mushrooms” and “what they believed to be marijuana” inside Slaton’s vehicle after smelling marijuana in the car and seeing the drugs out “in plain sight,” according to Stephen Sutton, a public information officer with the sheriff’s department that spoke to People Magazine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-charges-against-amy">The Charges Against Amy</h2>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0"><br>Slaton, 36, and Brian Scott Lovvorn were both arrested and face charges of illegal possession of schedule I, illegal possession of schedule VI and two counts of child endangerment, according to a statement from the sheriff’s department.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">According to TMZ and other outlets, it&#8217;s unclear at this time what promoted the child endangerment charges. However, the Crockett County official shared that Slaton’s two children were placed in the custody of family members, following Amy&#8217;s arrest. They added that the Tennessee Department of Child Services will now investigate their parenting situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;The charges and allegations referenced in this release are merely accusations of criminal conduct and not evidence,&#8221; the Sheriff&#8217;s Department added in its Facebook post. </p>



<p>&#8220;The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted through due process of law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along with her sibling Tammy, Slaton has starred on <em>1000-Lb Sisters </em>&#8212; which documents the ups and downs of the pair’s respective weight loss journeys &#8212; since its premiere in 2020.</p>



<p>She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/amy-slaton-finalizes-divorce-talks-mental-toll-and-custody-of-young-kids/">finalized her divorce from husband Michael</a> earlier this year, several months after the couple separated; they share two young sons, Gage Deon, 4, and Glenn Allen, 2.</p>



<p>“Even though the divorce was shorter than expected, like, less than six months, it took a mental toll on my body and a physical toll on me that I’m seeking help for,” Amy said on a Season 5 episode of her TLC reality show, touching on the process of ending her union.</p>



<p>She previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/amy-slaton-cites-mental-abuse-as-basis-for-divorce-details-final-fight-with-michael-halterman/">alleged &#8220;mental abuse&#8221; against</a> her former spouse.</p>

<p>Amy and Michael were high school sweethearts and got married in 2019.</p>



<p>Their marriage ended in ugly fashion, unfortunately, as Michael took out a restraining order against his ex at one point.</p>



<p>In this filing, Michael requested that he and Amy be prevented from making “any public statements or social media postings concerning this litigation or one another.” </p>



<p>He also asked that he and Amy enter a “shared parenting schedule.”</p>



<p>In the end, Amy was awarded 70% of custody of her two kids&#8230; while Michael gets to spend 30% of the year with them.</p>

<p>While talking about parenthood following her son Glenn&#8217;s birth during a 2023 episode of the hit TLC reality program, Slaton said the following: </p>



<p>&#8220;My heart is full.</p>



<p>&#8220;Being a mom is what I&#8217;ve wanted to do since I was 5 years old and I&#8217;ve always wanted two kids. Our family is finally complete. We can put us in a frame and hang us on the wall now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy Slaton has moved on from her ex-husband with a new boyfriend. </p>



<p>Again.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the <em>1000-Lb Sisters</em> star went social media official with a man named Kevin, revealing him to be her new boyfriend.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re keeping track, it was just a couple months she was hyping up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/amy-slaton-breaks-silence-on-exciting-new-romance-the-sparks-just-flew/">the sparks that flew</a> between her and a different former lover.</p>



<p>Times they are changing!</p>

<p>Now that followers are aware that Slaton has a new lover in her life, many have been wondering when/if Amy will introduce Kevin to her young sons, Gage and Glenn.</p>



<p>“Me and him talked about it,&#8221; Amy responded on February 25 to this inquiry, adding of this boyfriend: </p>



<p>&#8220;He has three kids of his own. We talked about it, and first things first, he’s gonna meet Michael. You gotta meet my kids’ daddy first and build that bond, and then maybe in a year.”</p>



<p>Sounds like Slaton has given this a great deal of thought, as she really ought to, of course.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amy-s-messy-divorce">Amy&#8217;s Messy Divorce </h2>



<p>Amy and Michael Halterman were high school sweethearts who were married for about four years before splitting up in 2023.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/amy-slaton-finalizes-divorce-talks-mental-toll-and-custody-of-young-kids/">divorce was finalized in September</a>.</p>



<p>“I signed the final documents and that’s the end of an era,” Amy previously told her YouTube followers of making the break-up official and legal.</p>



<p>“I’m ready for it to be over with.”</p>

<p>Based on what TLC viewers witnessed on Season 4 and 5 of 1000-Lb Sisters, along with what Slaton has said,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/amy-slaton-bawls-over-marriage-trashes-ex-husband-on-1000-lb-sisters/">Michael was simply a deadbeat dad</a> who didn&#8217;t help out at all with the ex-couple&#8217;s kids.</p>



<p>In a confessional on an episode of this series that recently aired, the 36-year old admitted the divorce hadn’t “fully sunk in,” but she was excited to be the “best mom” she could be to Gage and Glenn.</p>



<p>“Even though the divorce was shorter than expected, like, less than six months, it took a mental toll on my body and a physical toll on me that I’m seeking help for,” Amy continued.</p>



<p>“Michael and me are sharing custody. I get the boys 70% of the time, Michael gets ‘em 30.”</p>

<p>Looking ahead, meanwhile, Slaton hopes to learn from both the mistakes of her marriage and also the mistakes in her first relationship <em>after</em> her marriage.</p>



<p>“I know that’s stupid, but with Tony, he moved right on it,” she said via TikTok this week. </p>



<p>“But with Kevin, we’re doing this right. </p>



<p>&#8220;Like, I’m not meeting his kids, and he ain’t meeting my kids for almost a year. But first things first, you got a better trust with Michael, because at the end of the day, they his kids, too.”</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know a whole lot about this Kevin person&#8230; but he shared a series of photos with Amy on February 8 that featured Kane Brown and Katelyn Brown’s track “Thank God” playing in the background, to which Amy commented:</p>



<p>“Our song.”</p>
