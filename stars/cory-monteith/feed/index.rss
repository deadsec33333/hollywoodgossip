										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/heather-morris-lea-michelle-was-a-total-bully-on-the-glee-set/">Lea Michele is no one&#8217;s favorite person</a>, there are times when any recovering <em>Glee </em>fan takes notice.</p>



<p>For all of the things that Lea is, she was in love with the late Cory Monteith when he tragically passed away.</p>



<p>Over the years, she has made various public and private tributes to her former castmate and dearly departed love.</p>



<p>This time, Lea is honoring Cory with a song that she performed on <em>Glee </em>&#8212; with a very special significance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Lea Michele is currently on tour for <em>An Evening With Lea Michele: Life In Music</em>.</p>



<p>While there are a lot of obvious jokes to make at Lea&#8217;s expense, and while she does deserve that, Cory Monteith does not.</p>



<p>On July 20, the first show of her tour included a cover of Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;Make You Feel My Love.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="837" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-837x1024.jpg" alt="Naya Rivear Cory Monteith Lea Michele Glee Concert 2011" class="wp-image-240377" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-837x1024.jpg 837w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-245x300.jpg 245w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-768x939.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-1256x1536.jpg 1256w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-1675x2048.jpg 1675w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-735x899.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-274x335.jpg 274w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-284x347.jpg 284w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-425x520.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-523x640.jpg 523w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-628x768.jpg 628w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-785x960.jpg 785w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/naya-rivear-cory-monteith-lea-michele-glee-concert-2011-883x1080.jpg 883w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many people have done their absolute best to forget anything and everything from <em>Glee</em>.</p>



<p>But we do recall how Rachel Berry, the character whom Lea played for the duration of the series, sang that exact song.</p>



<p>Even on the show, it was a tribute to Finn Hudson &#8230; who was, in turn, played by Cory Monteith. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/0727-Lea-Michele-Tribute-to-Cory-Monteith-in-2022.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s not just any song, either.</p>



<p>At the time, when millions were mourning Cory after his tragic passing, Ryan Murphy approached Lea with a choice.</p>



<p>The creator of Glee invited her to choose which song her character would sing. It was a major decision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Lea Michele snapped a backstage selfie before her talk show interview.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lea and Cory had listened to the song together, multiple times, during their relationship.</p>



<p>The heavy episode was a tribute to Cory, through the lens of being a tribute to Finn.</p>



<p>Understandably, Lea has never personally watched the episode. That makes a lot of sense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Lea has shared tributes like this for years, usually while marking the anniversary of his 2013 passing.</p>



<p>He died of a tragic overdose. He was only 31 years old.</p>



<p>Though Cory&#8217;s career included numerous roles, including <em>Smallville </em>and <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, the world knows him best for his time on <em>Glee</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>The star quarterback-turned-star-Glee-club member, Cory Monteith was the handsome and kind face behind the character of Finn.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Glee&#8217;s target audience was a decidedly younger crowd &#8212; even those of us who were adults at the time knew that.</p>



<p>As a result, the shock to fans was even greater than it would have been for other demographics.</p>



<p>For many viewers, this was the first time that a lead on a show that they were watching had passed away. The grief was real.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Cory is of course not the only member of the cast to die a tragic death.</p>



<p>Naya&#8217;s passing was more recent, and the horror of it was compounded by the fact that she was a mother.</p>



<p>While Mark Salling&#8217;s death received fewer mourners, people do consider it to be part of a &#8220;<em>Glee </em>curse.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Speaking of cursed things related to <em>Glee</em>, Lea is one of those actors with a reputation for &#8230; difficulty.</p>



<p>Former castmates have spoken out &#8212; some breaking a decade of silence or more &#8212; about how toxic, cruel, and racist she was.</p>



<p>Many people do not like Lea. Even so, paying tribute to Cory&#8217;s memory is something that brings us all together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>As you&#8217;ve probably heard by now, Glee actress <a href="/2020/07/naya-rivera-presumed-dead-in-horrible-drowning-accident/">Naya Rivera disappeared</a> while boating with her son at a lake in Southern California on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tragically, <a href="/2020/07/naya-rivera-assumed-dead-by-authorities-search-continues-for-act/">Rivera is now presumed dead</a>, and authorities have shifted the focus of their efforts from rescue to recovery.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The incident triggered a good deal of talk &#8212; much of it wildly insensitive and disrespectful &#8212; about the challenges Rivera had faced off-camera in the years since Glee ended its six-season season run in 2015.</p>
<p>Some took the macabre speculation a step further by suggesting that the entire cast of the popular Fox musical might be in some way &#8220;cursed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, this is absurd, but it&#8217;s a popular enough argument (at one point on Thursday, &#8220;Glee curse&#8221; was a trending topic on Twitter) that it&#8217;s worth addressing, simply so that it can be put to rest once and for all.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Let us begin by saying, yes, a number of tragedies and public misfortunes have befallen the cast of Glee in recent years.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, male lead <a href="/2013/07/cory-monteith-death-celebrities-send-thoughts-prayers-via-twitte/">Cory Monteith passed away</a> at the age of 30.</p>
<p>Monteith had struggled with addiction throughout his life, but had been sober for over a year at the time of his fatal relapse.</p>
<p>The show addressed his passing with an episode about the death of his character, beloved school quarterback Finn.</p>

<p>Out of respect for Monteith and his loved ones, the cause of Finn&#8217;s passing was never mentioned in the episode.</p>
<p>Sadly, the tabloid press was not quite so respectful. </p>
<p>Also bringing out the worst impulses in America&#8217;s media figures was the sad <a href="/2018/02/mark-salling-cause-of-death-revealed/">death of Mark Salling</a>, who played the rebellious Puck on the show.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/01/mark-salling-suicide-glee-stars-crew-members-react/">Salling committed suicide</a> in 2018 at the age of 35.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="686" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-686x1024.jpg" alt="Mark Salling in 2012" class="wp-image-289228" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-686x1024.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-201x300.jpg 201w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-768x1147.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-1029x1536.jpg 1029w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-1371x2048.jpg 1371w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-735x1098.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-224x335.jpg 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-232x347.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-348x520.jpg 348w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-429x640.jpg 429w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-514x768.jpg 514w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-643x960.jpg 643w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-723x1080.jpg 723w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mark-salling-in-2012-scaled.jpg 1714w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the time of his passing, he was facing a lengthy prison sentence on child porn charges.</p>
<p>Some of the show&#8217;s stars met with far less severe misfortunes, such as Lea Michele, who &#8212; just last month &#8212; was branded a &#8220;horrible human being&#8221; by her former co-stars.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s a pretty minor setback compared to what some of her ex-castmates have endured, but the fact remains that Michele &#8212; who is currently eight months pregnant &#8212; might never again work in Hollywood.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Despite all of these unfortunate turns of events, any talk of a &#8220;Glee curse&#8221; is purely asinine.</p>
<p>As Entertainment Weekly <a href="https://ew.com/tv/glee-curse/">points out</a>, Glee was an ensemble show, and thousands of actors appeared on camera over the course of its run.</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s Wikipedia page lists 24 actors in its &#8220;starring&#8221; section.</p>
<p>With a cast that size, it&#8217;s only natural that a handful of actors would meet with tragedy over the course of several years.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, of course, that a TV show with a cast made up largely of adolescents is not your typical work environment.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;child star&#8221; conjures images of young people being broken by intense pressure coming from the very people who should be looking out for their best interests.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason it doesn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise when such environments foster unusually high rates of addiction and mental illness, and it has nothing to do with some supernatural curse.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rivera dated Salling for a time when they were still on the show, and she stated that she adopted some of his bad behaviors &#8212; including heavy drug use &#8212; during their time together.</p>
<p>All teens face pressure to engage in risky behaviors and the problem is only exacerbated when the peers who are influencing them are independently wealthy and largely unsupervised.</p>
<p>So while the idea of a supernatural curse might make for a more compelling headline the truth of the situation is more commonplace and less mysterious.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But the main reason that talk of a Glee curse is so disrespectful is that it turns the grief experienced by these actors&#8217; loved ones into ghost story fodder.</p>
<p>It also suggests that terrible fates are yet to befall the show&#8217;s dozens of other cast members.</p>
<p>Thus, people who are already grieving the loss of a former colleague are forced to imagine thousands fantasizing about their death.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The fact is, Naya Rivera took her 4-year-old son on a boating expedition; they jumped in the water to go swimming, and she never resurfaced.</p>
<p>Stories don&#8217;t get much sadder than that, and Rivera &#8212; a tremendous talent and devoted mother &#8212; deserves to be mourned as an individual cut down in her prime, not as further evidence of some absurd campfire story.</p>
<p>Please keep that in mind when commenting on her passing on social media.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to Naya&#8217;s loved ones during this immensely difficult time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p><a href="/2013/07/cory-monteith-death-celebrities-send-thoughts-prayers-via-twitte/">Cory Monteith&#8217;s death</a> in a Vancouver hotel room will never not be hard. He wasn&#8217;t just an actor with a beautiful voice and a winning smile. He was also a person with people who loved him, and their hearts still ache with how much they miss him.</p>
<p>As she has since the <a href="/2014/07/lea-michele-shares-cory-monteith-photo-heartfelt-message-on-anni/">first anniversary of Cory Monteith&#8217;s passing</a>, Lea Michele honored his memory on social media with a touching photo tribute.</p>
<p>Actually, with <em>two</em>. &#8230;</p>

<p>We first saw Cory Monteith in a no-lines role on <em>Stargate Atlantis</em> and later in a minor speaking role on <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, but he will always be known for his breakout role on <em>Glee</em>.</p>
<p>And as hard as the death of any celebrity can be, the very sudden passing of a young actor on a show that draws millions and millions of teenage and tween fans had a massive emotional impact that rocked the <em>Glee</em> fandom and beyond.</p>
<p>It shocked the world.</p>
<p>But obviously, no one felt Cory&#8217;s tragic death more acutely than Lea Michele.</p>
<p>That the <em>Scream Queens</em> star continues to post tributes to him on the anniversaries of his death as well as his posthumous birthdays speaks to how close their bond was.</p>
<p>And to how inseparable the two are in the minds of their fans.</p>
<p>This year, four years after Cory Monteith&#8217;s tragic passing, Lea Michele shared this photo on Instagram:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Instagram, her heartfelt caption is short and sweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;4 years and it still feels like yesterday.. love you more C.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Twitter, she shared a version of the photo with way more glare, and included the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard to believe it&#8217;s been 4 years&#8230; We miss you C&#8230; love you more.&#8221;</p>
<p>After both lines, she included a heart emoji.</p>
<p>A lot of people, celebrities and otherwise, repost photos and words.</p>
<p>Lea Michele figured that the honoring Cory warranted some originality and a touch of extra effort.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re inclined to agree.</p>

<p><a href="/2013/10/cory-monteith-death-report-confirms-presence-of-heroin-champagne/">Cory Monteith had champagne and heroin</a> in his system when he died.</p>
<p>The medical examiner described the cause of death as &#8220;mixed drug toxicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cory&#8217;d had a history of drug use but also a history of periods of sobriety.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d been to rehab earlier in 2013 before his death.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been speculated that, though long-time users can develop increasingly higher tolerances for familiar drugs, he may have overdosed on a quantity of heroin that he&#8217;d previously believed to be safe.</p>
<p>Tolerance to drugs doesn&#8217;t remain fixed, and if he&#8217;d recently been sober for an extended period, his body might have been less prepared for a dose of that quantity.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no upside to that story, which has now become familiar to a frightening number of people thanks to the opioid epidemic.</p>

<p>But Cory Monteith should be remembered for his talent, his charm.</p>
<p>And, of course, for the way that his work &#8212; on <em>Glee</em> and elsewhere &#8212; touched his fans and made him so very memorable.</p>
<p>Lea Michele will never forget him for precisely who he was.</p>
<p>And she won&#8217;t let fans forget, either.</p>
