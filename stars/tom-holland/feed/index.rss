<p>Are Zendaya and Tom Holland engaged?</p>



<p>In recent months,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/zendaya-pregnant/"> Zendaya has quashed pregnancy rumors</a> and faced odd yet understandable<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/tom-holland-without-zendaya/"> breakup rumors</a>.</p>



<p>Between <em>Dune Part 2</em> and <em>Challengers</em>, she&#8217;s been in the spotlight for most of 2024. Perhaps even more on people&#8217;s minds than she normally is. Which is saying a lot.</p>



<p>Since she and Tom Holland got together, fans have been hoping to hear news of them taking their romance to the next level.</p>



<p>Reports emphasize that the two have discussed taking the next step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, there’s Zendaya addressing the news DIRECTLY!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zendaya and Tom Holland Engaged: The Rumor</strong></h2>



<p>For a pair of A-list actors who also happen to be one of the planet&#8217;s hottest couples, Tom Holland and Zendaya like to keep a lot of things private.</p>



<p>So, if they are engaged, they’re probably keeping things under the radar. But that hasn’t stopped reports popping up claiming they’re all systems go to get hitched!&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to an April 26 report from <em>OK!</em>,<a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/zendaya-wants-wait-marry-boyfriend-tom-holland/"> Zendaya and Tom Holland have discussed</a> taking their longterm romance to the next level with an engagement.</p>



<p>&#8220;They’ve been dating for a long time, years in fact,&#8221; the inside source stated. Tom and Zendaya first became romantically linked in 2017. They only officially went public with their romance in 2021.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the insider added, the gorgeous longtime couple &#8220;moved in together not too long ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the source: &#8220;They have a solid relationship, and Tom would like to make things official.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="716" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-716x1024.jpg" alt="Zendaya stuns on April 16, 2024 at the Los Angeles premiere of Challengers." class="wp-image-498712" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-716x1024.jpg 716w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-210x300.jpg 210w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-768x1098.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-1432x2048.jpg 1432w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-671x960.jpg 671w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-755x1080.jpg 755w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-839x1200.jpg 839w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_01-scaled.jpg 1790w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zendaya attends the premiere of Amazon MGM Studios&#8217; &#8220;Challengers&#8221; at Westwood Village Theater on April 16, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have They Actually Started Wedding Planning?</strong></h2>



<p>A few months after that report came out, a second from <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/zendaya-and-tom-holland-are-discussing-wedding-plans-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Life &amp; Style</em> </a>went so far as to share that the couple were actually planning a wedding! </p>



<p>“Tom and Zendaya are in a very positive place and they’ve been exclusive now for more than five years,” the source, who has known the couple for years, shared with the outlet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They are part of each other’s families at this point and marriage has been part of the conversation for a while.”</p>



<p>As the pair have “some time off before the next <em>Spider-Man</em> gears up,” the insider explained “he’s never going to have a clearer path to formally propose and much more importantly, to plan for his and Zendaya’s wedding.”</p>



<p>That all sounds well and good &#8211; but is it something that Zendaya even wants right now?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tom Holland and Zendaya at the premiere for Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021." class="wp-image-498713" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0426_zendaya_tomholland_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Holland and Zendaya attendsthe Los Angeles premiere of Sony Pictures&#8217; &#8216;Spider-Man: No Way Home&#8217; on December 13, 2021.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zendaya &amp; Her Career</strong></h2>



<p>Back in April, it sounded like the couple were in no real rush to make it down the aisle, especially considering their careers at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;They’re both so young,&#8221; the inside source reasoned to <em>Ok</em>!. &#8220;They have their whole lives ahead of them.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider said of Zendaya: &#8220;and right now she’d rather focus on her career.&#8221; But, to be clear, it&#8217;s not a rejection.</p>



<p>&#8220;Zendaya isn’t saying no,&#8221; the source emphasized of the alleged engagement talk. &#8220;She’s saying let’s wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>That part still remains true, according to the more recent source. There are no plans for the couple to “elope,” and in fact, when the time does come, they want to have a very big celebration.</p>



<p>“Both of their families have been big cheerleaders for this relationship and neither of them want this to change.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zendaya Addresses Engagement Rumors Head On</strong></h2>



<p>As you might’ve guessed, given how long these two have been together, this isn’t the first time rumors of their engagement have sprung up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, Zendaya posted and then deleted a photo featuring a ring. The prominently displayed piece of jewelry had driven fans into a frenzy &#8212; but she clarified that, no, this was not a soft launch of engagement news.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t post anything, you guys,&#8221; Zendaya lamented in a follow-up video on her Instagram Story in September of 2023. &#8220;I posted it for my hat. Like not for the ring on my right hand, you guys, seriously.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then asked her fans: &#8220;You think that&#8217;s how I would drop the news? You think, like, what!&#8221;</p>



<p>In the fans’ defense &#8211; it’s how other stars are starting rumors too! (We’re looking at you, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomez-engaged-benny-blanco/">Selena Gomez</a>!)</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-other-words-zendaya-has-no-plans-on-soft-launching-her-engagement">In other words, Zendaya has no plans on &#8216;soft launching&#8217; her engagement</h2>



<p>If and when the talented <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/zendaya-pays-heart-shattering-tribute-to-euphoria-co-star-angus-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Euphoria </em>star</a> and Tom Holland become engaged &#8212; which of course they do not actually have to do, <em>ever </em>&#8212; maybe they&#8217;ll put out an announcement. Or perhaps they&#8217;ll keep it private.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not really her brand, or Tom&#8217;s, to subtly drop hints and Easter eggs on social media to make fans guess and speculate. </p>



<p>Fans are doing that on their own.</p>

<p>Zendaya pregnant? When she&#8217;s at the top of her game? When she hasn&#8217;t even married boyfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/tom-holland-without-zendaya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland</a> yet?</p>



<p>These are the kinds of wild rumors and stupid questions that have forced the <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/zendaya-pays-heart-shattering-tribute-to-euphoria-co-star-angus-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Euphoria</a></em> star&#8217;s hand. She hasn&#8217;t been given any choice.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/zendaya-met-gala-tom-holland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a> doesn&#8217;t like talking in public about her relationship. She prefers to keep her private life private.</p>



<p>But the beloved actress has had to change her typically quiet tune, following reports that surfaced throughout social media &#8212; and which made Zendaya understandably furious.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zendaya-pregnant-rumors-how-she-responds">Zendaya Pregnant Rumors: How She Responds</h2>



<p>Over the past few years, the rumor mill has churned out plenty of stories about the young star and Emmy winner. As she stands on the precipice of her first Oscar nomination with the movie <em>Challengers</em>, it looks like the mill is starting up again. </p>



<p>Fans and/or trolls, depending on how you look at it, are trying to will into existence Zendaya taking the next step in her person life. Whether it be settling<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/zendaya-tom-holland-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> down with Tom Holland</a>, getting hitched, or the prevailing storyline, getting pregnant.</p>



<p>But Zendaya has been very clear about how she feels about these rumors.  </p>



<p>You see, a pair of of TikTok videos went viral in the summer of 2022 that made it &#8212; <strong>falsely!!!</strong> &#8212; look like the <em>Euphoria</em> actress was expecting a baby with boyfriend Tom Holland. </p>



<p>They did so by incorporating an annoying &#8220;Krissed&#8221; meme, which means the footage featured a look at Zendaya&#8217;s &#8212; <strong>phony!!!!</strong> &#8212; ultrasound&#8230; and then cut to a video of Kris Jenner dancing to “Lady Marmalade,” a pranking trend known as getting, yes, “&#8221;Krissed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hmm, maybe TikTok should be banned? (Kidding! Kidding! Don&#8217;t come for us!)</p>



<p>Despite being in the middle of filming her tennis epic, the pregnancy rumors reached the desk of Zendaya and shockingly, she responded. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zendaya-pleads-stop-making-stuff-up">Zendaya Pleads: Stop &#8216;Making Stuff Up&#8217; </h2>



<p>Despite the aforementioned TikTok videos concluding with an admission that the Zendaya pregnancy rumors were complete BS,  plenty of Zendaya’s fans heard the news secondhand and believed the story to be true.</p>



<p>Hence, the superstar&#8217;s need to clear things up.</p>



<p>&#8220;See now, this is why I stay off Twitter,&#8221; she wrote on her Instagram Story on June 15, 2022. &#8220;Just making stuff up for no reason weekly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway back to filming…<em>Challengers</em>,&#8221; the actress added, citing the romantic drama she&#8217;d been shooting with <em>The Crown</em>&#8216;s Josh O&#8217;Connor and <em>West Side Story</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/mike-faist-dating-girlfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike Faist</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-honestly-though-who-believes-this-crap">Honestly Though &#8211; Who Believes This Crap?!</h2>



<p>The thing about TikTok is that it&#8217;s invited a brand new generation of clickbait to circulate on the web. If one isn&#8217;t careful, one gets tricked into believing just about anything. </p>



<p>One of the aforementioned videos was shared by TikTok user @robairesbussy.</p>



<p>It  includes a photoshopped snapshpt of Zendaya with a baby bump, walking with Holland, and the words, &#8220;WAIT SINCE WHEN WAS ZENDAYA PREGNANT.&#8221;</p>



<p>The caption notes the clip is a &#8220;#joke.&#8221; Not everyone read the caption, though.</p>

<p>Another TikTok video showed the poster pretending to gasp at the image of a sonogram of a fetus about 20 weeks old&#8230; superimposed on a screenshot of an actual Instagram post that Zendaya shared on January 30, which had contained a promo for <em>Euphoria</em>. </p>



<p>You can see where the confusion came in, right?</p>



<p>Zendaya had included the caption, &#8220;I love you. Halfway there [heart emoji].&#8221; </p>



<p>But the TikTok user edited it to look like she tagged Holland, Zendaya&#8217;s Spider-Man co-star; and it also included a text box with the words, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the end of the clip, a dancing Kris Jenner appear, along with the text, &#8220;YOU JUST GOT KRISSED…SEND THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS TO #KRIS THEM!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tom-holland-and-zendaya-s-future-where-do-they-stand">Tom Holland and Zendaya&#8217;s Future: Where Do They Stand? </h2>



<p>Zendaya and Tom met in 2016 while filming <em>Spider Man: Homecoming</em>.</p>



<p>After they denied rumors that their friendship was anything romantic for years, the celebrities were spotted kissing in July 2021.</p>



<p>Still, neither Zendaya nor Holland talk much about the other in the press or on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/zendaya-unfollows-tom-holland-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>. Although the exceptions made are so sweet.</p>



<p>For example, Zendaya loves to wish her British boy a happy birthday via Instagram and Tom is known to show her the same affection time and again. </p>



<p>One things for sure: if these two have something to tell us, they&#8217;ll TELL us. So, don&#8217;t believe everything you watch on TikTok, huh?</p>

<p>Tom Holland is getting slammed. It&#8217;s not for something he did or said, but for <em>not </em>speaking up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/tom-holland-without-zendaya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world loves Tom Holland</a>. And he has repeatedly demonstrated that he&#8217;s a good, lovable person.</p>



<p>At the moment, however, critics say that his silence is <em>deafening</em>.</p>



<p>One of his own castmates is the target of vicious racist hate. Will he speak up to defend her? Or would this do more harm than good?</p>

<p>In early April, The Jamie Lloyd Company put out a statement on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5YSb6bIOey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page to condemn a hate campaign against a <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em> cast member.</p>



<p>&#8220;Following the announcement of our Romeo &amp; Juliet cast, there has been a barrage of deplorable racial abuse online directed towards a member of our company,&#8221; the statement grimly acknowledged. &#8220;This must stop.&#8221;</p>



<p>The theatrical company continued: &#8220;We are working with a remarkable group of artists. We insist that they are free to create work without facing online harassment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the company itself did not identify the victim, unfortunately, it is not mystery. </p>



<p>Francesca Amewudah-Rivers is portraying Juliet in the play. She is a talented Shakespearean actor.</p>



<p>And when Amewudah-Rivers shares posts, hateful and frankly <em>evil </em>comments crop up. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>As always with these kinds of hate campaigns, the goal is to drive people of color (and other targets) out of projects. </p>



<p>And to make companies too afraid to cast them for fear of similar backlash.</p>



<p>Already, even some people claiming to &#8220;support&#8221; Amewudah-Rivers have taken to social media to claim that casting bears &#8220;some responsibility.&#8221; As if it were the wrong thing to do, and one should simply <em>let the terrorists win</em>, so to speak.</p>

<p>Arséma Thomas, who is most recognizable for her role as Lady Agatha Danbury in <em>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</em>, is speaking out on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arsemathomas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page.</p>



<p>She is urging Tom Holland, who plays Romeo in the theatrical production, to speak up in defense of Amewudah-Rivers.</p>



<p>After HBO actor Selina Jones spoke up, Thomas echoed her words, reposting her message to her Instagram Story.</p>

<p>Selina Jones wrote: “You lot need to put pressure pon @tomholland2023’s head top. I need my guy to say something, ANYTHING, about the disgusting racial abuse being thrown at our angel Fran.”</p>



<p>Then, Thomas reposted the message and added her own words, writing: “So bloody true @selinasjones.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tom Holland is a high-profile actor. Though best known for playing Spider-Man in the MCU and for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/zendaya-tom-holland-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being Zendaya&#8217;s hot, lovable boyfriend</a>, he arguably has a decent amount of power as an actor. Could a few words from him make a difference?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tom-holland-speaking-out-might-do-more-harm-than-good">Tom Holland speaking out might do more harm than good</h2>



<p>On social media, some are praising and echoing Thomas&#8217; call to action. In some posts, Tom Holland continues to get slammed for his silence. Others are attempting to slam the brakes &#8212; or, at least, are advising caution.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, through the anonymity of the internet, racists seldom respond well to scolding. </p>



<p>Some have even expressed concern that it could make matters worse. Holland&#8217;s high profile acting career could contribute to a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streisand Effect</a> &#8212; making more racists aware of Amewudah-Rivers and thus painting a larger target on her.</p>

<p>Amewudah-Rivers&#8217; public statements have been positive. As we noted, she is a Shakespearean actor, and this is her West End debut as Juliet.</p>



<p>Perhaps she is ignoring the bigotry and vitriol. But no matter how well she might be coping with the onslaught of hate, she shouldn&#8217;t have to. That&#8217;s not on casting agents (or on Tom Holland), but on the monsters who are attacking her.</p>



<p>This <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet </em>production will run from May 11 until August 3 at London&#8217;s Duke of York Theatre. To say that we hope that the racist attacks die down would be an understatement.</p>

<p>Uh-oh! Tom Holland showed up in public without Zendaya yet again. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/zendaya-tom-holland-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya and Tom Holland breakup fears</a> circulated among fans after multiple solo sightings.</p>



<p>Tom has pushed back on these rumors. But he&#8217;s clearly in no rush to make a show of debunking the claims, either.</p>



<p>The beloved actor went stag to the 2024 Critics Choice Awards over the weekend. But why?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Tom Holland looks handsome at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards." class="wp-image-490368" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_tomholland_01.jpg 1619w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Holland attends the 2024 Critics Choice Awards on January 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Presley Ann/Getty Images for SeeHer)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tom-holland-deserves-all-of-the-awards">Tom Holland deserves all of the awards</h2>



<p>On Sunday, January 14, the Critics Choice Awards took place in Santa Monica.</p>



<p>Tom Holland attended. He was not merely a piece of red carpet eye candy &#8212; he was a nominee, up against the likes of Matt Bomer and Steven Yeun (the latter of whom won).</p>



<p>Though most of us know him best for his high-profile action films, he won widespread acclaim last year for <em>The Crowded Room</em>. Truly a different vibe from his other roles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>As you can see, Tom was his usual charming self on the red carpet. He spoke politely to interviewers, waved handsomely to cameras.</p>



<p>However, he had attended the event alone &#8212; despite weeks of speculation about his relationship status.</p>



<p>Sorry to any fans who had hoped that he and Zendaya would quash breakup rumors with a public red carpet walk. That&#8217;s not how it happened.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-was-zendaya">Where was Zendaya?</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t know Zendaya&#8217;s precise GPS coordinates from Sunday, but she certainly wasn&#8217;t at the Critics Choice Awards.</p>



<p>This wouldn&#8217;t have simply been a public, professional date night. Tom was up for an award after some truly fine acting.</p>



<p>Tom and Zendaya have not made a public appearance together since October (when they went grocery shopping). Sunday could have been a perfect place to shut down breakup speculation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-tom-holland-and-zendaya-broken-up">Are Tom Holland and Zendaya broken up?</h2>



<p>No.</p>



<p>As we reported late last week, Tom has personally shut down breakup reports.</p>



<p>On Friday, he told <em>TMZ</em>&#8216;s reporters that he and Zendaya have &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; broken up. He did not choose to elaborate.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="753" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-753x1024.jpg" alt="Zendaya looks gorgeous as she poses on the red carpet." class="wp-image-490372" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-753x1024.jpg 753w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-221x300.jpg 221w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-768x1045.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-1129x1536.jpg 1129w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-1505x2048.jpg 1505w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-735x1000.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-246x335.jpg 246w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-255x347.jpg 255w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-382x520.jpg 382w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-470x640.jpg 470w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-565x768.jpg 565w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-706x960.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-794x1080.jpg 794w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0115_zendaya_02-scaled.jpg 1882w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zendaya, recipient of the Star of the Year Award, attends the CinemaCon Big Screen Achievement Awards at Omnia Nightclub at Caesars Palace during CinemaCon, the official convention of the National Association of Theatre Owners, on April 27, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-caused-tom-holland-and-zendaya-breakup-rumors">What caused Tom Holland and Zendaya breakup rumors?</h2>



<p>Many couples spend months without going out together in public. Busy schedules sometimes mean that you treasure your time together, and don&#8217;t share it with anyone.</p>



<p>But a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/zendaya-unfollows-tom-holland-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya unfollowed Tom Holland</a> &#8212; along with everyone else &#8212; in a massive Instagram purge.</p>



<p>Zendaya has not explained the move. Most theorize that it is part of a promotional campaign for upcoming projects, including <em>Challengers </em>(which comes out in April).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="CHALLENGERS | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDnVk5jIJr0?start=3&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>But with reports that Tom and Zendaya hung out on New Year&#8217; Eve, and then Tom&#8217;s own statement, it seems clear that the breakup was just &#8230; whatever the opposite of <em>wishful thinking</em> is.</p>



<p>Sometimes, liking a public figure means fearing that they&#8217;re a monster. And sometimes liking a celebrity couple means worrying that they&#8217;ll have an ugly breakup.</p>



<p>Tom and Zendaya make their relationship work because they are careful about what they share with the world. Also because they&#8217;re both gorgeous, wonderful people who love each other.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zendaya-and-tom-holland-are-maintaining-the-balance">Zendaya and Tom Holland are maintaining the balance</h2>



<p>In the past, Zendaya has spoken about how she appreciates fan support &#8212; but that it doesn&#8217;t mean that she&#8217;ll overshare about her romance.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re public figures, their relationship is no secret, but some things are still personal.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t blame these two for keeping things as private as they can. Even when weird rumors circulate.</p>

<p>Did Tom Holland and Zendaya go through a secret breakup?</p>



<p>To start off 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/zendaya-unfollows-tom-holland-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya unfollowed Tom Holland</a> on Instagram as part of a larger social media purge.</p>



<p>That could be anything from a mental health break to a promo strategy to a soft-launch of split news.</p>



<p>Social media aside, these two gorgeous blockbuster stars haven&#8217;t made a public appearance together in <em>months</em>. Is it over?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zendaya-is-no-longer-following-tom-holland-on-instagram">Zendaya is no longer following Tom Holland on Instagram</h2>



<p>Very recently, Zendaya unfollowed Tom Holland. As we reported at the time, he was not the only casualty of her unfollowing spree &#8212; but, as her boyfriend, he is the most notable.</p>



<p>If you look at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zendaya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya&#8217;s Instagram page</a>, you&#8217;ll see that she has about 184 million followers &#8230; and is following absolutely no one.</p>



<p>There are a few explanations for this. But while a <em>mass unfollow</em> doesn&#8217;t always mean a breakup, fans worry that this isn&#8217;t the only sign of a split.</p>

D&#8217;Aprano/Getty Images for Bulgar)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To date, Zendaya has not offered any explanations for her unfollowing spree. </p>



<p>She has made great use of her fame and platform in the past, including <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/zendaya-pays-heart-shattering-tribute-to-euphoria-co-star-angus-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying tribute to late costar Angus Cloud</a> last summer.</p>



<p>Zendaya knows how many eyes are on her and on her social media. She obviously knows how many people would notice her unfollow Tom.</p>

<p>Since her unfollowing spree, Tom Holland hasn&#8217;t said a word about it. </p>



<p>Notably, he is still very much following Zendaya. (Yes, we checked)</p>



<p>This means that not only did Tom not unfollow her (a &#8220;mutual unfollow&#8221;), but Zendaya didn&#8217;t block or even soft-block him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-have-we-last-seen-tom-holland-and-zendaya-together">When have we last seen Tom Holland and Zendaya together?</h2>



<p>Some fans have argued that these two clearly broke up. Others disagree, citing other explanations &#8212; like Zendaya wanting a social media break from weirdos <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/zendaya-issues-rare-statement-fires-back-at-pregnancy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and unfounded rumors</a>.</p>



<p>But this unfollowing is stirring new rumors. And a lack of evidence that she remains with Tom isn&#8217;t helping.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t appear that Tom and Zendaya have appeared in public for <em>months</em>. Their last public photos date back to an October 25 grocery run.</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Zendaya and Tom have been recluses.</p>



<p>Just this week, eyewitnesses spotted Zendaya driving around Los Angeles. She was with a friend &#8212; not Tom.</p>



<p>Later that same day, Tom was in West Hollywood at Members Club. He appeared to be on his own.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-good-news-tom-holland-and-zendaya-definitely-spent-time-together-recently">Good news: Tom Holland and Zendaya definitely spent time together recently</h2>



<p>Despite it being months since their last public appearance, <em>TMZ </em>reports that <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/01/12/zendaya-tom-holland-breakup-split-rumors-relationship-scrutiny-instagram-unfollow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland and Zendaya spent New Year&#8217;s Eve together</a>.</p>



<p>They didn&#8217;t post photos. And no spies snapped pics of them ringing in 2024, either.</p>



<p>But <em>TMZ</em>&#8216;s reporting on these matters is extremely credible. And it makes sense that a notoriously private couple would continue to treasure their privacy.</p>

<p>As <em>TMZ </em>notes, it&#8217;s theoretically possible that Tom and Zendaya broke up in the past, what, week and a half?</p>



<p>But if they did, they haven&#8217;t told close friends. And if they did, Tom hasn&#8217;t even unfollowed his (hypothetical) ex.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s very unlikely that Zendaya&#8217;s unfollowing spree has anything to do with her relationship status whatsoever.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-instagram-unfollows-can-be-a-pr-strategy">Instagram unfollows can be a PR strategy</h2>



<p>As for the Instagram shenanigans, Zendaya has spoken in the past about taking social media breaks.</p>



<p>This, however, feels more like a promotional strategy.</p>



<p>Zendaya has <em>Dune: Part Two</em> and <em>Challengers </em>coming out this year (two of my most anticipated films of 2024, truth be told). And a mass unfollow is a solid way of silently attracting attention.</p>

<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s possible that Zendaya and Tom Holland broke up. It would be sad, mostly for them, but it does happen.</p>



<p>But at present, the actual evidence doesn&#8217;t suggest that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a reasonably safe guess that this gorgeous couple remains together. Good for them!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-update-on-tom-holland-and-zendaya-s-relationship-status">UPDATE on Tom Holland and Zendaya&#8217;s relationship status!</h2>



<p>On Friday, January 12, just hours after we shared this, the <em>Spider-Man</em> actor issued a public statement.</p>



<p><em>TMZ</em>&#8216;s reporters caught up with him to ask <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/01/12/tom-holland-denies-breakup-rumors-zendaya-unfollow-distance/?adid=social-tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland if he and Zendaya had broken up</a>, to which he replied: &#8220;No, absolutely not.&#8221;</p>



<p>The only way that this answer would not settle matters would be if Zendaya made a statement claiming that they were over. Which is looking <em>extremely </em>unlikely, for so many reasons.</p>

<p>Why did Zendaya unfollow Tom Holland?</p>



<p>The <em>Dune </em>star and her <em>Spider-Man</em> co-star have kept much of their relationship private, but they haven&#8217;t <em>hidden </em>it either. And <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/zendaya-issues-rare-statement-fires-back-at-pregnancy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya has fired back at rumors</a> to defend her romance.</p>



<p>But the beloved Brit no longer appears on her list of Instagram follows. A public unfollow is usually a pretty big deal.</p>



<p>And Tom isn&#8217;t the only one missing from the list. Zendaya&#8217;s fans have <em>questions</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="793" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-1024x793.jpg" alt="Tom Holland wears glasses and Zendaya wears an eye-popping dress." class="wp-image-489581" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-300x232.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-768x595.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-1536x1189.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-2048x1586.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-735x569.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-335x259.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-347x269.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-520x403.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-640x496.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-960x743.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_tomholland_01-1080x836.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Holland and Zendays pose at the after party for the premiere of Sony Pictures&#8217; &#8220;Spider-Man: Far From Home&#8221; on June 26, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This week, Zendaya unfollowed Tom Holland on Instagram. We didn&#8217;t just hear a rumor &#8212; we checked it out ourselves and confirmed it.</p>



<p>The beloved MCU <em>twunk </em>isn&#8217;t the only Instagram account to receive the axe, but he&#8217;s certainly the most eyebrow-raising of the bunch.</p>



<p>Notably, Tom continues to follow Zendaya. So, good news! That means that she didn&#8217;t block him or even soft-block him. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Zendaya wears a jaw-dropping off-the-shoulder black dress." class="wp-image-489582" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zendaya attends the &#8220;Bulgari Mediterranea High Jewelry&#8221; event at Palazzo Ducale on May 16, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images for Bulgari)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>What makes this a little less of a five-alarm fire for their relationship is the total scope of her unfollowing spree.</p>



<p>Zendaya is not, as of January 4, following even a single person. Not friends, not family, not her boyfriend, and not even anyone&#8217;s secret private accounts (unless she&#8217;s following them on her own private account).</p>



<p>Tom is following over 300 accounts. And, as we mentioned, one of them continues to be Zendaya.</p>

<p>Even though Zendaya did not explain her drastic purge, many fans are already making guesses.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re just a few months out from her hotly anticipated film, <em>Challengers</em>. And she&#8217;s of course in promo mode for the toxic-tennis-throuple flick.</p>



<p>Here, we have included the trailer for the April 26th film. I&#8217;d say that this will be my <em>Saltburn</em>, but <em>Saltburn </em>was also my <em>Saltburn</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Simply put, Zendaya&#8217;s public Instagram is a promotional tool for her professional life. And she has previously spoken about how she does &#8212; and does not &#8212; use it.</p>



<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://people.com/beauty/zendaya-on-importance-of-taking-time-away-from-social-media/">Zendaya spoke about social media</a> to <em>People</em>. At the time, she explained how it impacts her mental health.</p>



<p>&#8220;Being on [social media] would kind of make me anxious, or I would start to overthink a little too much,&#8221; Zenday aexplained. &#8220;[My fans] want me to &#8230; be happy and exist beyond social media.&#8221;</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18">Because of this, Zendaya takes mental health breaks from social media.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18">&#8220;Take the time that you need,&#8221; she suggested to her fans.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18">&#8220;And,&#8221; Zendaya then continued, &#8220;don&#8217;t compare yourself to anyone else.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-682x1024.jpg" alt="Zendaya poses on teh red carpet while wearing an intriguing lime green and black top." class="wp-image-489587" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_03-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zendaya attends the 54th NAACP Image Awards at Pasadena Civic Auditorium on February 25, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-20">Obviously, she knows that fans will see that she is no longer following Tom Holland. And she knows that this will create a stir.</p>



<p>For most people, however, the moment that they see that she is no longer following <em>anyone</em>, their minds will be at ease.</p>



<p>Yes, a mass-unfollow would be a great <em>cover story </em>for a breakup that you don&#8217;t want to make public yet. But that seems like a very unlikely explanation in this case.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-22">Truth be told, Tom and Zendaya&#8217;s real-life romance (however guarded) has displayed more affection than their scripted relationship in the MCU-adjacent <em>Spider-Man</em> films.</p>



<p>Sony and Marvel appear reluctant to truly center Tom Holland&#8217;s Peter Parker in Spider-Man movies, forcing him to team up with surrogate father figures with ties to the broader MCU. </p>



<p>As a result, a lot of defining aspects of Spider-Man&#8217;s life and of Peter&#8217;s love life with MJ have fallen by the wayside. All so that we get more screentime of stern flying men with goatees, apparently.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="811" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-811x1024.jpg" alt="Zendaya turns and poses with her head over her shoulder while wearing a tantalizing ensemble." class="wp-image-489589" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-811x1024.jpg 811w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-238x300.jpg 238w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-768x969.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-1217x1536.jpg 1217w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-1622x2048.jpg 1622w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-735x928.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-265x335.jpg 265w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-275x347.jpg 275w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-412x520.jpg 412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-507x640.jpg 507w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-608x768.jpg 608w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-761x960.jpg 761w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-856x1080.jpg 856w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0104_zendaya_04-scaled.jpg 2028w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zendaya poses for photos as she promotes the upcoming film &#8220;Dune: Part Two&#8221; during the Warner Bros.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-27">However, Zendaya and Tom&#8217;s very real interactions have made them one of the entertainment industry&#8217;s most beloved young couples.</p>



<p>In particular, Tom always seems happy to loudly gush on social media about how gorgeous, talented, and radiant Zendaya is.</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t invite cameras into their private lives &#8230; but he has repeatedly let people know just how much he adores her.</p>

<p>It is a wise decision to limit how much of her love life she shares.</p>



<p>And Zendaya is equally wise in taking mental health breaks from social media, even if she leaves her account up ahead of a new film.</p>



<p>Besides &#8230; if people flock to her Instagram to confirm that she&#8217;s unfollowed everyone, they&#8217;ll also see her <em>Challengers </em>promo posts. That can&#8217;t be a <em>bad </em>thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As previously announced,&nbsp;<a href="/2015/06/marvel-announces-new-spider-man-star/">Tom Holland has been cast</a> as Marvel&#8217;s new Spider-Man.</p>
<p>And we know what everyone is now thinking: They&#8217;re coming out with ANOTHER Spider-Man?!?</p>
<p>Also: Who the heck is Tom Holland?!?</p>
<p>The 19-year old British actor is likely best known for having played the son of Naomi Watts in The Impossible, an emotional film that chronicled a family&rsquo;s journey after getting caught in the tsunami that hit Thailand in 2004.</p>
<p>But Holland actually got his start as a dancer in Billy Elliott, initially as a supporting player and then as the title character himself.</p>
<p>Take a look back at a young Holland in the above video and learn more about him from those who worked with the actor on Billy Elliott.</p>
<p>(Also, see him dance!)</p>
