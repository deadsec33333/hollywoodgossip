<p>Welp.</p>



<p>Gwyneth Paltrow just went there.</p>



<p>The Oscar-winning actress used her “Call Her Daddy” podcast appearance to spill some VERY personal tea on two VERY famous ex-boyfriends:</p>



<p>Ben Affleck and Brad Pitt.</p>

<p>“They were both good kissers,” the 52-year-old said when the topic turned to these past lovers&#8230; but host Alex Cooper wanted to learn more.</p>



<p>She asked Paltrow “who was better in bed,” and Paltrow actually answered!</p>



<p>Kind of. Sort of.</p>



<p>To at least <em>some</em> extent.</p>

<p> “That is really hard,&#8221; Paltrow responded, prior to delivering the following revealing response: </p>



<p>&#8220;Brad was, like, the sort of major chemistry, love of your life, kind of, at the time. And then Ben was, like, technically excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Interesting, right? Paltrow appears to be saying that Pitt wins in the passion department, but Affleck comes out on top in terms of technique.</p>



<p>&#8221; I can’t believe my daughter is listening to this! … Am I blushing?” Paltrow added on the podcast.</p>

<p>Paltrow and Pitt met on the set of Se7en in 1994 and got engaged in 1996.</p>



<p>After that relationship ended, the star moved on with Affleck, with whom she was romantically linked from 1997 to 2000.</p>



<p>“I’m not sure I would characterize either of them as high maintenance. … I’m not sure [who cared more about their appearance],&#8221; Paltrow also said on Tuesday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like neither of them are very vain like that. I’m not attracted to guys who are, like, looking at the mirror the whole time. </p>



<p>&#8220;Although, Ben did have, like, a mirror face that he would throw at the mirror. He had a funny mirror face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paltrow also struggled when asked who was better at his job.</p>



<p>“They’re both so talented. I feel like Ben is a great writer and director, but, I guess, I would probably have to say acting along Brad,” Paltrow responded. </p>



<p>“If you think of all the really different roles he’s done&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben is great too, they’re both great.”</p>

<p>Chris Martin knew the sting of a divorce long before<em> whatever&#8217;s</em> going on with him at the moment.</p>



<p>Because it is all very confusing, we know!</p>



<p>In early 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/chris-martin-dakota-johnson-engaged-after-6-years-of-dating-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson&#8217;s engagement</a> became public knowledge. This followed years of secrecy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="790" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-790x1024.jpg" alt="Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow in January of 2014." class="wp-image-507334" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-790x1024.jpg 790w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-232x300.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-768x995.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-1581x2048.jpg 1581w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-741x960.jpg 741w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-834x1080.jpg 834w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-926x1200.jpg 926w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0816_chrismartin_gwynethpaltrow_01-scaled.jpg 1976w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow attend Hollywood Stands Up To Cancer Event on Tuesday, January 28, 2014.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Entertainment Industry Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not even six months later, news broke that the pair had split after seven years together &#8212; only for a competing report to drop hours later insisting they were still together!</p>



<p>So, what is the truth here? Are they together or not? If not, is this a breakup or a divorce? Are we in the middle of an uncoupling sequel or just a miscommunication? </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive in. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chris-martin-s-divorce-from-gwyneth-paltrow-a-decade-of-love">Chris Martin&#8217;s Divorce From  Gwyneth Paltrow: A Decade of Love</h2>



<p>To really understand the Coldplay<em> </em>frontman&#8217;s current relationship status, it&#8217;s important to remember how we got here.</p>



<p>While he reportedly had a previous relationship with events producer Lily Sobhani, Chris Martin&#8217;s most famous relationship was and remains with Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>



<p>Paltrow and Martin met in October of 2002. This was backstage at a Coldplay concert.</p>



<p>One year later, their house-hunting in North London inspired wedding rumors. Things had evidently become serious, and <em>quickly</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wedding-bells-babies-and-then-divorce">Wedding Bells, Babies &#8211; And Then Divorce</h2>



<p>Soon after, in December of 2003, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin confirmed that they were expecting their first child as a couple. </p>



<p>Two days later, on December 5, the two secretly married in Santa Barbara. The hush-hush ceremony was so small that not even Paltrow&#8217;s mother received an invite.</p>



<p>In May of 2004, the now-married couple welcomed their daughter, whom they infamously named Apple.</p>

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin confirmed in January 2006 that they were once again expecting. In April, they welcomed Moses Martin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Moses&#8221; means &#8220;to draw out&#8221; and refers to a religious figure from the Torah. However, the couple revealed that they had named their second child after the Coldplay song, &#8220;Moses,&#8221; which Chris Martin wrote about Gwyneth Paltrow in 2003.</p>



<p>The happy times went on for years, with public dates and gushing about each other. Until 2013, when the couple began admitting to <em>challenges </em>in their relationship.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-paltrow-amp-chris-martin-s-divorce">Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; Chris Martin&#8217;s Divorce</h2>



<p>On March 25, 2014, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin announced their divorce in a notorious entry on her <em><a href="https://goop.com/wellness/relationships/conscious-uncoupling-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goop</a></em> brand website.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much, we will remain separate,&#8221; the couple wrote. They continued: &#8220;We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways we are closer than we have ever been.&#8221;</p>



<p>The announcement added: &#8220;We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.&#8221; </p>

<p><em>Consciously uncouple </em>has become a joking part of many people&#8217;s lexicons ever since. However, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin also went through with an actual divorce.</p>



<p>The exes finalized their divorce in April of 2015.</p>



<p>Despite that, they remained co-parents and good friends ever after. This did not change when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/gwyneth-paltrow-compares-the-sexual-talents-of-ben-affleck-and-brad-pitt-who-did-her-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paltrow moved on</a>, marrying Brad Falchuk in 2018.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chris-martin-and-dakota-johnson-is-history-repeating-itself">Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson:  Is History Repeating Itself? </h2>



<p>Speaking of moving on, Chris Martin also moved on after the divorce. He has been dating actor and nepo baby <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/dakota-johnson-cracks-tone-deaf-armie-hammer-jokes-hed-have-cannibalized-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dakota Johnson</a> since 2017. The pair have kept their affairs very private. </p>



<p>They never attend movie premieres together, never show up on each other&#8217;s arms at the Oscars &#8211; nothing like that. But things nevertheless have gotten serious for the pair. So much in fact, that marriage was on the horizon. </p>



<p>In the spring of 2024, the world learned that they were engaged, and had quietly been for years.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Martin of Coldplay performs onstage at Rose Bowl Stadium on September 30, 2023 in Pasadena, California." class="wp-image-518540" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Martin of Coldplay performs onstage at Rose Bowl Stadium on September 30, 2023 in Pasadena, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Within weeks, the rumor mill churned out all kinds of conflicting stories. Some outlets took the stance that they were actually already married, or at least very close to it. Meanwhile, others hinted that the pair may never make it down the aisle.</p>



<p>“Dakota has gotten cold feet. She loves Chris, but she’s still not sure about marriage. She’s seen too many of them end in divorce. Her mother, Melanie Griffith, has been married three times, and her father, Don Johnson, got hitched twice, so she’s hesitant to take the plunge herself. She’s not a runaway bride — she’s just not sure marriage is for her,” an insider told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/dakota-johnson-wants-to-postpone-chris-martin-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a>.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-chris-and-dakota-still-together">Are Chris and Dakota Still Together?</h2>



<p>Officially, it sounds like the pair are sticking it out. </p>



<p>In August of 2024, <em>The Daily Mail </em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13750157/Chris-Martin-fiancee-Dakota-Johnson-split-engagement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson had broken up. Their source seemed pretty firm that the pair couldn&#8217;t make the romance work any longer. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Chris and Dakota have tried desperately hard over the past few months to make their relationship work. They’ll always have love for each other but they’ve both come to the conclusion the relationship cannot be sustained long-term.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then, just a few hours later,  <em>People </em><a href="https://people.com/dakota-johnson-chris-martin-have-not-broken-up-happily-together-exclusive-8696582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the breakup news was false. The couple&#8217;s representative affirmed that they &#8220;are happily together.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a pretty firm debunking. And it&#8217;s the best that we have to go on until the next relationship update.</p>

<p>Are Chris Martin and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/dakota-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dakota Johnson</a> engaged?</p>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/chris-martin-dakota-johnson-engaged-32290448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a></em>, the couple is currently preparing to tie the knot after six years of dating.</p>



<p>A source tells the outlet that Chris popped the question “a while ago,” but he and Dakota have managed to keep their marital plans under wraps.</p>



<p>Dakota did not seem to be sporting an engagement ring during her recent press tour to promote her poorly received superhero movie <em>Madame Web</em>. </p>

<p>That might have been a mistake, as a rock on her finger could&#8217;ve provided a welcome opportunity to talk about anything other than the film. We kid!</p>



<p>Anyway, the insider says that Chris and Dakota&#8217;s engagement will not come as a surprise to those closest to the couple, as they&#8217;ve been head over heels for each other for quite some time.</p>



<p>“They have been besotted with each other from day one so taking this next step was inevitable,” a source claimed to the publication Wednesday.</p>

<p>“They are in no rush to plan the wedding but are just enjoying making their commitment official.”</p>



<p>It would be the first marriage for Dakota and the second for Chris, who finalized his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/03/chris-martin-split-from-gwyneth-paltrow-was-a-weird-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce from Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in 2016. </p>

<p>Fortunately, Dakota has Gwyneth&#8217;s blessing, and the actresses have long enjoyed a close friendship.</p>

<p>Insiders say Gwyneth feels that Dakota has been a positive influence in the lives of her two children with Chris, and Johnson has spoken lovingly about the teens on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>“I love those kids like my life depends on it. With all my heart,” Dakota said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/dakota-johnson-teatime-book-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bustle</a>.</p>



<p>Dakota also revealed that she might one day like to have children of her own.</p>

<p>“I’ve gotten to this place where I really want to experience everything that life has to offer,” said the actress and daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith.</p>



<p>“And especially being a woman, I’m like, ‘What a magical f–king thing to do. What a crazy, magical, wild experience.’ If that’s meant to happen for me, I’m totally down for it.”</p>



<p>Given how much these two enjoy their privacy, it might be a while before we find out if Dakota and Chris are planning on welcoming any children.</p>

<p>The details of Chris and Dakota&#8217;s nuptials will probably be kept under wraps until after the vows are exchanged.</p>



<p>But you can bet that the wedding will be a star-studded event with numerous A-listers on hand.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No hard feelings?<br><br>Gwyneth Paltrow won a double-victory in court during the final week of March.<br><br>The jury determined that she was not at fault, and awarded her a symbolic $1 for her countersuit. (Plus attorney fees)<br><br>In the courtroom, Gwyneth approached the man who had sued her, telling him that she wishes him well.<br><br>Apparently, that was not enough. Gwyneth is sending the guy an olive branch &#8212; in the form of <strong>Goop brand gifts</strong>.<br><br>She&#8217;s not announcing it publicly. Word is that the first gift will arrive on Saturday, April 1.<br><br>We here at <em>THG </em>have actually gotten our hands on a list of these alleged peace offerings.<br><br>But we&#8217;re talking about Goop products, here. <strong>Please </strong>don&#8217;t take this as a recommendation.<br><br>In fact, be sure to read to the end for some <em>really </em>important disclaimers.</p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>No need to be a sore winner!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">1</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Check out this list of the things that Gwyneth is reportedly sending to Terry Sanderson, whose unsuccessful lawsuit against her dominated entertainment news headlines in recent days. But, again, please always do your own research, including speaking to a doctor, before trying anything &#8212; especially Goop products &#8212; for yourself. And with this specific list, we have some helpful disclaimers based upon our own research. Enjoy!</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Vagina Candle!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">2</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Maybe this one is meant to be tongue-in-cheek or just a conversation piece, but this scented candle is one of Goop&#8217;s most infamous collabs. One major disclaimer is that it does not actually smell like Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s vagina. If someone&#8217;s genitals truly smell like a scented candle, someone may need to go to a doctor. Or to a candle store. Something isn&#8217;t right.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Bee Sting Therapy!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">3</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Just because a woman died doing bee sting therapy several years ago doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone who has undergone it has died! Most just deal with the minor inconvenience of the agonizing pain of bee venom. Controversial among vegans because it kills bees and among others because bee stings suck, many patients rate the treatment a glowing 9 &#8220;Ahhhhh!&#8221;s out of 10. Those who survive, anyway.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Comfrey!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">4</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Comfrey teas are extremely popular, and many people apply comfrey to wounds in the hope of reducing pain and swelling. Most medical advice will strongly discourage people from applying them to open wounds or to taking comfrey by mouth, as this herb contains toxins that can cause liver damage or even death. But it has such a whimsical name!</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>The Diaper</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">5</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>This one sounds a little tongue-in-cheek to give to a 76-year-old, but it could be a great conversation piece. All-natural disposable diapers that cost $10 a piece could also just be a very nice donation. Goop actually launched this (fake) product as a joke last year to raise awareness about diaper prices, but they did make physical mock-ups as part of the ad. We hope that the retired optometrist will make a good home for these.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>A literal olive branch</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">6</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>On the surface, this seems like a purely symbolic thing to send to someone. However, if you ask someone with silly enough hair, you&#8217;ll hear about various healing properties that olive trees possess. Not olives, olive trees &#8212; and, one assumes, their branches. Still, this one seems pretty symbolic.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Malachite glitter!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">7</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Seen here in its pre-glitter form, malachite dust is well known for its gorgeous green sparkle and for its high copper content! You don&#8217;t ever want to breathe or ingest malachite in any quantity in any shape or form, because the effects can include cancer and multiple types of genetic damage. But gosh, it sure is pretty!</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>A crystal ball!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">8</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Maybe it&#8217;ll make a lovely home decoration, or maybe he&#8217;ll be able to avoid legal embarrassment through the mystical power of precognition. Either way, a lovely gift. Some might advise a recipient to keep such a crystal ball by an open window to &#8220;charge&#8221; by moonlight, but given that sunlight and crystal balls can result in devastating house fires &#8230; maybe keep it covered.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>A uranium glass yoni egg!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">9</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Uranium glass has long found admiration for its luminous properties, and who says that we can only enjoy a healthy glow on the outside? Some may balk at the word &#8220;uranium,&#8221; but experts in radioactivity say that, while there&#8217;s never a need to voluntarily irradiate yourself, uranium glass is probably no more dangerous than, say, eating or drinking off of lead-based cookware. And you&#8217;re not supposed to eat yoni eggs, right?</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Psychic vampire repellent!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">10</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Do you find psychic vampires to be repellent? So does Gwyneth! It sounds like you might need some of Goop&#8217;s longtime product, a psychic vampire repellent. Just watch out &#8212; if spraying this sends you fleeing in the opposite direction, then you&#8217;ve just discovered something very negative about yourself. Or you might be allergic.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Lead paint!</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">11</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Long before the advent of &#8220;modern science,&#8221; holistic home decorators understood the spiritually protective properties of lead paint. Decades before people began using aluminum foil to neutralize the Illuminati&#8217;s telepathic surveillance and even to block off physical places from masters of remote viewing, people lined their homes with lead-filled paint to neutralize the harsh vibrations of our chaotic world. Are there devastating health side effects that have destroyed generations of human beings? Yes. But what is medical health compared to having a vibrational sanctuary?</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>APRIL FOOLS</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">12</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>You probably guessed it already, but no part of this is true. Except for the court case stuff. Also, please do not use any of the things that we listed. Well, you can get the crystal ball, and a couple of the Goop products sound like a fine way to throw away money. Please don&#8217;t put any kind of stone into any of your holes, please don&#8217;t ingest toxic herbs, please don&#8217;t burn down your house. And always read to the end of the article &#8212; especially around April 1st.</p></figure>

<p>When she saw a stray tweet that disparaged the &quot;saggy&quot; boobs of 40-year-olds, she didn&#8217;t let it slide.</p>
<p>Gwyneth took the OP to task, insisting that &quot;forties titties&quot; could be &quot;all that and a pack of chips.&quot;</p>

<p>A mostly body-positive tweet that unfortunately excluded older people took off on Twitter.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone just asked me if my boobs always have to be out,&quot; the tweet begins.</p>
<p>&quot;LMAO yes bitch,&quot; the post reads. &quot;They do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;i&rsquo;m 21 years old,&quot; the tweet continues. &quot;This is prime titty time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When i&rsquo;m 40 and they&rsquo;re saggy,&quot; the writer promises. &quot;I&rsquo;ll put them away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But until then,&quot; she asks. &quot;Can shut your mother teresa turtleneck wearing ass up and mind your damn business.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Anything that you post could always get screencapped and shared by someone hoping to boost their own page using your words.</p>
<p>That is what happened with this post about young boobs &#8212; and a certain <em>Goop </em>fiend saw them.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey now,&quot; Gwyneth Paltrow interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;40&rsquo;s titties can still be all that and a pack of chips,&quot; she wrote indignantly.</p>
<p>Gwyneth concluded her admonishment: &quot;Don&rsquo;t you forget it.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>Goop </em>founder is 46 years old and understandably was feeling a little defensive of tatas everywhere.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone believes that Gwyneth writes her own social media comments.</p>
<p>&quot;These comments from gwyn are fake as f&#8211;k,&rdquo; a post accused back in February.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel bad for poor millennial that ghost writes them,&quot; the accusation expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hope they are getting paid well,&quot; the conspiracy theorist wrote. &quot;Or some goop credit.&quot;</p>
<p>If the idea of getting paid in <em>Goop </em>credit sends a chill down your spine, don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>Maybe a nice <em>vaginal steaming</em> will warm you right up.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That conspiracy theory did not go unseen or unchallenged.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit on it,&quot; Gwyneth herself fired back. &quot;I write all this dumb stuff myself you jackass.&quot;</p>
<p>She then suggested that she uses social media to relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else do moms do in the bath with a glass of wine?&quot; she asks.</p>
<p>We have to say that we believe her.</p>
<p>What person under 39 would write &quot;all that and a pack of chips&quot; in any context?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Now, Gwyneth may have jumped the gun a little bit when she called out that boob post.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old who&#8217;s proud to have her boobs on display was speaking of herself.</p>
<p>Nowhere did she insist that women in their forties are obligated to pack away their breasts in storage.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t even say that they&#8217;re all saggy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that she expects that <em>her </em>boobs will be saggy when she&#8217;s literally twice as old as she is now.</p>

<p>Some older folks may question Gwyneth&#8217;s use of the word &quot;titties.&quot;</p>
<p>For a long time, it was used as a derogatory term to dehumanize women by discussing their body parts.</p>
<p>However, the term &#8212; and its variant spelling, <em>tiddies </em>&#8212; has been reclaimed in recent years.</p>
<p>People proudly discuss their own titties, and we say people because it&#8217;s an increasingly gender-neutral term.</p>
<p>Guys, gals, and nonbinary pals alike may discuss their own &quot;tits.&quot;</p>
<p>Seriously, if you see a discussion of Henry Cavill on social media, you&#8217;re more likely than not to find someone mention <em>his </em>tiddies.</p>
<p>We basically never say this, but good for Gwyneth for helping to take the sting out of a very fun word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Gwyneth Paltrow very clearly resides in her very own universe.</p>
<p>In case this wasn&#8217;t obvious based on the bizarre and expensive items the actress peddles on Goop, Paltrow has now shown no shame in freely admitting the following:</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on between <a href="/2019/02/khloe-kardashian-finally-dumps-tristan-thompson/">Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To&nbsp;Paltrow&#8217;s credit, if you want to phrase it that way, she <em>does</em> apparently read the Internet.</p>
<p>She <em>is</em> evidently aware that Thompson is trending today for some reason; she just doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s beause he cheated on Khloe Kardashian with one of her good friends, <a href="/slideshows/jordyn-woods-who-is-kylie-jenners-bff-who-made-out-with-tristan/">Jordyn Woods</a>.</p>
<p>She seemingly has no idea that Thompson stands accused of inviting Woods over to his house on Sunday night and then making out with her on the couch and then not saying goodbye to her until 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Or that she learned about this affair through <a href="/2019/02/khloe-kardashian-how-she-learned-the-awful-truth-about-tristan-t/">a series of very awkwad text messages</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, Paltrow is mostly clueless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she&#8217;d at least like to have a clue.</p>

<p>We know this because someone hilariously wrote the following on Instagram today in response to this sordid story:</p>
<p><em>Jordyn Woods is best friends with the worlds youngest billionaire who gifts her with cars, diamonds, and lavish vacations. </em></p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re telling me there&rsquo;s a chance she gave that all up for a guy who rides bench for the Cavs and has a community d&mdash;? THE HORROR.</em></p>
<p>Thompson is actually averaging 29.8 minutes per game this year for Cleveland, but that isn&#8217;t the point right now.</p>
<p>The point is that Paltrow actually stumbled across this comment and replied with one of her own. It reads:</p>
<p><em>Can someone explain what&rsquo;s going on? I have never heard of half of these people, someone give me context. Please. It seems serious</em></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Assuming Paltrow is familiar with Khloe, simply due to the pervasive nature of her family in the entertainment industry, this is a rather funny way of throwing shade at Thompson.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s even funnier because we totally believe that the actress legitimately has no idea who he is.</p>
<p>Cardi B, conversely, is very familiar with both people involved in this scandal.</p>
<p>And, as always, she has an opinion to share.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Why us women don&#8217;t have compassion toward each other? Y&#8217;all know I&#8217;ve been through some shit, I know y&#8217;all know I&#8217;ve been through some shit,&quot; the rapper said to her followers on Thursday, clearly angry at those taking Khloe to task for some reason.</p>
<p>&quot;This whole Khloe Kardashian thing and everybody is like celebrating that that happened to her. It&#8217;s like, why?</p>
<p>&quot;I know the Kardashians have done f-cked up shit before and everything, but the thing is, it&#8217;s like, I think the karma got to them when the last situation happened to shorty before the day she gave birth,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Cardi, of course, is citing the last time <a href="/2018/04/tristan-thompson-caught-cheating-on-khloe-kardashian/">Thompson was caught cheating</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Continuing with this theme, Cardi went on&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever karma they deserve, I think they already have it.</p>
<p>&quot;So why do you guys keep wishing that on a woman? Especially a woman that has a daughter? We know how it is when a n&#8212;a fuck up. Y&#8217;all know that your heart shatters in pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Y&#8217;all know it feels like your heart is literally bleeding and you just want to die. You can&#8217;t even escape it when you&#8217;re seeping, you dream about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Preach, Cardi B. Preach!</p>

<p>On a roll, Cardi turned her attention to Kardashian and added:</p>
<p>&quot;She already learned her lesson, something real f-cked up happened before she gave birth, so why do you guys keep enjoying other people&#8217;s pain, other people&#8217;s misery, knowing how much it hurts when a guy that you&#8217;re in love with, especially the father of your child, does something wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>In conclusion?</p>
<p>Cardi called out &quot;all these fake ass woke people&quot; celebrating women and feminism, saying they&#8217;re the same ones &quot;that will be laughing in the comments when another woman is going through some shit.&quot;</p>
<p>We rarely say this, but: Amen, Cardi B!</p>
<p>We feel for you, Keeks. You&#8217;ll get through this.</p>

<p>More like Famous Actress with the Haughy Attitude and Very Successful Lifestyle Website!</p>
<p>So says Amber Rose, at least.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In a surprise bombshell she decided to drop as a guest on a recent episode of Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag&rsquo;s podcast &ldquo;Make Speidi Famous Again,&quot; Rose has come out and said Gwyneth Paltrow slept with Jay-Z.</p>
<p>While Jay-Z was married to Beyonce.</p>
<p>As in, Paltrow is the infamous woman referred to in gossip circles as &quot;<a href="/slideshows/becky-with-the-good-hair-the-complete-list-of-jay-zs-suspected-m/">Becky with the Good Hair</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the moniker Beyonce herself gave her husband&#8217;s mistress in the 2016 track &quot;Sorry,&quot; in which she sang about Jay-Z&#8217;s infidelity and said:</p>
<p><em>He better call Becky with the good hair</em>.</p>
<p>Ever since Beyonce sang these shocking words, the Internet has been obsessed with determine just who the heck came between her marriage to the dishonest rapper.</p>
<p>And Rose says it&#8217;s Paltrow!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I definitely think that Gwyneth Paltrow is &lsquo;Becky with the good hair &hellip; I feel like she&rsquo;s the one who was, like, f&mdash;king Jay-Z,&rdquo; Rose told Montag and Pratt this week.</p>
<p>What is her evidence for the affair?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s a tad bit flimsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were like friends, and then, like, you don&rsquo;t see Gwyneth Paltrow with Beyonc&eacute; anymore,&quot; Rose explained, adding in vague detail:</p>
<p>It just seems like she was the one that was f-cking Jay-Z, and now Gwyneth lost her husband, but like Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s still with Jay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(For the record: Paltrow split from husband Chris Martin in 2014 and is now engaged to television producer Brad Falchuk.)</p>

<p>Is that really all you&#8217;ve got, Amber?</p>
<p>That Jay-Z and Beyonce used to be tight with the Iron Man actress and that&#8217;s no longer the case?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s practically more proof out there that <a href="/2016/10/khloe-kardashian-im-oj-simpsons-daughter/">OJ Simpson is Khloe Kardashian&#8217;s dad</a>.</p>
<p>The most popular theory for the mistress in question&rsquo;s identity has been fashion designer <a href="/slideshows/rachel-roy-photos-is-this-really-jay-zs-side-piece/">Rachel Roy</a>, who is also rumored to be the catalyst for Solange Knowles&#8217; 2014 Met Gala elevator fight with Jay-Z.</p>
<p>Awhile ago, Roy shared an Instagram photo with the caption &ldquo;Good hair don&rsquo;t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always. Live in the light #nodramaqueens.&quot;</p>
<p>She posted this on the same day the &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; was released.</p>
<p>However, Roy then tried to shoot down her self-created chatter, writing online later that same week:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to put the speculation and rumors to rest. My Instagram post was meant to be fun and lighthearted, it was misunderstood as something other than that.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no validity to the idea that the song references me personally. There is no truth to the rumors.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Beyonce and Jay-Z remain together, the parents of three young kids, despite the latter&#8217;s infidelity.</p>
<p>He <a href="/2018/04/jay-z-im-a-better-person-after-cheating-on-beyonce/">opened up about it this year to David Letterman</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have the emotional tools that it takes to keep my family together. And much like you, I have a beautiful wife who&rsquo;s understanding and knew I&rsquo;m not the worst of what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; the rapper told the comedian, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did the hard work of going to therapy and you know, we love each other, right? So we really put in the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;Paltrow&rsquo;s rep tells Us Weekly that this cheating allegation &ldquo;is completely absurd and 100 percent false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you buying it?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Rose now says she was just kidding, writing online:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruh we were joking on a Podcast! I have no information about anyone&rsquo;s Personal life.&rdquo;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s latest issue of <em>Goop</em> has something new &#8212; and no, it&#8217;s not yet another suggestion that <a href="/2017/01/gwyneth-paltrow-shove-rocks-in-your-vagina-to-get-better-at-sex/">readers stuff rocks up their vaginas for better sex</a>.</p>
<p>Well, that might be in there too, for all we know. But the big story, as you&#8217;ll see in the video below, is &#8230;</p>
<p>Gwyneth Patlrow and Brad Falchuk&nbsp;confirm are confirming their engagement!</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Back in November, we told you that <a href="/2017/11/gwyneth-paltrow-and-brad-falchuk-engaged/">Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk are engaged</a>.</p>
<p>Gwyneth Paltrow is, of course, a legendary actress who&#8217;s also more than dabbled in &#8230; what&#8217;s a nice word for <em>quackery</em>? Let&#8217;s go with &quot;self-help&quot; and &quot;wellness,&quot; through her <em>Goop</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Brad Falchuk is an unnecessarily handsome writer who&#8217;s been a fellow creative and even co-creator on a number of Ryan Murphy projects, from <em>Glee</em> to <em>Scream Queens</em> to <em>American Horror Story</em>.</p>
<p>Their cozy romance has warmed even our cold hearts a time or two, including when <a href="/2017/10/gwyneth-paltrow-her-halloween-costume-is-actually-good/">Gwyneth and Brad showed off an actually good Halloween costume</a>.</p>
<p>Couples costumes can say a lot about the couple themselves.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>When we reported that the couple was engaged, that was a little over a month ago and it was based upon, well, other reports.</p>
<p>They hadn&#8217;t made an official announcement.</p>
<p>Now, though, Gwyneth and Brad have come forward with an official announcement: they&#8217;re engaged.</p>
<p>They made their announcement in the newest issue of Goop, because of course they did.</p>
<p>Good Morning America reported the couple&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel incredibly lucky to have come together at this juncture in our lives, when our collective successes and failures can serve as building blocks for a healthy and happy relationship.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That statement is almost <em>normal</em> for Gwyneth.</p>
<p>Compared to her &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; from ex, Chris Martin, it sounds like what a <em>non-bonkers</em> person would say in their announcement.</p>
<p>(Though we wonder if there&#8217;s some sort of special, weird, New Age significance to &quot;juncture in our lives&quot; and &quot;building blocks&quot; but &#8230; let&#8217;s try to give them the benefit of the doubt)</p>
<p>As a public figure, Gwyneth is often disliked by people who are tired of her <em>Goop</em>.</p>
<p>(She thinks <a href="/2017/06/gwyneth-paltrow-people-only-hate-me-because-im-a-woman/">people only dislike her because she&#8217;s a woman</a>, but misogyny is, for once, not the primary source of ire)</p>
<p>But she must be very likable in person, because Brad Falchuk&#8217;s clearly fallen for her.</p>
<p>(No, we don&#8217;t just think that he&#8217;s there for the <a href="/slideshows/9-ways-gwyneth-paltrow-wants-to-improve-your-sex-life/">great, <em>Goop</em>-approved anal sex</a>)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Gwyneth and Brad reportedly discussed the possibility of engagement for at least a year before they decided to actually take that step.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so good that they decided to wait. A lot of people fall in love and think that it&#8217;s forever, and rush into a doomed marriage.</p>
<p>But Gwyneth and Brad have both been in very lengthy relationships &#8212; and even marriages &#8212; before.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t their first rodeo, so they considered things carefully.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>And, as <em>Good Morning America</em> reveals, deciding that they should <em>consciously couple</em> was about one thing in particular.</p>
<p>.. Where to go out to dinner?</p>
<p>Well, more accurately, about what sort of things they can see themselves arguing about when they&#8217;re 90.</p>
<p>Which they imagine will still be about where to go out for dinner.</p>
<p>We hope that things go well for them. Sometimes, what&#8217;s a playful argument during your first few years of a relationship can grow old and bitter when you&#8217;re decades older.</p>
