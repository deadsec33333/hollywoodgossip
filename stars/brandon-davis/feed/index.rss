<p>Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra have chosen the nuclear option.</p>



<p>Late last summer, Carly&#8217;s parents <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/catelynn-lowell-ive-been-cut-off-by-my-daughters-adoptive-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut off contact</a> with the <em>Teen Mom</em> stars.</p>



<p>Since then, Catelynn and Tyler have stopped holding back on their already low-filtered social media outbursts.</p>



<p>Now, they&#8217;re accusing Brandon and Teresa of exploiting Carly &#8212; for money. If true, that sounds very hypocritical.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-catelynn-lowell-and-tyler-baltierra-are-going-scorched-earth-on-brandon-and-teresa">Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra are going scorched earth on Brandon and Teresa</h2>



<p>On the Wednesday, April 2 episode of their <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/586-cate-ty-break-it-down-260058192/episode/bringing-the-truth-to-light-with-271561001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cate &amp; Ty Break It Down!</em> podcast</a>, Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra accused Brandon and Teresa Davis of using their legal custody of Carly for fame and for money.</p>



<p>“I know a lot of people say we are exploiting Carly or posting stuff when we were asked not to,” Catelynn acknowledged. “Part of this podcast is to also get my part out of that’s not all factual.”</p>



<p>One issue for the couple is that they say that their biological daughter&#8217;s adoptive parents are exploiting Carly &#8212; the same thing that critics accuse them of doing.</p>

<p>“When it’s beneficial for them to exploit Carly and post…” Catelynn began. In other words, she believes that Brandon and Teresa are hypocrites.</p>



<p>“They’ve kind of exploited their situation too,&#8221; she later accused. &#8220;People want to put all the blame on us like, ‘You’re on a reality TV show and they didn’t sign up for that’ but they did.”</p>



<p>When Brandon and Teresa appeared on <em>16 and Pregnant</em>, it was a one-off. The two understood it to be a documentary &#8212; and did not yet realize that it was reality TV. (Which was fairly new at that time) </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-brandon-and-teresa-as-camera-shy-as-people-believe">Are Brandon and Teresa as camera-shy as people believe?</h2>



<p>Since then, however, they have appeared in the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise more than once &#8212; and as recently as 2023. And this was allegedly to their benefit.</p>



<p>“‘If you don’t compensate us, then you’re not allowed to use these pictures on TV,&#8217;” Catelynn alleged that Brandon and Teresa had told MTV. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s hypocritical. I don’t understand,” Tyler marveled. “If it’s really a moral standpoint that you’re taking, OK.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it’s not,&#8221; Tyler pointed out. &#8220;Because you literally went on the magazine when she was five and put her face out there, and that was fine and that was OK.”</p>



<p>He is referring to the Bethany Christian Services adoption agency magazine. The Davis family appeared on the cover &#8212; back in 2012.</p>



<p>In addition to the alleged hypocrisy, Tyler and Catelynn called out a 2023 incident in which they had shown a photo &#8212; featuring only the back of Carly&#8217;s head. At the time, they&#8217;d thought that this would be within the Davis family&#8217;s boundaries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-just-about-money">Is it just about money?</h2>



<p>“They called us [after we posted the photos from the 2023 visit],” Catelynn recalled. However, Brandon apparently told her that &#8220;now MTV can&#8217;t pay us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tyler explained: “Because now it’s not an exclusive picture, we [posted] it first.&#8221;</p>



<p>“A lot of people don’t know that there’s so much backstory to our story!” Catelynn added. Clearly, they felt that they&#8217;d been sitting on this sense of frustration for too long.</p>

<p>According to Catelynn and Tyler, they often felt that Brandon and Teresa were holding their power over their heads. </p>



<p>Whether it was discouraging them from speaking ill of adoption or scolding them for costing them a payday.</p>



<p>“My thing is that we’ve stayed silent on all those little details up until now, because now we have nothing to lose,” Tyler summarized.</p>



<p>Perhaps going scorched earth on your biological daughter&#8217;s adoptive parents is not the best course of action. </p>



<p>But then, as Tyler says, they feel that the ending of all contact means that things are as bad as they can get.</p>

<p>Two months after being arrested with cocaine in his pocket outside a Hollywood nightclub, Davis pleaded guilty yesterday to possession. But, come on, he&#8217;s a Z-lister with money, do you really think he&#8217;s headed for prison?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Cops were called to the scene of Beacher&#8217;s Madhouse in April after Davis allegedly punched comedian Ben Gleib in the face. The authorities arrived, discovered the drugs on Brandon and arrested him for battery and possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, Davis has <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/06/28/brandon-davis-pleads-guilty-cocaine-possession-drugs-arrest-battery-beachers-madhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded no contest</a> to the former charge and has been sentenced him to a drug diversion program. If he completes it, both charges will be dropped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>They say misery loves company. Same goes for miserable train wrecks.</p>
<p>Lindsay Lohan and Mischa Barton definitely need to hang out more. There&#8217;s so much ambition and success to go around, it&#8217;s like a rising tide lifting all boats.</p>
<p>Or not. Sources say Lindsay, who&#8217;s &#8220;raging&#8221; over <a href="/2010/04/michael-lohan-kate-major-look-to-procreate-so-hard-lindsay-and-d/">her dad&#8217;s engagement</a> to her former BFF Kate Major (don&#8217;t ask) was in rare form this week, even for her.</p>
<p>At Nylon&#8217;s 11th-anniversary bash, she partied with her gal pal Mischa, who got into an ugly (and rather public) fight with her ex-boyfriend Brandon Davis.</p>
<p>Yup, a Greasy Bear sighting. Firecrotch was there, too!</p>
<p>The seldom-seen ursine specimen later took to his Twitter page to bash the former <em>OC</em> star, writing: <strong>&#8220;Omg. Just realized my ex turned in to 1 of the fattest people in the planet. I&#8217;m gonna start dating plus size models. Not! Mischa the Hefer.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/gallery/the-face-of-ruin/"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Wow. Classy. Not surprisingly, Mischa was hurt by Greasy&#8217;s words</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was chain-smoking the entire night,&#8221; <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/04/09/2010-04-09_lindsay_lohan_and_mischa_barton_drown_their_sorrows_in_an_allnight_bash.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says a partygoer</a>, who adds that both she and Lindsay, who have spent time in rehab, were drinking, too. &#8220;Mischa was never without a cigarette in her hand &#8211; and a puss on her face.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s more disgusting than the thought of Greasy Bear naked. To her credit, Barton called it a night around 12, while Linds was <a href="/2010/04/what-rehab-lindsay-lohan-partying-like-a-madman/">partying like mad</a> &#8217;til 6.</p>

<p>Greasy and Miranda &#8211; who just dumped Orlando Bloom &#8211; have actually been linked more than once. The latter was seen last night at the <a href="/2008/07/celebrities-come-out-for-espy-awards/">ESPYs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A couple of disclaimers</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source of this is <em>InTouch Weekly</em>. That is about as reliable as any music put out by Britney Spears being listenable.<br>
</li>
<li>This is not, however, the first time Miranda Kerr and Brandon Davis, the detestable oily heir, have been linked.<br>
</li>
</ol><p>The Victoria’s Secret model and Greasy Bear were seen together shopping on L.A.’s Robertson Boulevard last November but at the time they both insisted they were just pals. We were praying it was the case, trust us.</p>
<p>But on July 12, the ursine being, who recently split from Aussie model Cheyenne Tozzi, took a <a href="http://intouchweekly.hollywood.com/2008/07/orlando_bloom_miranda_kerr_is.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romantic turn</a> with Miranda Kerr.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Miranda Kerr and Brandon Davis in November 2007.</em></p>
<p>They were spotted canoodling at two clubs in NYC. Davis and <a href="/stars/miranda-kerr/">Miranda Kerr</a> were “full on making out” says a witness. The pair was also spotted kissing at Beatrice Inn later that night, and “They didn’t seem to care who saw.”</p>
<p>While a rep for Miranda Kerr denies she has split with Orlando Bloom, she was overheard telling <a href="/stars/brandon-davis.html">Brandon Davis</a> about the breakup.</p>
<p>“Miranda always seems to go to Brandon when she has a fight with Orlando,” the insider says. “He’s her rebound guy.”</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2008/07/miranda-kerr-brandon-davis-rebound/">Greasy Rebound: Miranda Kerr and Brandon Davis?!</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>

<p>During the phone call, Jason Davis cops to trying blow &#8220;once or twice&#8221; (he was busted for <a href="/2008/03/jason-gummi-bear-davis-on-heroin/">heroin</a> possession fairly recently) and said it&#8217;s really his brother who &#8220;does that stuff.&#8221; Brandon Davis will surely love that.</p>

<p>Getting taunted by the celebrity news media sucks, fo&#8217; sho&#8217; &#8211; but retaliating with the most disgusting slurs in the English language? Gosh.</p>
<p>The only person happy about Brandon Davis&#8217; rant Thursday night may be Michael Richards, who was just dethroned as king of the offensive tirade.</p>
<p>A member of the celebrity gossip press was definitely laying into Brandon Davis at Foxtail on Thursday night, but <a href="/2008/03/brandon-greasy-bear-davis-rips-off-scott-storch/">Greasy Bear</a> took it to whole &#8216;nother level by calling the African-American photographer a &#8220;n!gger.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pack of celebrity news photographers was stunned by this &#8211; and ripped back, calling Davis &#8220;Greasy Crotch&#8221; as well as a &#8220;d**chebag.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/gallery/scumbag/"></a></p>


<p align="center"><em> Brandon Davis: Possibly the worst human in Hollywood.</em></p>
<p>An hour later, cameras caught the <strike>pathetic</strike> <strike>scumbag</strike> oil heir fuming outside another club, Villa, where he called a TMZ photographer &#8220;a f@ggot.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was just <em>Thursday</em>.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, the ever-disgusting <a href="/stars/brandon-davis.html">Brandon Davis</a> showed up at the nightclub / scene of the crime &#8211; and was arm-and-arm with some random, unidentified black man who told the paps, &#8220;I&#8217;m a n!gga man, he likes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>How anyone would choose to hang out with Greasy Bear for any reason is beyond comprehension to us, but that&#8217;s by no means anything new.</p>
<p>Ever the coward, Davis refused to say a word. No apologies, nothing. Guess he&#8217;s the same guy who went on the legendary firecrotch rant.</p>

<p>Like his brother Jason Davis, some of the news and celebrity gossip that comes out about this oily loser continues to amuse and amaze.</p>


<p>Brandon Davis, a.k.a. &#8220;<a href="/2008/03/brandon-greasy-bear-davis-booted-out-of-hotel/">Greasy Bear</a>,&#8221; and the grandson of late oil tycoon Marvin Davis, has worn out his welcome as a house guest of one of his few remaining friends, music producer Scott Storch, according to the <em>New York Post</em>.</p>
<p>The other night, &#8220;[Brandon Davis] and Scott went out and Brandon went back to Scott&#8217;s place and crashed on the couch,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p><a href="/gallery/scott-storch-and-brandon-davis/"></a></p>


<p align="center"><em> Next to Brandon Davis, Scott Storch suddenly appears a lot cooler</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next morning, when Scott got up, Brandon Davis was already gone &#8211; and so was Scott&#8217;s $100,000 diamond encrusted watch that had been in the same room the night before. Scott called Brandon and told him the watch was missing but, ‘It&#8217;s OK &#8211; I just got a new security system, so <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/03172008/gossip/pagesix/oil_heir_loses_another_couch_102295.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything&#8217;s on tape</a>.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After learning he would be caught, Brandon Davis &#8220;started crying hysterically and saying, ‘Please don&#8217;t tell anyone, I&#8217;ll bring it back.&#8217; Scott felt bad for him and got his watch back like an hour later, so he didn&#8217;t call the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the <em>Post</em> asked <a href="/2007/04/timbaland-to-scott-storch-youre-a-btch/">Scott Storch</a> about the episode, he would only say, &#8220;I heard about this. Give peace a chance.&#8221; Davis couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2008/03/brandon-greasy-bear-davis-rips-off-scott-storch/">Greasy Bear Busted For Having Sticky Fingers</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>
