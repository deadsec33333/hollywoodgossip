<p>Though Selena Gomez appears to disparage ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber in her new album, that is not her focus.</p>



<p><em>He </em>is not her focus. Not anymore. She has a successful career <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/selena-gomez-engaed-to-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a fiance</a>.</p>



<p>But after Bieber&#8217;s latest post on social media, some fans wonder if part of him is still hung up on her.</p>



<p>Others are just focusing upon Selena&#8217;s first album in half a decade.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-has-a-new-album-full-of-sad-ballads-and-bops">Selena Gomez has a new album full of sad ballads and bops</h2>



<p>In Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&#8217;s joint album, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWJ8SWD7?crid=3DA491KS9Q1VM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.d3rBHPNRY2qlMVhXdcSrWo4kzP947HvYxklU30XYyjgvtYFvf7o6A4f0tEqMdGdDcz6R4UkuDEZUl_96NLDZUfTZZ2BerV2umD-I_sw58AbVdtVL4lffmElXYZfTLmr3mmA7ITwGdI0bKLa7pGVx_S7esIAWmal07g-QLqZsaG9qqqccrVC7tGAtBVhAVOEcvXPou5aZf9HJ3IdTHlYnnOMWeClC4FkoDu1KzqsAVIY.zHGS_8Yt629HHGaJT1AKeCRGQT_vKI43ZUVMpujmOSc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=selena+gomez+i+said+i+love+you+first+mp3&amp;qid=1742568381&amp;sprefix=%2Caps%2C121&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Said I Love You First</a></em>, the singer and her fiance have produced a solid set of tracks.</p>



<p>Even the strongest albums have some hits and some misses. But between <em>I Said I Love You First</em> and Lady Gaga&#8217;s <em>MAYHEM</em>, March 2025 has been a fantastic time for music. (And for television &#8230; and almost nothing else)</p>



<p>The first (actual) song on the album is &#8220;Young And Hotter Than Me,&#8221; an evocative ballad with palpable Lana Del Rey vibes. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;I used to feel like an angel/Now I&#8217;m a dog on your leash,&#8221; sends an unsubtle message. As does &#8220;We&#8217;re not gettin&#8217; any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.&#8221;</p>



<p>After concluding the song about the straying ex whom she wishes that she had &#8220;never loved&#8221; in the first place, Selena sings about falling back in with a former boyfriend in &#8220;Ojos Tristes.&#8221;</p>



<p>We should be leery of assuming that we know exactly what every song means. But gosh, it sure does sound like Selena Gomez is singing about moving on from Justin Bieber.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-delights-with-don-t-wanna-cry">Selena Gomez delights with &#8216;Don&#8217;t Wanna Cry&#8217;</h2>



<p>Critics are already celebrating &#8220;Don&#8217;t Wanna Cry&#8221; as a success &#8212; and a career highlight. Spring began on Thursday but <em>some </em>are calling it a contender for Song of the Summer. (That&#8217;s probably premature, and I say that as a diehard Selena fan)</p>



<p>“Now I found another hand to hold,” Selena Gomez sings, referring to moving on from Justin Bieber and other exes once she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/benny-blanco-fills-bathtub-with-nacho-cheese-as-valentines-day-surprise-for-selena-gomez-gross-or-romantic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found Benny Blanco</a>.</p>



<p>And yes, then comes &#8220;Sunset Blvd,&#8221; which is cheesy and horny and keeps threatening to discuss Blanco&#8217;s penis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Selena Gomez, benny blanco - Sunset Blvd (Official Video)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJG5CWsne8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Speaking of horny lyrics, &#8220;Cowboy&#8221; makes it clear why the album has &#8220;[Explicit]&#8221; in the title. The lyrics detail a lot of riding, and it&#8217;s not subtle.</p>



<p>In a similar vein is &#8220;Bluest Flame,&#8221; which really picks up about halfway through. Seriously, it&#8217;s like two different songs, and the second is a total bop. This song, too, is somewhat horny.</p>



<p>Selena Gomez once again seemingly shades Justin Bieber (and perhaps all exes) with &#8220;How Does It Feel To Be Forgotten.&#8221; The song is truly a taunt, but not an unfair one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-songs-are-about-her-romance-with-benny-blanco-but">Many songs are about her romance with Benny Blanco, but &#8230;</h2>



<p>In &#8220;You Said You Were Sorry,&#8221; Selena Gomez sings about an ex &#8212; possibly Justin Bieber &#8212; who did not apologize when he might have. While she&#8217;s happy to have moved on, she clearly wonders what might have been.</p>



<p>&#8220;I Can&#8217;t Get Enough&#8221; is more triumphant, with Selena singing about how she and Benny Blanco are totally wrapped up in each other.</p>



<p>Then, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Take It Personally&#8221; has a beautiful melody and lyrics that seem to blend empathy with ridicule. Selena is addressing a woman &#8212; perhaps her past self &#8212; going through relationship ups and downs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Selena Gomez, benny blanco - Don’t Take It Personally (Official Lyric Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKuuWOhJU-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The album concludes with &#8220;Scared of Loving You.&#8221;</p>



<p>This vulnerable song has Selena Gomez expressing to Benny Blanco that she fears that breaking up would be her undoing.</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re in a marriage, an engagement, a serious relationship, or discussing a serious friendship &#8212; this is the kind of fear of loss that cuts to the bone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-justin-bieber-just-respond-to-selena-gomez">Did Justin Bieber just respond to Selena Gomez?</h2>



<p>After Selena Gomez released &#8220;I Said I Love You First,&#8221; fans believe that they spied some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber shade</a>.</p>



<p>He posted a set of photos to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinbieber/p/DHcqO4fOXX_/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, one of which capturing his beautiful wife, Hailey Bieber.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s shade, it&#8217;s extremely subtle. Which is not, historically, Bieber&#8217;s vibe.</p>



<p>Perhaps we should all keep in mind that not everything is a veiled message to an ex. The odds are pretty good that some of Selena&#8217;s lyrics aren&#8217;t about <em>him</em>, either.</p>

<p>Benny Blanco has been making waves in the music business for almost two decades. Working with some of the biggest names in music on major hits has netted the producer a pretty penny.</p>



<p>While Benny has made a name for himself behind the boards, he became an even bigger star when he started dating Selena Gomez in 2023. Since getting together, the pair have gushed about each other on social media.</p>



<p>Benny&#8217;s romance with the <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>actress has been wonderful. In fact, the couple revealed that the producer had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/selena-gomez-engaed-to-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popped the question</a> in December 2024. </p>

<p>Benny has been working as a producer since 2007. He was originally mentored by Dr. Luke, who had a hand in many 2000s and 2010s hits. Luke has been accused of abuse by Kesha, but the pair reached a settlement in 2023.</p>



<p>As a producer, Benny has been behind the board or co-writer on plenty of exciting pop songs by megastars like Katy Perry, Rihanna, Britney Spears, Kesha, and more. </p>



<p>Benny has also released his own music. His debut solo album <em>Friends Keep Secrets </em>dropped in 2018.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that Benny has earned a pretty sweet chunk of change, because he played a major part in plenty of chart-topping songs that any music fan would know.</p>



<p>Most of Benny&#8217;s net worth is estimated from a 2019 catalog sale to Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited. While the exact dollar amount wasn&#8217;t disclosed, comparable deals have been estimated to be between $40 and $50 million.</p>



<p>The other big clue for how his net worth ended up clocking in at $50 million was when he bought a house a few months later. The house Benny purchased was for $9.2 million. It&#8217;s pretty safe to say that the deal was fruitful.</p>



<p>Besides Benny&#8217;s music, he&#8217;s also been pretty active on social media, especially showing off his love for cooking. In 2020, he launched a cooking show with celebrity chef and <em>The Bear </em>star Matty Matheson. </p>

<p>Their series was called <em>Matty and Benny Eat Out America</em>. In 2021, they also began another YouTube series called <em>Stupid F**king Cooking Show</em>.</p>



<p>Benny&#8217;s culinary skills have also drummed up enough interest that in 2024, he released his debut cookbook. He dropped <em>Open Wide: A Cookbook for Friends </em>in April of that year. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-selena-gomez-s-net-worth">What Is Selena Gomez&#8217;s Net Worth?</h2>



<p>Now that Benny and Selena are getting ready to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomezs-husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tie the knot</a>, some people are also wondering how much his net worth compares to his bride&#8217;s. </p>

<p>Even though the all-star producer&#8217;s net worth is certainly nothing to scoff at, it is significantly less than his future wife&#8217;s. That being said, Selena would be tough to catch up to, because she&#8217;s an actual billionaire.</p>



<p>Between music, critically-acclaimed TV shows, and her Rare beauty line, Selena&#8217;s net worth is a whopping $1.3 billion, according to <em><a href="https://parade.com/1251954/jessicasager/selena-gomez-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>.</em> </p>



<p>She&#8217;s in a small group of female musician billionaires alongside Rihanna and her pal Taylor Swift. While their net worths are far apart, Selena and Benny&#8217;s love is clearly very true to each other.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez pregnant? And getting married?! If boyfriend Benny Blanco had his way, these two would be settled down in big ways right now! </p>



<p>But sadly, a new admission from the Disney Channel superstar makes it clear that it will never happen. At least, not the way they might&#8217;ve dreamed. </p>



<p>In recent months, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/selena-gomez-met-gala-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez has been going places with Benny Blanco</a>. And when pushy fans challenge the romance, she&#8217;s not afraid to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-dating-shes-willing-to-fight-fans-over-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down the conversation</a>.</p>



<p>As her ex Justin Bieber prepares to be a dad for the first time, those same pushy fans are wondering if settling down with Benny and having a baby of her own is in the cards. </p>



<p>Despite only dating for a short time, Benny&#8217;s already been talking marriage and kids with Selena! But as for Selena Gomez getting pregnant, that&#8217;s not really in the cards. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benny-blanco-declares-his-love-for-selena-gomez-i-m-ready-for-marriage">Benny Blanco Declares His Love For Selena Gomez: I&#8217;m Ready For Marriage!</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, May 14, the 36-year-old record producer appeared as a guest on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEnD40bmMjQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Howard Stern Show</a></em>.</p>



<p>In the interview, which you can listen to below, Benny opened up about his romance with the <em>Only Murders In The Building</em> star. He detailed their first Valentine&#8217;s Day as a couple, during which he rented out a movie theater while feeding Selena Gomez an assortment of her favorite foods.</p>



<p>“You are some boyfriend, you’re knocking it out the park,&#8221; Howard Stern then praised. &#8220;I see love here, I’m predicting marriage.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">“You and me both,” Benny Blanco then declared.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">“You got a ring?” Stern asked.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">&#8220;I don’t have anything. I got no shoes on,” Blanco joked with a laugh. He then affirmed: “I gotta get my act together.”</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">“When will you propose?&#8221; Stern asked Blanco point blank. &#8220;You should make the announcement now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, this was just Stern doing what he does, egging on guests to make news. Still, he didn&#8217;t let the point go &#8211; perhaps because he could see on Benny&#8217;s face that he wasn&#8217;t insulted by the idea. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">So, Stern then reiterated his question: &#8220;When are you going to propose to your very famous girlfriend Selena?”</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0">That&#8217;s when Blanco added, very seriously: “When I look at her … I’m always just like, I don’t know a world where it could be better than this.”</p>



<p>Now THAT is a romantic!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benny-blanco-s-plans-to-propose-to-selena-gomez">Benny Blanco&#8217;s Plans To Propose to Selena Gomez</h2>



<p>In the summer of 2024, <a data-wpil-monitor-id="127" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomez-engaged-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benny Blanco and Selena Gomez</a> celebrated one year of dating. In fact, Blanco shed light on when the romance began.</p>



<p>At the time, Blanco promised that he had some &#8220;really good stuff&#8221; planned for Selena, especially considering their one-year anniversary is &#8220;right around her birthday.&#8221; As those of us who are diehard Selena stans are well aware, her birthday is July 22.</p>



<p>And she deserves. Selena is sweet, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-body-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strikingly beautiful</a>, and immensely talented. </p>



<p>However, while details of how they spent their anniversary remained private, Selena did post a photo of Benny on the happy day, calling him the &#8220;love of her life.&#8221;</p>



<p>This &#8211; along with the fact that she was spotted out and about with a ring on her finger &#8211; signaled to some that steps were being taken for them to spent forever together. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-pregnant-would-be-benny-s-next-dream-but-there-s-a-catch">Selena Gomez Pregnant Would Be Benny&#8217;s Next Dream &#8211; But There&#8217;s a Catch&#8230;</h2>



<p>Things took an interesting turn during the interview when Benny not only hinted he wanted to get hitched, but also how much he wants kids in that Stern interview!</p>



<p>“I want to have, that&#8217;s like my next goal on the box. I have a lot of God kids, I got a ton of nephews, I love being around kids.”</p>



<p>Now, before anyone gets any ideas, no, Selena Gomez isn&#8217;t pregnant right now.  That&#8217;s Hailey Bieber you&#8217;re thinking of.</p>



<p>The sad truth is, Selena may never be a mother in the traditional sense. As it turns out, in the last few years, Selena has learned that she can never get pregnant. She shared the news with her fans while promoting the latest season of Only Murders In The Building. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-can-t-get-pregnant-i-have-to-grieve">Selena Gomez Can&#8217;t Get Pregnant: I Have To &#8216;Grieve&#8217; </h2>



<p>Selena Gomez revealed she “can’t carry [her] own children” in a vulnerable new interview.</p>



<p>“I unfortunately …&nbsp;have a lot of medical issues&nbsp;that would put my life and the baby’s in jeopardy,” the actress, 32,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/selena-gomez-cover-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained to </a><em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/selena-gomez-cover-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;</em>in a cover story published in September 2024. “That was something I had to grieve for a while.”</p>



<p>Selena, who was&nbsp;diagnosed with lupus&nbsp;in 2013 and&nbsp;got a kidney transplant&nbsp;in 2017, noted that she had not “ever said this” before publicly.</p>



<p>“It’s not necessarily the way I envisioned it,” she continued of becoming a mom one day. “I thought it would happen the way it happens for everyone.”</p>



<p>However, she then clarified, “I’m in a much better place with that. I find it a blessing that there are wonderful people&nbsp;willing to do surrogacy&nbsp;or adoption, which are both huge possibilities for me.</p>



<p>“It made me really thankful for the other outlets for people who are dying to be moms. I’m one of those people. I’m excited for what that journey will look like, but it’ll look a little different.”</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, I don’t care. It’ll be mine. It’ll be my baby,” she said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-desperately-wants-to-be-a-mom">Selena Desperately Wants To Be a Mom</h2>



<p>While Selena kept her pregnancy struggles a secret over the years. , she has been very upfront about how badly she wants to be a mother down. She also has been upfront about how that might be a bit more complicated for her. </p>



<p>Selena has been open about the fact that her bipolar disorder might make it impossible for her to carry children.</p>



<p>However, despite the obstacle, she still plans to start a family one day.“That’s a very big, big, present thing in my life,” Selena told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in November 2022 while discussing how her diagnosis has affected her plans for the future.</p>



<p> “However I’m meant to have them, I will. I think there’s something over me that is maybe my bipolar that kind of just keeps me humble — in a dark way.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-truly-is-my-best-friend">&#8216;She truly is my best friend&#8217;</h2>



<p>But whatever the obstacles might be, it sounds like Benny is ready to fact them with her. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0">“People always said this to me, when you know you meet your best friend, she truly is my best friend,” Blanco described to Stern in his interview.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0">He went on to accurately describe Selena as “the coolest, nicest, sweetest.” Good!</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">“We laugh all &nbsp;f&#8212;ing day, she inspires me,&#8221; Blanco praised. </p>



<p>Blanco also made it clear that Selena&#8217;s career, fame, and talent leave him feeling a little (appropriately) intimidated sometimes.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">&#8220;I get home from work, I think i had a good day. I’m like, What did you do?’ ‘Oh I just fimed this thing with Meryl Streep and then I went to a fundraiser and now I’m recording,'&#8221; he noted.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">Blanco admitted: &#8220;My day sounds like s&#8211;t every day compared to hers.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then again, you guys are together &#8211; so how s&#8211;t could it really be! </p>

<p>Is Selena Gomez finally engaged?</p>



<p>Fans have given a lot of scrutiny to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/selena-gomez-pregnant-benny-blanco-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&#8217;s relationship</a>. Largely because he is such an <em>unknown </em>compared to her more famous (and infamous) exes.</p>



<p>Well, Selenators may be about to double down on their possibly unwarranted concerns.</p>



<p>Because the pop star and actress herself is dropping hints that&#8217;s she preparing to be a bride &#8211; and she&#8217;s looking for help to plan the perfect wedding! </p>



<p>Plus, she wore as diamond ring at the Emmys, so&#8230;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-amp-the-wedding-planner">Selena Gomez &amp; The Wedding Planner</h2>



<p>Who someone follows on social media is a pretty big deal in the year 2024.</p>



<p>It can signal who is friends, who is enemies, and who is making connections that could impact the next chapter of their life. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s the angle fans are taking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1ewfp7p/selena_gomez_has_started_following_a_wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena started following</a> CMG Weddings &amp; Events on TikTok!</p>



<p>In case the name wasn&#8217;t a dead giveaway, CMG is a wedding planning agency. Now why would someone need to follow a wedding planner if they didn&#8217;t need to plan a wedding?</p>



<p>And why would someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1en36sd/selena_hiding_engagement_ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post a photo</a> the week before following said agency in a white dress all while covering up her ring finger with a pink heart emoji?!</p>



<p>Ah, see the story gets stronger still!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-engaged-did-he-put-a-ring-on-it">Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco Engaged: Did He Put A Ring On It?</h2>



<p>As of Monday, August 22, Selena Gomez has not made any sort of engagement announcement. Neither has Benny Blanco.</p>



<p>However, maybe they don&#8217;t need to! You can find plenty of sweet moments on Selena&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C91GWhDRIkt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, but the aforementioned mirror selfie is not very subtle.</p>



<p>And also quite intentional. Why cover your ring finger purposefully with an emoji if you DON&#8217;T have anything to hide!</p>



<p>And then of course, there is that blind item that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deuxmoi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deux Moi</a>. The gossip site shared a tidbut just before the selfie that strongly suggested that Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are now engaged.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1ek7nx8/according_to_deuxmoi_selena_gomez_and_benny/">According to DeuxMoi, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are officially engaged.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Opportunity_2319/">u/No_Opportunity_2319</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/">popculturechat</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;This A-list actress/semi-retired singer got engaged over the weekend to her bf of a year recently surrounded by friends at their usual beach house hang out,&#8221; the blind item reads.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bling-at-the-emmys">Bling At The Emmys</h2>



<p>Selena is an A-list actress. She was up for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/selena-gomez-emmy-nomination-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Emmy Award</a> for her starring role on <em>Only Murders In The Building</em>, but sadly lost out to Jean Smart from <em>Hacks</em>.</p>



<p>However, her loss was far from what everyone was talking about!</p>



<p>Selena was seen proudly flashing a diamond band on her left ring finger when she stepped out to the 2024 Emmys at Los Angeles&#8217; Peacock Theater Sept. 15. While he didn&#8217;t walk the red carpet, Benny was her date for the evening as well, sitting alongside her in the front row. </p>



<p>Now, the ring was actually a Tiffany platinum band studded with marquis diamonds. So, not your typical engagement ring. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez engagement ring spotted at the 2024 emmys" class="wp-image-509407" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez arrives for the 76th Emmy Awards at the Peacock Theatre at L.A. Live in Los Angeles on September 15, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that Selena also wore four other Tiffany &amp; Co. rings, as well as a diamond cluster bracelet in platinum and a lock bangle in white gold.</p>



<p>So, could the ring have just been a fashion statement? Sure &#8211; OR Selena talked the jeweler to lend her a few other rings as a cover! </p>



<p>Guess we&#8217;ll have to keep waiting for that announcement then. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-really-engaged">Are Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco really engaged?</h2>



<p>Blind items can be glaringly accurate. As we have previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/hailey-bieber-marriage-rumors-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in detail</a>, some blind items warn about very serious matters &#8212; like Louis CK&#8217;s sexual misconduct &#8212; years before they become public knowledge.</p>



<p>However, some blind items are too vague to specify someone in particular. And sometimes, even if the source truly believes it, the news never received confirmation.</p>



<p><em>Deux Moi </em>is somewhat controversial (that may be an understatement), but that doesn&#8217;t have to mean that they&#8217;re wrong.</p>

<p>Either way, if Selena and Benny really <em>are </em>engaged, then they&#8217;re keeping this to themselves. For now.</p>



<p>There could be some very good reasons for that.</p>



<p>Two of Selena&#8217;s previous relationships have seen her besieged by busybodies. Unfortunately, this has even included her own fans.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez on January 15, 2024, attending the Emmy Awards." class="wp-image-506333" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater on January 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hopefully-fans-will-support-her-regardless">Hopefully, fans will support her regardless</h2>



<p>Selena may be keeping an (alleged) engagement under wraps because fans are weird about her dating life. She&#8217;s seemed to come into <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-dating-shes-willing-to-fight-fans-over-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conflict with fans</a> over Benny Blanco, specifically.</p>



<p>Selenators may be hesitant to endorse this romance because they don&#8217;t really &#8220;know&#8221; Benny Blanco. (Okay, one never really &#8220;knows&#8221; celebrities unless you&#8217;re friends in real life &#8212; but they don&#8217;t <em>feel </em>like they know him)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Selena is sort of sabotaging herself by keeping most of this romance so private. But also? She doesn&#8217;t actually need to worry about fan assumptions. She&#8217;s allowed to live her life.</p>

<p>Will Selena Gomez be attending the Met Gala with Benny Blanco?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-body-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez has swapped one look for another</a> over the years, but she she remains consistently gorgeous.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s as true for her Met Gala appearances as anywhere else. Selena is a style inspiration.</p>



<p>Fans always wonder what look Selena will wear if and when she attends. And right now, they want to know whether Selena will <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-dating-shes-willing-to-fight-fans-over-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring Benny Blanco</a> as her Plus One to the high fashion charity.</p>

<p>In 2014, she and other guests attended the &#8220;Charles James: Beyond Fashion&#8221; exhibition. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomez-engaged-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="129">Selena Gomez</a> arrived in a jaw-dropping Diane von Furstenburg plum gown.</p>



<p>Selena has never needed a date on her arm to accessorize. Even though she has, in fact, </p>



<p>For Gomez’s very first Met Gala—in 2014, celebrating the “Charles James: Beyond Fashion” exhibition—the star wore a plunging plum gown by Diane von Furstenburg. It’s a timeless silhouette that set the tone for almost every Met she’s attended since.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez wore a white and deeply flattering Vera Wang gown to her second Met Gala. </p>



<p>The most eye-catching part of her ensemble was a bold bouquet of white orchids in her hair.</p>



<p>Some years, however, Selena sports a simpler hairstyle to allow the focus to fall upon her dress.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2016-selena-gomez-went-subtly-futuristic-for-manux-x-machina-fashion-in-an-age-of-technology">In 2016, Selena Gomez went subtly futuristic for &#8216;Manux x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology&#8217;</h2>



<p>Selena did not try to outdo the most creative or campy guests, but she also did not ignore the Met Gala prompt.</p>



<p>Instead, she wore a Louis Vuitton embellished white slip dress below a leather corseted harness. </p>



<p>Simple jewelry accessories brought a flash of metal into the retro-futurist vibe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-would-argue-that-selena-s-best-met-gala-look-was-in-2017">Some would argue that Selena&#8217;s BEST Met Gala look was in 2017</h2>



<p>In 2017, Selena Gomez dressed to impress for the &#8220;Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons&#8221; affair.</p>



<p>Selena worse a white Coach slip dress featuring a plunging neckline. She often favors simple embroidery accents on her clothing, and 2017 is only one of many examples of that preference.</p>



<p>Notably, in 2017, Selena attended the Met Gala <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/selena-gomez-debunks-single-soon-rumor-its-not-about-the-weeknd-cmon-guys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with The Weeknd</a>. It was their red carpet debut as a couple.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2018-was-a-rare-miss-for-selena-s-met-gala-looks">2018 was a rare miss for Selena&#8217;s Met Gala looks</h2>



<p>Selena&#8217;s majestic custom Coach dress worked well for 2018&#8217;s &#8220;Heavenly Bodies&#8221; exhibition. Her makeup, however, looked better in person than on camera.</p>



<p>After 2018, Selena took years off from the Met Gala. We don&#8217;t think that it was an &#8220;oh no, my makeup wasn&#8217;t photogenic and I&#8217;m <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/selena-gomez-delivers-perfect-response-to-awful-body-shamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too ashamed</a> to show up&#8221; hiatus. She has been busy, working on her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/selena-gomez-dismisses-body-shamers-its-my-lupus-meds-go-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical</a> and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/selena-gomez-my-mind-me-offers-powerful-glimpse-into-mental-health-struggles-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mental health</a>.</p>



<p>Fans want to see Selena return to the Met Gala in 2024 and beyond. But even if she&#8217;s on the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/met-gala-guest-list-2024-newcomers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Met Gala guest list</a>, will she come alone?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-selena-gomez-bring-benny-blanco-to-the-met-gala-in-2024">Will Selena Gomez bring Benny Blanco to the Met Gala in 2024?</h2>



<p>Ahead of the event itself, it remains unclear whether Selena Gomez will actually attend. Let alone whether she and Benny Blanco will make a Met Gala debut as a couple.</p>



<p>Many Selenators do not really understand the romance. That&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s Selena&#8217;s relationship, not theirs.</p>



<p>If they <em>do </em>end up at the Met Gala side by side, it will be interesting to see their red carpet looks.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks ago, it seemed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/selena-gomez-worries-over-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-chaotic-media-frenzy/">Selena Gomez was quietly worrying about other people&#8217;s romances</a>.</p>



<p>Now, reports say, she has her own to worry about.</p>



<p>Selena spent a good amount of time this week strongly hinting that she really is dating a guy who happens to be friends with notorious ex Justin Bieber.</p>



<p>She even took to comments to defend things, growing heated as people poked fun at her taste in men. Awkward!</p>

<p>First, various reports began to note that Selena Gomez was &#8220;in a relationship&#8221; and even &#8220;dating producer Benny Blanco.&#8221;</p>



<p>Initially, these remained unconfirmed. Then, Selena commened &#8220;facts&#8221; under a report by Popfaction that she was dating someone. She also liked that same account&#8217;s claim about Benny Blanco.</p>



<p>Those are some strong hints, bordering on confirmation. But just who is Benny Blanco?</p>

<p>The Virginia native combined skill and luck to rise within the music industry. Benny&#8217;s first hit EP dates back to 2007.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a friend of Justin Bieber. And the two have collaborated on music in the past.</p>



<p>Benny also once referred to Selena as a &#8220;cookie-cutter pop artist.&#8221; In addition to being false (Selena is supremely talented and has created some of the greatest songs in the history of the world, and no that is not hyperbole), those might be words that he&#8217;s regretting right about now.</p>

<p>Allegedly, he and Selena have been dating for about six months. </p>



<p>Presumably, they had time to discuss past statements that were both insulting and patently false.</p>



<p>But here is where this report gets a little messy. Some of Selena&#8217;s followers and even fans began to give her a hard time about this.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez shared this photo to her Instagram Story on December 7, 2023.

<p>Every now and then, most people get into the mood to throw hands on social media.</p>



<p>Maybe you look at bizarre, malicious laugh reacts under an interview with a child star or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/amy-schumer-doubles-down-on-horrific-posts-amidst-israel-bombing-of-gaza-gets-called-out-by-bernice-king/">alarmingly popular pro-genocide arguments</a> or even just disputes about movies and games.</p>



<p>In Selena&#8217;s case, it was about her relationship. It would have been better, or at least wiser, to let fans talk among themselves.</p>

<p>Comment after comment shows Selena (presumably referring to Benny Blanco) refer to him as her &#8220;absolute everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another calls him &#8220;the best thing that&#8217;s ever happened&#8221; to her.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Selena wrote: &#8220;He&#8217;s still better than anyone I&#8217;ve ever been with. Facts.&#8221; That is not necessarily a high bar.</p>

<p>“He has treated me better than any human being on this planet,” read another comment.</p>



<p>“I don’t understand … this is my happiest,” she affirmed. “If you don’t [care about me] feel free to say whatever you want. But I will never allow your words to guide my life. Ever. I’m done.”</p>



<p>Selena then suggested: “If you can’t accept me at my happiest then don’t be in [my] life at all.” That&#8217;s fair &#8212; most of the time. Possibly this time.</p>

<p>Encouragingly, Selena vowed that she&#8217;s &#8220;not going to be with a f&#8211;kboy ever again.&#8221; Good!</p>



<p>Some fans believe that Selena may have been the victim of hacking. That would explain her unusually combative replies.</p>



<p>But maybe she&#8217;s just really into this guy. It sure sounds like it.</p>
