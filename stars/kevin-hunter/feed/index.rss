<p>Wendy Williams&#8217; ex wants her money &#8212; and to see her banking records.</p>



<p>In February, the <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> docuseries introduced the world to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-publicist-shawn-zanotti-docuseries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams&#8217; inner circle</a> as she experiences struggles with her health and finances.</p>



<p>Amidst <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams&#8217; diminished net worth</a>, however, there&#8217;s someone who is demanding a piece of what&#8217;s left.</p>



<p>Her ex-husband, Kevin Hunter, says that she owes him two years&#8217; worth of unpaid alimony.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-hunter-and-wendy-williams-are-divorced">Kevin Hunter and Wendy Williams are divorced</h2>



<p>In April of 2019, Wendy Williams filed for divorce. The two had married in 1999.</p>



<p>Though she cited &#8220;irreconsilable differences&#8221; as the reason for ending their two decades of marriage, her husband had grown more brazen in his extramarital relationship. To the point where he had fathered a child with his mistress.</p>



<p>Williams and Hunter finalized their divorce in January of 2020.</p>

<p>According to a report by <em>The US Sun</em>, Kevin Hunter is now <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/10687355/wendy-williams-ex-kevin-hunter-demands-divorce-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanding payments from Wendy Williams</a>. In his filing, Hunter claims that he&#8217;s not demanding anything more than the couple agreed to in their Marital Settlement Agreement.</p>



<p>Hunter says that the alimony payments abruptly ceased in 2022, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-guardianship-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams received a legal guardianship</a>.</p>



<p>It seems that he first tried out-of-court mediation. However, that has failed, and he is bringing the case to court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-hunter-depends-upon-payments-from-wendy-williams">Kevin Hunter depends upon payments from Wendy Williams</h2>



<p>&#8220;I rely on the severance pay for my living expenses,&#8221; Hunter told the court. &#8220;And having been without this income for twenty-three months has affected me greatly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hunter is also asking ex-wife&#8217;s guardianship to &#8220;immediately pay all severance payments which may be due and owing at the time of this Court’s Order.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also wants in on Wendy&#8217;s AFTRA Retirement Plan. His goal is for Williams to sign the Qualified Domestic Relations Order.</p>

<p>Additionally, Wendy Williams&#8217; ex-husband is asking the court to compel her team to fork over her financial records.</p>



<p>Specifically, he wants bank records &#8212; current ones, and those dating back to the dissolution of their marriage.</p>



<p>It seems that his goal is to investigate claims that Wendy Williams is broke. Apparently, he wants proof.</p>

<p>Obviously, Wendy Williams and her ex had a tense breakup. And money is a touchy subject in any divorce, whether a couple is rich or poor or in between.</p>



<p>But this case has even more complications. Williams herself has not had control of her own money for years. Not all of it, anyway.</p>



<p>We would like to have faith in the court system to sort this out. This whole situation is a very sad mess, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-son-my-mom-drank-so-much-she-got-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams is no longer who she once was</a>. </p>

<p>Most have their minds on wishing her well and looking forward to Sherri Shepherd&#8217;s new show in that timeslot.</p>
<p>Wendy&#8217;s ex, Kevin Hunter, has other priorities. He&#8217;s taking the production company to court.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="https://people.com/tv/wendy-williams-ex-husband-sues-production-company-wrongful-termination/"><em>People</em></a> reports that Kevin Hunter, the ex-husband of Wendy Williams, is suing Debmar-Mercury.</p>
<p>He accuses the production company behind <em>The Wendy Williams Show</em> of wrongful termination.</p>
<p>Starting in 2007, he worked as an executive producer on the program. Then, just a couple of years ago, he was fired.</p>

<p>According to Hunter, he was fired &quot;on the basis of his marital status.&quot;</p>
<p>The complaint notes that this &quot;is barred by the New York City Human Rights Law.&quot;</p>
<p>Hunter alleges that he received a notice from Ira Bernstein, founder of Debmar-Mercury, that his firing was &quot;effective immediately&quot; just days after his ex-wife filed for divorce.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Williams and Hunter were married in 1997, welcoming their son, Kevin Jr., in 2000.</p>
<p>The divorce filing in April 2019 came after, following years of cheating speculation, it was revealed that Hunter had fathered a child with a side piece.</p>
<p>It was not until 2020 that their divorce was finalized, but by then, Kevin Hunter was no longer part of the show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;The termination of Plaintiff was based strictly upon Plaintiff&#8217;s marital status and his impending divorce to the Show&#8217;s host,&quot; the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>It claims that the firing decision was made &quot;ignoring all of the contributions that Plaintiff made to make the Show a success.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of Defendants&#8217; aforesaid actions and the breach of their agreement with Hunter,&quot; the lawsuit argues, &quot;the Defendants have been unjustly enriched from Plaintiff&#8217;s Executive Producer contributions to the Show.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The lawsuit continues: &quot;as well as enduring Product Integrations engagements Plaintiff has brought to the Show and that the Show has retained.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, Kevin Hunter is arguing that he did his job to the show&#8217;s benefit, but was then fired for no other reason than that he was Wendy&#8217;s ex.</p>
<p>Many have assumed that this (or most of this) is true. But even if he can prove it, whether it actually violate&#8217;s his legal rights will be up for a court to decide.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sherri Shepherd&#8217;s show will occupy the same timeslot when it premieres later this year.</p>
<p>It is no secret that she was a guest host late last year, during a time in which the show enjoyed very good ratings.</p>
<p>Kevin Hunter claims that &quot;many of the elements&quot; of Wendy&#8217;s show are things that he &quot;helped conceptualize and the product integretions he created&quot; will be copied and pasted onto Sherri&#8217;s show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Even though The Wendy Williams Show will be over, Defendants will continue to be unjustly enriched by Plaintiff&#8217;s initial work,&quot; Hunter argues in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This is &quot;including his initial concepts created for the Show and Plaintiff&#8217;s product integration agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s saying that this new show is benefitting from years of his work, which likely describes most spinoffs.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Hunter even claims that the show &quot;never recovered&quot; following his firing, insisting that production &quot;underestimated [his] value.&quot;</p>
<p>He claims to have been &quot;an integral part of the inner workings of the Show and Debmar was unable to fill the absence of Plaintiff&#8217;s departure.&quot;</p>
<p>As such, he believes that the company &quot;breached their foregoing agreements&quot; with him by firing him, removing his EP credit, and no longer paying him.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kevin Hunter wants &quot;compensatory, punitive damages, an award of costs, interest and attorney&#8217;s fees, and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.&quot;</p>
<p>So just how much does that come out to?</p>
<p>He claims that he has lost between $7 million and $10 million, and factoring in all of the above that he lists, he likely wants substantially more than that.</p>
