<p>We&#8217;re just two weeks away from Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration as the 47th President of the United States.</p>



<p>(The occasion will be a sad one for Grover Cleveland enthusiasts, as the two-time White House resident will lose his status as the only president ever to serve non-consecutive terms.)</p>



<p>Now, we probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that Trump has a flair for showmanship and tends to feel a bit competitive toward prior presidents. </p>

<p></p>



<p>So it should come as no surprise that the former reality show host is taking steps to make his inauguration the most memorable (and, yes, the hugest) of all time.</p>



<p>According to a recent report from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/politics/trump-foreign-leaders-inauguration-invites/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, one way that Trump intends to set the occasion apart from previous inaugurations is by inviting a slew of foreign leaders and dignitaries to his swearing-in.</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Trump&#8217;s team was quick to invite Chinese President Xi Jinping, though it&#8217;s still unclear if he&#8217;ll attend the ceremony.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2182880212-1024x683.jpg" alt="Donald Trump takes the stage during a campaign rally at the J.S.

Dorton Arena on November 04, 2024 in Raleigh, North Carolina.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And now, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-william-kate-middleton-fast-tracked-throne-prince-harry-meghan-markle-grasp-celebrity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> is reporting that the leader of the world&#8217;s most populous nation might be joined by some very famous representatives of our nation&#8217;s closest allies.</p>



<p>Writing for the outlet, royal expert Neil Sean says insiders tell him that &#8220;both William and Catherine, along with the King and Queen, have all been invited to Trump’s inauguration on January 20 in Washington, D.C.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/prince-harry-nervous-following-meeting-between-trump-prince-william-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William met with Trump</a> last month when both were in Paris for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>



<p>The two spoke at length, and Trump later sang the future king&#8217;s praises. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Britain's Catherine, Princess of Wales and Prince William, Prince of Wales attend the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on November 9, 2024 in London, England." class="wp-image-516087" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183186489-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Britain&#8217;s Catherine, Princess of Wales and Prince William, Prince of Wales attend the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on November 9, 2024 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris J. Ratcliffe &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So it&#8217;s easy to believe Sean&#8217;s claim that the royals have been invited to the inauguration. But will they attend?</p>



<p>The &#8220;special relationship&#8221; between the US and UK is of paramount importance to both countries, and refusing the invitation could be viewed as an insulting snub.</p>



<p>But Trump&#8217;s history with the royals is long and complicated, and Charles and company may well decide that their best move would be to steer clear of the ceremony.</p>



<p>Before he was re-elected, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/donald-trump-prince-harry-deport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump hinted at plans to deport Prince Harry</a> in response to revelations of drug use in his 2023 memoir.</p>

<p>And Trump&#8217;s son <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/eric-trump-slams-unpopular-meghan-markle-black-sheep-prince-harry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Trump has made disparaging remarks about Harry and wife Meghan Markle</a> as recently as October of 2024.</p>



<p>Obviously, the royals are not on the best of terms with Harry and Meghan at the moment. But William probably still feels greater loyalty to his brother than to an American politician whom he just conversed with for the first time a few weeks ago.</p>



<p>And the royals are surely aware that their attendance at the inauguration would be viewed as an endorsement of Trump &#8212; which would make it a violation of the family&#8217;s long-standing tendency toward neutrality in matters of foreign politics.</p>



<p>In short, if we had to guess, we would say the royals will <em>not</em> be on hand for the inauguration &#8212; but then again, 2025 has already surprised us numerous times, and we&#8217;re not even a week in!</p>

<p>Donald Trump has provided an update on two key members of the Royal Family.</p>



<p>On December 7, the President-Elect met with Prince William (among other world leaders) in the capital of France for the ceremonial reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral&#8230; which was devastated by fire in April 2019.</p>



<p>A day later, Trump spoke to reporters about the topics he covered at the gathering with the Prince of Wales, who was representing the United Kingdom on behalf of his ailing father, King Charles.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514833" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188170189-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donald Trump meets Britain&#8217;s Prince William, Prince of Wales in the Salon Jaune room at the UK Ambassador&#8217;s Residence on the day of the reopening ceremonies of the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five and a half years after a devastating fire on December 7, 2024 in Paris, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Aaron Chown &#8211; Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I asked him about his wife and he said she’s doing well,&#8221; Trump confirmed, referring of course to Kate Middleton and her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/kate-middleton-returns-welcomes-special-u-k-visitors-see-the-photos/">ongoing recovery from cancer</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;And I asked him about his father and his father is fighting very hard, and he loves his father and he loves his wife, so it was sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>King Charles, as readers are likely well aware of, was <em>also</em> diagnosed with cancer this year.</p>

<p>Added the controversial political figure in regard to hit chat with Prince William:</p>



<p>&#8220;We had a great talk for half an hour, a little more than half an hour. We had a great, great talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>Trump also spoke about Prince William&#8217;s sex appeal, saying that he looked well and &#8220;very handsome&#8221; because Donald Trump has also been obsessed with appearance.</p>



<p>&#8220;He’s a good looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night,&#8221; Trump told the New York Post. &#8220;Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trump labeled the whole talk with William as &#8220;great,&#8221; which may explain why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/prince-harry-nervous-following-meeting-between-trump-prince-william-report/">Prince Harry had some concerns</a> about it, according to various outlets.</p>



<p>For his part, Trump has never been a very big fan of Harry&#8217;s wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a>, who spoke out strongly against the future President in the past when he ran for this same office.</p>



<p>As the two men stood in the foyer posing for photos on Sunday, Trump praised the heir apparent to the British throne, telling the press: </p>



<p>“Good man, this one. He is doing a fantastic job.”</p>



<p>Sounds like we can guess on whose side Trump falls when it comes to the never-ending <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-who-is-the-most-popular-royal-of-them-all/">Kate Middleton-Meghan Markle</a> feud, huh?</p>

<p>Prince Harry might be feeling uneasy following news that Prince William met with Donald Trump over the weekend.</p>



<p>William and Trump were both in France for the reopening of the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral, which was badly damaged by fire in 2019.</p>



<p>The pair met and spoke for about 30 minutes, and while Harry&#8217;s name might not have come up at all, experts believe the younger prince is watching the situation closely.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-s-deportation-drama">Prince Harry&#8217;s Deportation Drama</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security demanding the release of the Duke of Sussex&#8217;s visa records. </p>



<p>The group alleges that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/courteney-cox-prince-harry-tripped-on-mushrooms-at-my-house-and-he-did-not-have-my-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s admission of drug use</a> in his 2023 memoir, <em>Spare</em>, should make him a candidate for deportation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/donald-trump-prince-harry-deport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump has been critical of Harry and Meghan Markle</a> in the past, and he once stated outright that he would &#8220;not protect&#8221; the couple from being deported.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-1024x683.jpg" alt="U.S. President-elect Donald Trump meets Britain's Prince William, Prince of Wales in the Salon Jaune room at the UK Ambassador's Residence on the day of the reopening ceremonies of the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five and a half years after a devastating fire on December 7, 2024 in Paris, France." class="wp-image-514756" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-960x641.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188167294-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. President-elect Donald Trump meets Britain&#8217;s Prince William, Prince of Wales in the Salon Jaune room at the UK Ambassador&#8217;s Residence on the day of the reopening ceremonies of the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, five and a half years after a devastating fire on December 7, 2024 in Paris, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Aaron Chown &#8211; Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The subject probably didn&#8217;t come up during Trump and William&#8217;s brief meeting, but we&#8217;re guessing the sit-down still made Harry uncomfortable.</p>



<p>One royal expert believes that while Trump and William probably didn&#8217;t bond over their shared animosity for Harry, there&#8217;s still cause for the Duke of Sussex to be anxious.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-nervous-about-prince-william-donald-trump-meeting">Prince Harry: &#8216;Nervous&#8217; About Prince William-Donald Trump Meeting?</h2>



<p>&#8220;I very strongly doubt that Harry and Meghan are among the priorities of the president,&#8221; journalist Richard Fitzwilliams old <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/royal/prince-harry-meghan-markle-latest-nervous-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GB News</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;We know there&#8217;s an issue supposedly with what might or might not be on the application form for Prince Harry&#8217;s US visa. He mentioned that he&#8217;d taken drugs in <em>Spare</em>.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188263633-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks onstage during The New York Times Dealbook Summit 2024 at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 04, 2024 in New York City.

<p>One anonymous insider believes that Harry and Meghan are likely &#8220;fearful&#8221; of being targeted once Trump takes office in January,</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe they are very scared &#8212; especially since Meghan has talked badly about Trump, and I have read, seen and heard that she is very upset over the election results,&#8221; the source tells <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/inside-haggard-prince-harrys-us-visa-panic-trump-has-him-hit-list-he-meghan-very-scared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do think they are fearful, especially because of what Harry admitted in his memoir.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider even goes so far as to suggest that Harry and Meghan&#8217;s latest real estate deal was inspired by their concerns about Trump.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188268449-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, leaves the stage during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 04, 2024 in New York City.

<p>&#8220;I believe they bought this house in Portugal because of Trump in case they need another place to go if the American government deports Harry. An escape plan, if you will,&#8221; says the source.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-praises-prince-william">Trump Praises Prince William</h2>



<p>As for Trump&#8217;s impression of Prince William, it seems that the president-elect was quite taken with the future king.</p>



<p>“He’s a good-looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night,” Trump told <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/08/world-news/trump-gushes-over-very-handsome-prince-william-after-paris-meeting-some-people-look-better-in-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em> after their meeting.</p>

<p>“Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that,” he added.</p>



<p>Trump went on to reveal that he asked William about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/kate-middleton-prince-william-more-in-love-than-ever-following-cancer-battle-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Middleton, who battled cancer</a> this year.</p>



<p>“I asked him about his wife and he said she’s doing well. And I asked him about his father and his father is fighting very hard, and he loves his father and he loves his wife, so it was sad,” Trump said.</p>



<p>“We had a great talk for half an hour, a little more than half an hour. We had a great, great talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad to hear the meeting went smoothly. As anyone who&#8217;s seen <em>Love Actually</em> knows, pre-Christmas encounters between British and American leaders can easily go awry.</p>

<p>With the election down to the wire, undecided voters are looking to their role models for guidance on who to vote for. </p>



<p>For some, that actually means checking in with their favorite celebrity to see where they stand. </p>



<p>People on both sides of the aisle were pretty sure Steve Harvey was a Republican and a supporter of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/donald-trump-mug-shot-released-indicted-ex-president-surrenders-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced former president Donald Trump</a> up until recently. </p>



<p>One damning, resurfaced video showed Harvey singing Trump&#8217;s praises. His defenders suggest that they were sarcastic. Others weren&#8217;t so convinced.</p>



<p>And then he sat down with Kamala and it felt like all the pieces were falling into place. So, if Steve Harvey&#8217;s political opinion means something to you, then this is what you should know. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-steve-harvey-a-republican-and-a-trump-supporter">Is Steve Harvey a Republican and a Trump supporter?</h2>



<p>Before we delve into the answers, we have to talk about why people are asking this about Steve Harvey.</p>



<p>2024 is an election year. Despite the criminal charges against him and his defeat in the 2020 elections, Donald Trump is running again. (To be fair, the criminal charges may be a <em>motivator </em>&#8212; as Supreme Court Justices whom he appointed could end up deciding whether occupying the Oval Office makes him immune to certain prosecutions.)</p>



<p>Because of this, finding famous supporters of Trump is both elusive and important, depending on who you ask.  Enter far-right influencers on social media, who have resurfaced a specific 2017 clip of Steve Harvey. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-divorced-marriage-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey&#8217;s career</a> has made him a familiar face, and whether it&#8217;s true or not, a political endorsement from him could hypothetically sway voters.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="699" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1024x699.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey in October of 2022." class="wp-image-500308" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-768x524.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-2048x1399.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-960x656.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1080x737.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1200x819.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey attends the second preseason NBA game between Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks at Etihad Arena on October 08, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Francois Nel/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the &#8220;Ask Steve&#8221; clip from 2017, a woman in Steve Harvey&#8217;s audience asks him to help convince her husband to move to Sweden. She very memorably refers to the country as &#8220;the land of Ikea.&#8221;</p>



<p>She cited the appeal of Sweden &#8212; universal healthcare, free education, and a statistically long life expectancy. (She&#8217;s not wrong; Sweden also ranks very highly in terms of happiness)</p>



<p>As is Steve Harvey&#8217;s brand, his initial reaction was to make a silly face. He also cracked a joke about healthcare costs that one incurs from assembling Ikea furniture at home. Then, however, things took a dark turn.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-said-some-alarming-things-about-donald-trump">Steve Harvey said some alarming things about Donald Trump</h2>



<p>“Donald Trump is not gonna be that bad,&#8221; Steve Harvey said on camera in 2017. &#8220;Don’t run.&#8221;</p>



<p>He then claimed, perhaps in jest: &#8220;He’s gonna make Ikea bring they ass over here and start building them desks and stuff in America.&#8221;</p>



<p>Worst of all, Harvey then grew louder in volume and cited the campaign slogan: &#8220;‘Cause he’s gonna make America great again! Let’s go, Donald Trump.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we mentioned, some of Steve Harvey&#8217;s defenders have insisted that his words were dripping in sarcasm.</p>



<p>But, clearly, not everyone agrees with that. </p>



<p>From Twitter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/1b4etzb/resurfaced_clip_of_steve_harvey_telling_woman_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Reddit</a>, Steve Harvey&#8217;s critics and (former) fans have taken to replies to express their disappointment and disgust.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really and truly Steve Harvey I&#39;ve been a fan for quite some time but this display of ignorance has completely lost me never again will I ever devote a second of time to your ignorant butt</p>&mdash; ????AriA Blush the Fabulussy???? ????

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-s-shift-to-the-left">Steve Harvey&#8217;s Shift to The Left</h2>



<p>Now, there is a solid argument to be made that any support Steve ever had for Trump is buried in the past, and even if he is a Republican, he stands as one of the courageous few to show their support for Kamala Harris. </p>



<p>Case in point: a week before the election, Steve invited Kamala onto his r<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/harris/transcript/kamala-harris-interview-steve-harvey-syndicated-radio-october-30-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adio show</a> to sing her praises and hopefully reach some of the undecided folks she so desperately needs. </p>



<p>&#8220;You and Governor Walz are fighting for a new way forward,&#8221; Steve said to Kamala.  &#8220;You&#8217;re talking about protecting reproductive freedoms for &#8212; for women, for strengthening our democracy, and you want every person to have an opportunity to get ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Knowing his audience well, he followed up his praise with an all too important question. </p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s focus on this, that I&#8217;ve never seen done in my life, you came up with a real plan to help Black Americans&#8230;specifically, you targeted African American men. I&#8217;ve never seen that in a &#8212; can you go over some of the points?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kamala&#8217;s answered with this:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="623" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1024x623.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey in early December of 2019." class="wp-image-500309" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1024x623.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-300x183.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-768x467.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-2048x1246.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-960x584.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1080x657.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1200x730.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey speaks onstage during 2019 Miss Universe Pageant at Tyler Perry Studios on December 08, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Paras Griffin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;First of all, let me just tell you that I understand that &#8212; listen, I&#8217;m going to be and I &#8212; and I pledge to be a president for all Americans, but not all people have been affected by issues the same way. So, for example, in my agenda for Black men, it includes what we need to do around having a specific initiative that is about Black men&#8217;s health because I know that we have higher rates of colon cancer and prostate cancer, and I want to make sure we&#8217;re increasing education and screening for Black men, doing &#8212; understanding that sickle cell affects Black men at a higher rate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, she got even more specific.</p>



<p>&#8220;My plan is about knowing that Black families are 40 percent less likely to be homeowners. So, I&#8217;m going to make sure that we have $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers so they can just get their foot in the door and get on the path to living the dream of America, the American dream, which also is about being on the path to creating intergenerational wealth.&#8221;</p>



<p>And all of this really impressed Steve Harvey. </p>



<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve done my research, you know, and I really, really watched what you&#8217;ve been about and what you&#8217;ve done, I &#8212; I became more and more impressed, so has a lot of people, because it really came to the forefront. You know, when a lot of people were talking about, &#8220;Wow, I misunderstood this about her,&#8221; because, now, people have had a chance to do the research.&#8221;</p>



<p>And there it is. Maybe Steve is just one of the few to actually stand behind the line of &#8220;doing your own research&#8221; and getting behind a candidate that will look out for the many, not just the few. </p>

And his remarks infuriated Prince William.</p>



<p>And they still do to this day. </p>



<p>The initial incident occurred when the royals were vacationing in Provence.</p>



<p>Some aggressive paparazzi snapped pics of Kate from a distance using long-lens cameras.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-donald-trump-shamed-kate-middleton-infuriated-prince-william">Donald Trump Shamed Kate Middleton, Infuriated Prince William</h2>



<p>It was a shocking violation of her privacy and an infuriating induction into royal life.</p>



<p>But in a bizarre take on the situation, Donald Trump shamed Kate Middleton for allowing it to happen, sparking outrage in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/prince-william-queen-camilla-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="65">Prince William</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kate Middleton is great – but she shouldn’t be sunbathing in the nude – only herself to blame,&#8221; Trump tweeted at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wouldn’t take Kate’s picture and make lots of money if she does the nude sunbathing thing? Come on Kate!’”</p>



<p>The comments came at a very vulnerable time for Will and Kate.</p>



<p>And according to royal biographer Robert Jobson, the couple was furious over Trump&#8217;s decision to side with the tabloid press.</p>

<p>“William was reportedly furious when Donald Trump tweeted,&#8221; Jobson writes in his new book about Kate (via <em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-william-donald-trump-kate-middleton-sunbathing-b2589629.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a></em>).</p>



<p>“The entire affair had left the duchess feeling ‘violated’,” the journalist continued.</p>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be the last time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/donald-trump-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-are-totally-getting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump would comment on royal matters</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, these days, the presidential candidate mostly sticks to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/donald-trump-meghan-markle-was-mean-to-the-queen-i-would-destroy-her-in-a-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticizing Harry and Meghan</a>. And that&#8217;s probably much more to Will and Kate&#8217;s liking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-and-kate-s-feud-with-harry-and-meghan-rages-on">Will and Kate&#8217;s Feud With Harry and Meghan Rages On</h2>



<p>Elsewhere in the book, Jobson writes about Kate&#8217;s anger over details revealed in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/kate-middleton-nervous-about-upcoming-prince-harry-visit-still-refuses-to-forgive-brother-in-law-following-memoir-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s controversial memoir</a>.</p>



<p>The author says Kate was particularly furious about a passage in which Harry claimed that she confronted Meghan over comments she&#8217;s made about her behavior while pregnant.</p>



<p>“Catherine, according to Harry’s memoir <em>Spare</em>, confronted Meghan about the ‘baby brain’ comment and said, ‘You talked about my hormones. We are not close enough for you to talk about my hormones,'&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>“Meghan was surprised, according to Harry, and said it was the way she spoke to her girlfriends,&#8221; Jobson continues.</p>



<p>“William stepped in and apparently pointed at Meghan and called her ‘rude’. Meghan stood up to him and said, ‘Take your finger out of my face.’&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-interest-in-a-truce">No Interest In a Truce</h2>



<p>There were hopes that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/piers-morgan-says-hes-heard-alarming-things-about-kate-middleton-amid-princess-of-wales-continued-absence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate&#8217;s battle with cancer </a>would prompt a reconciliation between the two warring factions of the royal family.</p>



<p>Needless to say, that hasn&#8217;t happened.</p>

But she&#8217;s no closer to making peace with Harry and Kate.</p>





<p>As for Donald Trump, he&#8217;s still on a quest to recapture the White House. If he wants to increase his chances of winning, he should probably refrain from offering any further <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-defended-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defenses of Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>We know DJT loves to comment on all celebrity controversies, but that&#8217;s just not a good look in 2024.</p>

<p>Dave Bautista just obliterated Trump with a diss targeting one of his biggest fanbases: the manosphere.</p>



<p>Despite the disgraced former president&#8217;s laundry list of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/donald-trump-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felony convictions</a>, additional charges, and innumerable policy failures, some misogynists gravitate towards his unapologetic cruelty, viewing it as strength.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s time for a reality check. </p>



<p>And Dave Bautista, who is both an actor and a retired professional wrestler, is here to deliver it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-1024x576.png" alt="A still of Dave Bautista wearing boxing gloves at a gym while an ominous and frankly sad image of disgraced former president Donald Trump appears superimposed on the corner of the screen." class="wp-image-511328" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">For Jimmy Kimmel Live, actor and retired professional wrestler Dave Bautista tore into disgraced former president Donald Trump&#8217;s attempts at projecting a &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;masculine&#8221; image by administering a dose of reality.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-bautista-was-a-natural-choice-to-diss-donald-trump">Dave Bautista was a natural choice to diss Donald Trump</h2>



<p>After Jimmy Kimmel noted how some men in recent polls claim to perceived the disgraced former president as a &#8220;strong, alpha man,&#8221; he introduced a skit of Dave Bautista.</p>



<p>In the video, the actor and retired professional wrestler appear while wearing boxing gloves in a gymn.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fellas, we gotta talk,&#8221; he begins, addressing the alarming proportion of American men who see something strong and somehow worthwhile about Donald Trump. “A lot of men seem to think that Donald Trump is some kind of tough guy. He’s not.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Disgraced former president Donald Trump on October 14, 2024." class="wp-image-511324" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_donaldtrump_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Disgraced former President Donald Trump pouts during a town hall at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center on October 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I mean, look at him, he wears more makeup than Dolly Parton,&#8221; Dave Bautista continues about Trump. &#8220;He whines like a baby.&#8221;</p>



<p>While a video montage shows corroborating evidence of his claims, Bautista adds: &#8220;The guy is afraid of birds. Donald Trump had his daddy pay a doctor to say his little feet hurt so he could dodge the draft. Look at that gut. It’s like a garbage bag full of buttermilk.”</p>



<p>“He’s barely strong enough to hold an umbrella,” Bautista accuses while video shows Trump struggling with an umbrella while it is raining. &#8220;He’s got jugs. Big ones. Like Dolly Parton. And you know that little dance he does? He looks like he’s jacking off a pair of giraffes.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-bautista-continues-targeting-donald-trump-s-notorious-behavior">Dave Bautista continues, targeting Donald Trump&#8217;s notorious behavior</h2>



<p>&#8220;He’s moody. He pouts. He throws tantrums. He acts like a 5-year-old behind the wheels of a truck,&#8221; he characterizes.</p>



<p>Bautista then proposes: &#8220;This November, let’s stop kidding ourselves.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the 2024 presidential election may come down to thousands of votes in a few key districts of several swing states. The electoral college makes a mockery of democracy itself, and threatens to doom our nation and the world.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="663" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-663x1024.jpg" alt="Dave Bautista on September 9, 2024." class="wp-image-511325" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-663x1024.jpg 663w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-194x300.jpg 194w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-768x1186.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-1327x2048.jpg 1327w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-622x960.jpg 622w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-700x1080.jpg 700w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-777x1200.jpg 777w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1017_davebautista_01-scaled.jpg 1658w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Bautista attends the Los Angeles special screening of Lionsgate&#8217;s &#8216;The Killer&#8217;s Game&#8217; at Regal LA Live on September 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Did Bautista do a good job? Well, yes. He did an excellent job of the skit, both by being himself and by delivering his lines. We would expect nothing less from the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, <em>Dune</em>, and <em>Riddick </em>(2013) star. He&#8217;s a great actor.</p>



<p>The skit did contain elements of body-shaming that frankly have no place just about anywhere in society. Donald Trump&#8217;s body is solely his business. His opposition to fundamental human rights and to the rule of law, his alarming history, and the dire threat that he poses to America itself are the relevant issues.</p>



<p>But Dave Bautista did not write the skit. Jimmy Kimmel didn&#8217;t, either. And it may be worth nothing that the skit at least <em>ostensibly </em>targeted an audience &#8212; toxic, insecure men obsessed with chasing patriarchal ideals that they are convinced will make them happy &#8212; who might respond well to such disappointing rhetoric.</p>

<p>Did Donald Trump really praise Diddy and even defend him? Actually &#8230; yes.</p>



<p>Perhaps the disgraced former president should worry less about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-says-taylor-swift-will-pay-a-price-for-kamala-harris-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift&#8217;s endorsements</a> and more about his own.</p>



<p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-indictment-reveals-gruesome-details-of-alleged-freak-off-sex-gatherings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s indictment</a> sharing the gruesome details of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his alleged crimes</a>, <em>most </em>are distancing themselves from the rapper.</p>



<p>Now, as a phony photo trying to place Vice President Harris at one of Diddy&#8217;s parties keeps making the rounds, Trumps own very <strong>real</strong> comments are circulating. No need to believe us: there&#8217;s video!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-rumor-true-did-donald-trump-really-defend-diddy">Is the rumor true? Did Donald Trump really defend Diddy?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back for a second:</p>



<p>A few weeks before the election, the disgraced former president <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/trump-shares-fake-photo-harris-diddy-now-deleted-truth-social-post-rcna171993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a fraudulent photograph </a>that seemed to show Vice President Kamala Harris at a Diddy party in decades past. He posted it to his own social media site.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/RexChapman/status/1837915143138955275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The original photo featured Montel Williams</a>, who notably is <em>not </em>on trial for sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Diddy is. Trump&#8217;s intentions, insofar as someone with his mental capacities is capable of truly intending anything at this point, are obvious.</p>



<p>Trump appears alongside Diddy in numerous photos. Social media commentators have cited that he&#8217;s <a href="https://x.com/theliamnissan/status/1837979909525848190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in more pics with Diddy</a> than he is with his own terrible son, Eric Trump. This may be hyperbole.</p>

<p>Given that Trump defended Diddy &#8212; in real life, not in photoshop &#8212; this attempt at a smear was especially foolish.</p>



<p>It happened on NBC&#8217;s worst blunder, <em>The Apprentice</em>. This was on a 2012 episode of the reality series.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love Diddy,&#8221; Donald Trump announced on the episode. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s a good guy. I&#8217;m gonna stick up for him.&#8221; Truly, water always finds its own level.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-donald-trump-defended-diddy-what-was-he-talking-about">When Donald Trump defended Diddy, what was he talking about?</h2>



<p>The context of Trump defending Diddy is important. It isn&#8217;t pivotal &#8212; because it is mostly a refutation of his attempt to smear Vice President Kamala Harris by manufacturing shady ties to Diddy.</p>



<p>Donald Trump, who is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/donald-trump-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a convicted criminal</a> himself, was not referring to Diddy&#8217;s current charges.</p>



<p>Instead, he was talking about a vague suggestion by <em>The Apprentice</em> contestant Aubrey O&#8217;Day that Diddy, her former employer, might not have been a good person.</p>

<p>Trump made those comments on the first episode of the twelfth season of <em>The Apprentice</em>. </p>



<p>That deeply weird series ran from 2004 until 2017. Many Americans were largely unaware of its existence until he launched his then-farcical political campaign in 2015.</p>



<p>NBC, the same network that employed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/10/ann-curry-i-know-all-about-matt-lauer-and-his-disgusting-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Lauer</a> for years, certainly made some choices when giving Donald Trump such a platform. The show hasn&#8217;t aged well &#8212; but then, neither have Trump&#8217;s comments about Diddy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-associating-with-a-notorious-criminal-reflect-upon-the-politician">Does associating with a notorious criminal reflect upon the politician?</h2>



<p>It might. There are certainly photos of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and Harvey Weinstein with numerous politicians. </p>



<p>Why? Because a tremendous amount of what any politician does is spend time posing for photos with donors, celebrities, or simply other people at parties. They also shake hands to the point of injury, kiss babies, and go on talk shows.</p>



<p>Does it matter that Trump defended Diddy? Maybe. It probably matters more that Trump has a history of both boasting about sexual assault and being held liable for it in court. And it probably matters more that his intended policies would clearly make the United States <a href="https://democracyforward.org/work/sidebar-sexual_assault_and_the_trump_administration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a safer place for sexual predators</a> than for survivors and potential victims.</p>



<p>Defending Diddy was an expression of Trump&#8217;s poor judgment, and likely not an <em>intentional </em>expression of solidarity with a fellow monster.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has responded to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-says-shes-choosing-calm-over-chaos/">Taylor Swift&#8217;s endorsement of Kamala Harris</a> on Tuesday night by saying he totally understands her decision and wishes this artist the best.</p>



<p>Just kidding.</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t say anything like that at all.</p>

<p>“She’s a very liberal person,&#8221; said on Wednesday morning during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, referring to Swift and her decision to voice her support for Harris after Trump&#8217;s humiliating debate this week against the Democratic nominee.</p>



<p>Added Trump:</p>



<p>“She seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.&#8221;</p>



<p>Swift, of course, first endorsed members of this party back in 2018&#8230; and has since gone on to anchor the most successful tour in the history of music.</p>



<p>So, yeah. We sort of doubt any price has been paid or will be paid.</p>

<p>During this same interview, Trump gushed over the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Brittany, when asked about Swift&#8217;s political involvement.</p>



<p>(Multiple times over the past few days, Brittany Mahomes has made it clear <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/brittany-mahomes-trump-support-taylor-swift/">she&#8217;s a Donald Trump </a>group.)</p>



<p>“I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth. She’s a big Trump fan,” Trump said on Fox News.</p>



<p>“I like Brittany. I think Brittany’s great.&#8221;</p>

<p>Making a mockery of J.D. Vance and his view on women, Swift signed her endorsement this week by referring to herself as a &#8220;childless cat lady,&#8221; writing in further detail:</p>



<p><em>I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. </em></p>



<p><em>I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. </em></p>



<p><em>I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.</em></p>

<p>Swift concluded her message as follows:</p>



<p><em>I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: </em></p>



<p><em>Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! </em></p>



<p><em>I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.</em></p>

<p>Before he wages a holy war against Taylor Swift, Donald Trump is trying to make peace.</p>



<p>In the most Donald Trumpian way possible.</p>



<p>As you also may have heard, members of the Republican Party are petrified that Swift is going to endorse Kamala Harris for President any day now.</p>



<p>No one more so than Donald, who was already an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/donald-trump-to-wage-holy-war-against-taylor-swift-im-more-popular-than-you/">angry Trump about her possible endorsement of Joe Biden</a>.</p>



<p>As of yet, Taylor has not said one way or the other, and during her silence, Trump is trying to get as many possible Swifties on his side as possible. </p>



<p>Even if it means using TECHNOLOGY!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-donald-trump-falsely-claims-taylor-swift-has-endorsed-him-by-posting-ai-images">Donald Trump Falsely Claims Taylor Swift Has Endorsed Him by Posting AI Images</h2>



<p>With less than 100 days left until the November election and Kamala creaming Trump in every national poll imaginable, desperate times called for desperate measures for the former Prez.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 18, a few days after Trump and his team accused Kamala and her running mate of using AI to manipulate the crowd size of at their rallies (which they didn’t), Donald took to Truth Social to share some real, fake photos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He started off by sharing several screenshots of X posts showing women wearing “Swifties for Trump” shirts.</p>



<p>While it might be perfectly true that there are Taylor fans who will vote for him, the photos he shared all looked doctored.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that weren’t enough, one of the screenshots he shared was&nbsp; of a satire news article claiming that the cancellation of Swift’s shows in Vienna due to a thwarted terrorist plot led Swifties to turn to Trump.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But perhaps the biggest swing was a picture of&nbsp; Taylor Swift photoshopped as Uncle Sam next to the message: “Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.”</p>



<p>“I accept!” Trump captioned the post.</p>



<p>Wow &#8211; this is, sad. But it also isn&#8217;t the first time he&#8217;s tried to force an endorsement out of Taylor during this campaign. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-feels-taylor-swift-owes-him-an-endorsement">Trump Feels Taylor Swift Owes Him An Endorsement </h2>



<p>Just prior to the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl on last February, Trump shared a lengthy message on Truth Social. </p>



<p>Given that Taylor was set to be at the game to cheer on BF Travis Kelce, Trump felt it was a good time to remind the billionaire superstar all he had &#8220;done&#8221; for her.</p>

<p>For some quick context:</p>



<p>The Music Modernization Act updated copyright law to better adapt royalty and licensing payments to the age of music streaming. </p>



<p>It was a strong bipartisan effort supported by both the House and Senate &#8230; unanimously.</p>



<p>Dina LaPolt, a lawyer who worked on the law, noted to <em>Variety</em> at the time: </p>



<p>“Trump did nothing on our legislation except sign it, and doesn’t even know what the Music Modernization Act does. Someone should ask him what the bill actually accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wait, so Donald Trump doesn&#8217;t understand how the government works? And/or he just told the public a major lie?</p>



<p>We. Are. Shocked.</p>



<p>Concluded Trump in this desperate plea for attention for affection:</p>



<p>&#8220;There’s no way [Swift] could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money. </p>



<p>&#8220;Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal, and probably can’t stand me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/taylor-swift-will-she-endorse-kamala-harris-heck-has-she-already/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="218">Taylor Swift did endorse</a> Joe Biden.</p>



<p>Despite all the talk about how she&#8217;s some kind of government asset and how the NFL worked with the White House to rig the Super Bowl (claims actually made by certain individuals), the singer has never been particularly political active.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s occasionally encouraged her legion of fans to simply go out there and vote, which we&#8217;re pretty sure is the point of living in a Democracy.</p>



<p>Trump, however, is likely afraid that these Swifties will vote for Kamala Harris instead of him this November, now that the tide has change to the first female presidency being on the line. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swifties-for-kamala-when-will-the-mastermind-weigh-in">Swifties For Kamala: When Will The Mastermind Weigh In?</h2>



<p>As we said, Taylor has been hush hush since Kamala took over the Democratic nomination from Joe Biden. </p>



<p>But that&#8217;s likely intentional.</p>



<p>Experts keep reiterating that the highly influential superstar is likely delaying her public endorsement of Harris to ensure maximum impact at the polls this November.</p>



<p>She hold the power and she knows it &#8211; and so does Trumpy!</p>



<p>Because in truth, while she&#8217;s never bad mouthed him directly, she&#8217;s been very clear that she&#8217;s not a fan indirectly. </p>



<p>Case in point: in an interview with&nbsp;<em>The Guardian</em>&nbsp;back in 2019, Taylor explained that she started to become more politically active following Trump&#8217;s defeat of former Secretary of State&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&nbsp;at the end of the 2016 election cycle.</p>



<p>&#8220;The things that happen to you in your life are what develop your political opinions,&#8221; she told the publication. &#8220;I was living in this Obama eight-year paradise of, you go, you cast your vote, the person you vote for wins, everyone&#8217;s happy! This whole thing, the last three, four years, it completely blindsided a lot of us, me included.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, if you think she&#8217;s not going to be giving Kamala her allegiance, you&#8217;re delulu, Mr. Trump!</p>

<p>When Trump shades Miley, it could be a desperate reach by his strategists. Or it could just be the ramblings of a deeply unpleasant man.</p>



<p>Disgraced former president Donald Trump seems to be making <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/donald-trump-taylor-swift-beautiful-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird statements about famous women</a> part of his campaign.</p>



<p>His latest target is Miley Cyrus.</p>



<p>Upon singing the praises of her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/donald-trump-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notorious felon</a> complained about the man&#8217;s much more famous daughter.</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 27, Donald Trump gave a speech at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville.</p>



<p>(That may sound random, but cryptocurrency barons have been <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-crypto-billionaires-buying-washington-1235068940/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pouring money</a> into the Trump campaign in the hopes of widespread deregulation.)</p>



<p>As is his habit, the infamous criminal spoke in a stream-of-consciousness manner. He noted that Billy Ray Cyrus was in the audience.</p>

<p>“Billy Ray Cyrus is here,&#8221; Donald Trump announced. &#8220;Where is Billy Ray?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s around here someplace, and he&#8217;s great,&#8221; he claimed wildly. </p>



<p>Apparently saying whatever came to mind, Trump rambled: &#8220;He&#8217;s a conservative guy. I said, ‘How did you get such a liberal daughter?’ How did that happen, Billy Ray?&#8217;”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-donald-trump-shade-miley-cyrus">Why did Donald Trump shade Miley Cyrus?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s sometimes difficult to explain why a man like Trump shades someone, let alone someone as popular as Miley. In this case, he was also seemingly <em>negging </em>one-hit-blunder Billy Ray. Weird way to treat your apparent supporters.</p>



<p>One would almost think that he is &#8220;blaming&#8221; Billy Ray. </p>



<p>But, as we will explain momentarily, perhaps he was alluding to Billy Ray Cyrus&#8217; recent and viral audio in which he said vile things about his own daughter.</p>

<p>The answer to his question, of course, is that it&#8217;s normal for children to not be carbon copies of their parents. Miley is also a Millennial and part of the LGBTQ+ community.  </p>



<p>Both of those have statistical boosts to left-leaning politics. Billy Ray, a straight white male Boomer who considers himself a Country musician, is no surprise on the other side of the aisle.</p>



<p>To be blunt, when you politicize who someone is and threaten their human rights, you&#8217;re arguably deciding their political affiliations <em>for </em>them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miley-shades-with-the-best-of-them">Miley shades with the best of them</h2>



<p>In the past, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/miley-cyrus-hannah-montana-disney-legends-d23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="85">Miley Cyrus</a> has spoken very openly about the disgraced former president. </p>



<p>When Trump ran in 2016, Miley described him accurately as a &#8220;f&#8211;king nightmare&#8221; on her Instagram page.</p>



<p>Then, following his electoral victory that year, she lamented the loss for America on <a href="https://x.com/MileyCyrus/status/796377820091981824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr">❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙 <a href="https://t.co/kuETRP7tb0">pic.twitter.com/kuETRP7tb0</a></p>&mdash; Miley Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) <a href="https://twitter.com/MileyCyrus/status/796377820091981824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>We promised to explain why Trump might shade Miley in apparent agreement with Billy Ray. Recently, a leaked audio recording showed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/miley-cyrus-skank-devil-billy-ray-tish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Ray Cyrus call Miley a &#8220;skank&#8221; and &#8220;devil&#8221;</a> during a vicious, expletive-laden rant.</p>



<p>He also put soon-to-be-ex-wife Firerose and his ex-wife, Tish, on blast.</p>



<p>When a man speaks about his own family in that way, he seemingly invites others to do the same. Bizarrely, this was a rare instance of Trump being the &#8220;nice&#8221; one. Relatively.</p>
