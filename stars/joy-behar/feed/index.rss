<p>Joy Behar has been a staple on <em>The View </em>for nearly 30 years, but is it <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/joy-behar-happy-to-be-fired-from-the-view-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time for her to pack it up</a>?</p>



<p>The comedian and talk show host recently marked her 82nd birthday on air, and while she&#8217;s been holding her own, a few followers shared messages saying that it was time for her to retire.</p>



<p>But is that really in her plans? And honestly, should it? As an OG member of the panel, shouldn&#8217;t she stick with the show as long as she wishes?</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joy-s-big-birthday">Joy&#8217;s Big Birthday</h2>



<p>Joy turned 82 on October 7, 2024, but a few days before, she had a special <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/whoopi-goldberg-leaving-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebration with her co-hosts </a>on <em>The View</em>. Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah-Griffin, and Ana Navaro all helped Joy begin her next trip around the sun.</p>



<p>As the ladies walked on stage, a huge birthday message for Joy was projected behind their table. The comic made a hilarious joke to start off the episode. </p>



<p>&#8220;I would tell you my age, but I think you might fact-check me,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>During the episode, they had a few moments to celebrate Joy&#8217;s birthday, including an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixnGbllyVAU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with her friend Nathan Lane. The iconic actor had a very sweet message for the talk show host on her birthday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Nathan Lane On Starring In Menendez Brothers TV Adaptation | The View" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixnGbllyVAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As Nathan got on stage, he turned to Joy, and he shared a birthday message. &#8220;By the way, you do not look whatever age you&#8217;re admitting to. You have looked the same since 1998. You&#8217;re the Paul Rudd of daytime television,&#8221; he quipped.</p>



<p>Of course, Nathan wouldn&#8217;t show up on his friend&#8217;s birthday empty-handed! &#8220;Because Joy is still a hot Italian woman, I have ordered Joy a hot Italian pizza,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Then, a good-looking pizza delivery man arrived on set. As he crossed the stage, he tossed the box and pulled off his shirt. He then proceeded to show off his sexy dance moves on the show.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-tell-joy-behar-to-retire">Fans Tell Joy Behar to Retire</h2>



<p>For another segment, Joy also had a tag sale for charity. She and her <em>View </em>co-hosts sold off a few collectible pieces of memorabilia to benefit The Retreat, an organization that helps domestic abuse victims.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Joy Behar Celebrates Her Birthday With A Tag Sale | The View" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HnkjTiVZltw?start=8&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>After the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnkjTiVZltw&amp;t=8s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clip</a> was posted on YouTube, a couple of viewers chimed in to suggest that Joy should call it quits. &#8220;Happy Birthday Joy. You are getting OLD. [time] to retired [sic] dear,&#8221; one fan wrote. &#8220;Joy it’s time to retire,&#8221; another person commented.</p>



<p>Despite the suggestions, Joy still clearly has the energy to keep on filming <em>The View</em>. She regularly cracks jokes and weighs in on hot topics for the daily show. Even at 82, she seems just as ready to show up for work.</p>



<p>While there were a few naysayers, the overwhelming amount of comments were positive. &#8220;I can’t believe Joy is 82. She looks amazing!&#8221; one viewer said. </p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s one of the most youthful acting 82 year olds I&#8217;ve ever seen, not to mention how good she looks too. She has some great genes,&#8221; another fan wrote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-joy-behar-said-about-retiring">What Has Joy Behar Said About Retiring?</h2>



<p>Over the years, Joy has spoken about retirement on <em>The View</em>. In February 2023, she explained that she doesn&#8217;t think she&#8217;ll ever truly retire while <a href="https://x.com/TheView/status/1620820354431127552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussing</a> Tom Brady&#8217;s exit from the NFL.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="763" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-1024x763.jpg" alt='Joy Behar attends the "Rock &amp; Roll Man" Off Broadway Opening Night at New World Stages on June 21, 2023 in New York City.' class="wp-image-518949" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-1024x763.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-300x224.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-768x572.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-2048x1526.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-960x716.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-1080x805.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1500443907-1200x894.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joy Behar attends the &#8220;Rock &amp; Roll Man&#8221; Off Broadway Opening Night at New World Stages on June 21, 2023 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as retirement for me, because I&#8217;m a creative person. So, I&#8217;ll do something else,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I leave this show, I&#8217;ll do something else.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a more recent appearance on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/joy-behar-gets-candid-about-why-shes-been-open-about-her-age/id1585703147?i=1000654973818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Behind The Table </em>podcast</a>, Joy discussed the possibility of retirement with producer Brian Teta. A fan wrote a message to commend her on continuing to work in her 80s, and the comic explained when she&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s time to retire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well you know you happen to be lucky with me in the fact that I will know when it’s time to go you don’t have to tell me and not because I’m not going to be doddering, old and on my behind but because it will be enough already,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Still, Joy explained that she&#8217;s still happy to be on <em>The View</em>. &#8220;At this point, it’s still interesting to me, the show,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>In February of 2025, Joy took a hiatus from the show, but the reason has nothing to do with her age or health.</p>



<p>As Whoopi explained, Behar has temporarily shifted her focus to another project &#8212; her new off-Broadway show My First Ex-Husband, which opened at Mac-Haydn Theater in New York last week.</p>



<p>So while the haters might not like it, it sounds like Joy won&#8217;t be retiring anytime soon!</p>

<p>Joy Behar getting fired was a &#8220;happy&#8221; event for the <em>The View</em> host. Why?</p>



<p>Despite decades of success, many wonder if and when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-view-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The View</em> will be canceled</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/whoopi-goldberg-leaving-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The View </em>co-hosts leave</a>, cycling in and out. The biggest deals are when they&#8217;re the show&#8217;s primary antagonists or when they&#8217;re staples of the hit daytime talk show series.</p>



<p>With a few interruptions, Joy Behar has been part of the show since its inception. Why was she fired? Why was she &#8220;happy&#8221; to be fired?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joy-behar-has-discussed-being-fired-from-the-view">Joy Behar has discussed being fired from &#8216;The View&#8217;</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s more than just one show. Joy Behar has used <em>The View</em> to touch upon her past firing from <em>Good Morning America</em>.</p>



<p>As it turns out, she has been fired from <em>GMA </em>twice. Speaking to <em>The View</em> guest Kumail Nanjiani in 202, she revealed that she had been &#8220;the worst receptionist&#8221; in the show&#8217;s history. </p>



<p>She also alleged that the show had taken her to Chippendales as a &#8220;goodbye present&#8221; while letting her go. It is possible that she was jokingly exaggerating circumstances.</p>

<p>In 2007, Joy Behar left <em>The View</em> despite having helped launch the hit daytime talk show series. Initially, it appeared to be a voluntary situation.</p>



<p>However, in 2022, she <a href="https://people.com/tv/why-joy-behar-left-the-view-in-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divulged to</a> <em>People </em>that &#8220;somebody wanted me gone&#8221; in 2013. Her exit wasn&#8217;t as cordial as it seemed &#8212; she&#8217;d been fired. The series, it seemed, was trying to shift away from political discussion.</p>



<p>Joy Behar believed that the show had been going down the wrong path. Her 2022 commentary noted: &#8220;That&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve been fired for my politics.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-joy-behar-was-happy-to-be-fired">But Joy Behar was &#8216;happy&#8217; to be fired</h2>



<p>Her 2013 firing, which was followed by her return as a guest host and then full reinstatement in 2015, was not as unhappy as it would be for most people.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was glad to be fired,&#8221; she admitted to her co-hosts on The View. </p>



<p>Her reason was simple: she missed her friends, and &#8220;all&#8221; of her friends on the show were gone at that point.</p>

<p>When Joy said this, Whoopi Goldberg expressed a (perhaps joking) degree of hurt.</p>



<p>Joy quickly explained two key points. The first was that she was referring to producers, hair and makeup, and others behind-the-scenes. </p>



<p>And the second was that, at the time, Whoopi was still new to the show. (Whoopi had been part of the panel for several seasons in 2013, as she&#8217;d started in 2007. But &#8230; okay)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-view-is-an-oft-problematic-touchstone-for-the-culture">&#8216;The View&#8217; is an oft-problematic touchstone for the culture</h2>



<p>No one on <em>The View</em> is completely right about everything. Not even your faves. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/bella-thorne-to-whoopi-goldberg-stop-blaming-girls-for-hacked-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Not even <em>our </em>faves</a>.</p>



<p>And even the worst antagonists that she show has cast, panelists like Meghan McCain and Elizabeth Hasselbeck who&#8217;s <em>real </em>jobs were to make negative headlines and get &#8220;owned&#8221; by other hosts, have been at least <em>a little bit</em> right <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/10/meghan-mccain-i-hate-the-trumps-but-i-love-erika-jayne-for-some/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <em>some </em>topics</a>.</p>



<p>The series showcases real (albeit famous) people and their opinions, right and wrong. And to churn out viral moments, memes, memorable quotes, and <em>cringe </em>content. The daytime talk show ecosystem wouldn&#8217;t be the same without it. Or without Joy Behar.</p>

<p>Has <em>The View </em>really been canceled?</p>



<p>Over the years, the legendary talk show has been a place for both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/jenna-lyons-reveals-her-hair-teeth-are-fake-due-to-genetic-condition-that-inspired-her-fashion-career/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heartfelt conversations</a> and some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/joy-behar-blackface-photo-emerges-view-host-comes-under-major-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nauseating scandals</a>. <em>The View</em> has produced viral moments and memes and more.</p>



<p>Now, a persistent rumor suggests that ABC is canceling the daytime series. Even more alarming, for weeks the show has been flip-flopping between live episodes and previously recorded shows.</p>



<p>So, is it really over? And if so &#8211; WHY?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-view-amp-it-s-legacy">&#8216;The View&#8217; &amp; It&#8217;s Legacy </h2>



<p><em>The View</em> premiered on ABC in 1997 after legendary journalist Barbara Walters created and, for years, hosted it.</p>



<p>The daytime talk show features multiple generations of women. Many of them are experts in their fields, others just famous faces, but all of them have something to say about &#8220;hot topics&#8221; from politics to culture and beyond.</p>



<p>This August marks the 27th anniversary of <em>The View</em>. It has been a mainstay of ABC&#8217;s daytime programming block for nearly three decades.</p>



<p>Which is why it feels weird that new episodes have been few and far between. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-people-still-love-watching-the-view">People Still Love Watching &#8216;The View&#8217; </h2>



<p>Ostensibly, viewers tune in to ABC&#8217;s long-running daytime talk series for a combination of celebrity commentary, relatable takes, and even legal expertise.</p>



<p>From journalists to famous actors to legal professionals to nepo babies to reality TV personalities, <em>The View </em>boasts an array of different points of view. It sort of goes with the name.</p>



<p>Some would argue that the panel being all-women is just a gimmick. Others would say that it&#8217;s refreshing to go a few minutes every day without hearing men&#8217;s opinions on current events &#8212; since male voices tend to overwhelmingly dominate so many aspects of life, entertainment, and culture.</p>

<p>Obviously, Barbara Walters was a living legend, but a rotation of notable woman have followed her at the table.</p>



<p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell was quite the character, and very memorable during her time on the show. Sherri Shepherd once sat on the panel, but now has her own show, having taken the timeslot of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor Wendy Williams</a>.</p>



<p>Even people who are mostly famous for their time on <em>The View </em>have produced, as we noted, memes and viral moments. The clip of Ana Navarro above is a prime example.</p>



<p>Often, short clips of the talk show &#8220;break containment&#8221; (that is, go well beyond their target audience of somewhat older women) and become widely popular. Especially when the hosts fight or do what we can only describe as <em>misbehave</em>.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hasselbeck was part of <em>The View </em>from 2003 through 2013. She didn&#8217;t win her Emmy Award for competing on <em>Survivor</em>, after all. She quickly became infamous for her, well, bad takes on a number of events.</p>



<p>Hasselbeck set a specific tone for the show. The network has since tried to replicate her role, casting other &#8220;villains&#8221; (for lack of a better term) like Candace Cameron Bure and Meghan McCain to instigate drama. </p>



<p>Notably, we&#8217;re not referring to conservative hosts, here. Nicolle Wallace &#8212; who worked for the George W. Bush White House&#8211; and Jedediah Bila, Ana Navarro, and Abby Huntsman are all noted conservatives. They never stepped into the &#8220;villain&#8221; roles like <em>some </em>others, however.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-running-low-on-villains-may-get-the-view-canceled">Running low on villains may get &#8216;The View&#8217; canceled</h2>



<p>For years, Meghan McCain held the role as <em>The View</em>&#8216;s primary antagonist. She would literally huff angrily while other hosts spoke, which was an unbecoming and childlike response to disagreements.</p>



<p>Obviously, a lot of people on social media were eager to see ABC show her the door. In July of 2021, McCain announced her upcoming departure, citing her family&#8217;s move.</p>



<p>But even as some viewers cheered, we couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if it&#8217;s good for the show to see such a dramatic person &#8212; one who&#8217;s right just enough of the time to keep you guessing, but is so often loudly wrong &#8212; leave. After all, <em>The View </em>survives on ratings, not on maintaining a moral and behavioral standard.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-the-view-really-been-canceled">Has &#8216;The View&#8217; Really Been Canceled?</h2>



<p>In the summer of 2023, rumors that <em>The View</em> is ending began to take root. Those rumors have continued into 2024 and have continued for MONTHS</p>



<p>However, as of July 2024, there are no indications &#8212; not from behind the scenes or any public announcements &#8212; that the rumors are true.</p>



<p>At present, ABC has not canceled <em>The View</em> and likely doesn&#8217;t plan to any time soon.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re worried about why there aren&#8217;t any new episodes the answer is quite simple: summer hiatus. </p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean big changes aren&#8217;t coming for the show. </p>



<p>“After 10 years and 2,143 episodes, this is the last show we’ll do from this studio,” Sunny Hostin revealed during an episode of the daytime talk show on August 2.</p>



<p>However, before the crowd could get too concerned that the show was being axed, Sunny explained that the show would be carrying on, but from a new location. </p>



<p>“We’re sad to say goodbye, but we are thrilled to be moving to a brand-new studio downtown — brand-new, state-of-the-art — and we will see you there in September for the premiere of season 28!” she said.</p>



<p>Phew! Close call!</p>
