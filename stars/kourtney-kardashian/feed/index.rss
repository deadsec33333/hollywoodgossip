<p>Kourtney Kardashian knows what people out there are saying, thinking and writing on social media.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s heard the rumor for awhile now.</p>



<p>But is she mad? Is she upset? Is she full of rage that some folks out there really think <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> is the father of her 10-year old son, Reign?</p>



<p>LOL, you guys. No!</p>

<p>“Kourtney doesn’t give any heed to the reports that Justin is Reign’s father,” <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/how-kourtney-kardashian-feels-about-rumors-justin-bieber-is-reigns-dad/">a source told</a> Us Weekly on April 1, adding of the reality star&#8217;s reaction: </p>



<p>“She thinks it’s ridiculous and laughs that people online would even believe that.”</p>



<p>Indeed, this seemingly insane line of thinking has gone viral enough that young Reign himself actually responded to it this week.</p>



<p>The 10-year old hoped to shut down the conspiracy theory via an Instagram Live shared by his stepsister Alabama Barker’s boyfriend, Scooter Jackson.</p>

<p>“No, he’s not. Bro, I swear, Justin Bieber is not my dad,” Reign told viewers in a clip from the stream shared on TikTok yesterday. “Scotty … Scotty … Scotty is my dad.”</p>



<p>This really is the truth.</p>



<p>Reign is the youngest of Kardashian’s three children with ex Scott Disick&#8230; including son Mason, 15, and daughter Penelope, 12. The couple famously dated on and off for nine years before ending their relationship for good in July 2015.</p>



<p>Having been around for a decade, Reign even did the math for those who believe this rumor about Bieber.</p>



<p>“I don’t know how old my mom was, but I think Justin Bieber was 16 when I got born. I don’t think my mom would do that,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Kourtney was 35 when this son was born, meaning she would have been impregnated at the time by a minor and would have actually broken the law.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1024x576.png" alt="Kourtney Kardashian loses a few buttons on Season 5, Episode 9 of The Kardashians." class="wp-image-504253" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Explaining her nanny and how she&#8217;s spending limited time away from her baby, Kourtney Kardashian chats on The Kardashians Season 5, Episode 9.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There <em>was</em> chatter awhile back that Kardashian and Bieber were kinda sorta dating.</p>



<p>Bieber was around 21 years old when he was linked to Kardashian following her split from Disick. </p>



<p>“Justin started hanging out with Kourtney alone because she started going out more,” an insider told Us way back in December 2015. “She never really went out before, so he’s been showing her a good time.&#8221;</p>



<p>This same tabloid quoted an anonymous source that alleged Bieber had &#8220;bragged to friends recently that he has been hooking up with Kourtney Kardashian.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still. This fling would have taken place years after Reign was born.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="689" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-689x1024.jpg" alt="Kourtney Kardashian attends the TAO Chicago Grand Opening Celebration at TAO Chicago on September 15, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois." class="wp-image-504200" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-689x1024.jpg 689w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-202x300.jpg 202w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-768x1141.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-1379x2048.jpg 1379w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-646x960.jpg 646w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-727x1080.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-808x1200.jpg 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-scaled.jpg 1724w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kourtney Kardashian attends the TAO Chicago Grand Opening Celebration at TAO Chicago on September 15, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Schear/Getty Images for TAO Chicago)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Oddly, this is the second quasi paternity scandal that Kardashian has faced over the last several weeks.</p>



<p>She previously slammed talk that her son <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kourtney-kardashian-denies-15-year-old-son-has-a-love-child/">Mason has a child of his own</a>.</p>



<p>“I rarely address rumors or conspiracies regarding myself or my family, but this is about my child and it feels wrong to let anyone think for a second that these lies are remotely true,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on March 2. “They are not true. Mason does not have a child.”</p>



<p>She added back then:</p>



<p>&#8220;He is a kid with feelings and a beautiful life ahead of him. Please stop spreading false narratives and spinning lives. And to all the other people making videos about my kids (who, by the way, are minors), please stop and leave them alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian is defending Mason Disick against an outrageous rumor.</p>



<p>Mason only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/scott-disick-mason-car/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned 15 years old</a> in December. </p>



<p>Yet a hurtful, outlandish rumor has alleged that he has a &#8220;secret baby.&#8221; </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kourtney-kardashian-denies-15-year-old-son-has-a-love-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney speaks out</a> to defend her eldest, Mason is returning to social media.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mason-disick-is-back-on-public-social-media">Mason Disick is back on (public) social media!</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Mason Disick took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/masondisick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story, marking his social media return.</p>



<p>The post itself was casual, showing him on a night out with friends.</p>



<p>Mason often keeps himself partially obscured in photos. It is normal for teens to feel self-conscious, but it is possible that he is also hoping to be able to go a few places without being recognized. For the son of Kourtney Kardashian, that is a challenge.</p>

<p>Mason Disick does not currently live with mom Kourtney Kardashian. He is instead living with his dad, Scott.</p>



<p>However, he&#8217;s still clearly living the life of a teen son of famously affluent parents. He and his friends were wearing high-end clothes appropriate for Gen Z.</p>



<p id="eP54IbXsGg">Mason&#8217;s post did not reference the ugly rumor targeting him. But his mother, however, did make a post to nip that claim in the bud.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-wants-to-quash-this-ugly-rumor">Kourtney Kardashian wants to quash this ugly rumor</h2>



<p>On March 2, Kourtney Kardashian took to her Instagram Story to quash the rumor that Mason Disick secretly became a father in 2024.</p>



<p>The unsubstantiated claim alleges that Mason fathered a child named Piper, who was born in 2024. This claim comes from a hoax account that pretended to be Mason. If it&#8217;s true, there&#8217;s certainly no proof.</p>



<p>And Kourtney said all of that and more in her post. </p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian has taken the unusual step of talking about one of her kids in public.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because the Internet has taken the not-so-unusual step of circulating a sort of insane rumor &#8212; this one applying directly to one of the reality star&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, some folks on social media have been claiming that Kourtney&#8217;s 15-year-old son Mason Disick &#8212; whose dad is Scott Disick &#8212; had recently welcomed a child of his own, prompting the following response from an offended and irritated Kardashian.</p>



<p>&#8220;I rarely address rumors or conspiracies regarding myself or my family, but this is about my child and it feels wrong to let anyone think for a second that these lies are remotely true,&#8221; the Hulu personality wrote in a March 2 Instagram Story post. </p>



<p>&#8220;They are not. Mason does not have a child. These accounts that pretend to be him are definitely not. They are FAKE.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Kourtney notes here, there&#8217;s always a lot of chatter out there about her or her siblings&#8230; such as the idea that husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/travis-barker-accused-of-controlling-kourtney-kardashian-after-they-welcome-their-first-child/">Travis Barker is in control of their marriage</a>.</p>

<p>But this is her son here, you guys. The star has no real choice but to speak out.</p>



<p>&#8220;My son really values his privacy, and I am asking all media to please be respectful: he is a kid with feelings and a beautiful life ahead of him,&#8221; Kardashian added. </p>

<p>The 45-year-old also shares Penelope Disick, 12, and Reign Disick, 10, with Scott, as well as 15-month-old son Rocky Barker with husband Travis Barker.</p>



<p>For the most part, Mason has pulled back from the public in recent years &#8212; for example, he is no longer appears on The Kardashians.</p>



<p>But the teenager <em>has</em> started to appear in family photos again and recently went public with his own Instagram account.</p>



<p>In May of last year, Mason launched this page and uploaded rare photos of himself looking quite grown up on the social media platform.</p>

<p>The 15-year received stunned and emotional reactions from his aunts Khloé Kardashian and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> in the comments section as they responded to the aforementioned pictures.</p>



<p>“I can’t believe this is happening,” Khloé, while Kim chimed in as follows in reference to her nephew: “You’re really on Instagram.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mason is most definitely growing up.</p>



<p>“He’s starting to really like girls, and obviously girls like him,” Scott told Khloe on the January 8 episode of her Khloe in Wonder Land podcast. </p>



<p>“I just said, ‘You can do whatever you want, just don’t lie and don’t manipulate any girls. So if a girl tells you she wants to maybe do something with you and, like, hook up or whatever, if she knows that you’re not in a relationship with her, don’t tell her you are just to get something out of her.’”</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-welcome-first-child/">welcomed their first child together</a> last year. And of course, we&#8217;re thrilled for the couple.</p>



<p>However, some of the ostensibly sweet details that have emerged in the months since have left fans feeling &#8230; troubled.</p>



<p>Now, a growing number of Kourt&#8217;s followers are raising the alarm &#8212; and calling out Travis as &#8220;controlling.&#8221;</p>

<p>A  while back, we reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barkers-baby-name-leaked-and-its-pretty-silly/">Travis and Kourtney&#8217;s baby name</a> would likely be &#8220;Rocky.&#8221; </p>



<p>Then, just days before welcoming their son, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/travis-barker-reveals-baby-name-due-date-of-son-with-kourtney-kardashian/">Travis confirmed</a> the news. It&#8217;s a name that he had discussed in the past.</p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s first child together is named Rocky Thirteen.</p>

<p>Travis likes the name &#8220;Rocky&#8221; because that is the name of his favorite musician. Specifically, the guitarist for Suicidal Tendencies.</p>



<p>Thirteen is simply Travis&#8217; favorite number. That&#8217;s sensible &#8212; it&#8217;s a great number!</p>



<p>&#8220;I like Rocky 13,&#8221; he previously told his teenage daughter, Alabama. &#8220;That&#8217;s the name that&#8217;s just been going through my head lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, the wee lad&#8217;s name is Rocky Thirteen Barker.</p>



<p>That sounds harmless enough, even if &#8220;Rocky&#8221; sounds like a name that one would give to a puppy. We&#8217;ve heard much worse.</p>



<p>So what&#8217;s the issue? Well &#8230; it all comes down to how all three parts of the name come from only one of the parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Travis is controlling in my opinion,&#8221; opined one Reddit denizen.</p>



<p>&#8220;He’s the one who named their son,&#8221; the redditor reasoned, &#8220;based on his interests.&#8221; And not on Kourtney&#8217;s.</p>



<p>&#8220;Idc if Kravis fans will start to attack me for this,&#8221; the social media user continued, &#8220;but this is giving major red flags.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like both Kourtney and Travis’s wedding was all based off his vibe,&#8221; the Reddit user described.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; that redditor concluded, &#8220;Kourtney changed her whole wardrobe to match his style.&#8221;</p>



<p>Certainly, we have seen Kourtney&#8217;s sense of style evolve into a &#8220;rocker&#8221; vibe. Even in maternity photos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her allowing this baby’s name to be Rocky Thirteen will confirm for me that he is controlling,&#8221; a commenter noted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rocky, that’s one thing. Not my vibe, and not the real Kourtney’s vibe, but I could see it,&#8221; this second redditor noted. &#8220;THIRTEEN? Baby, this ain’t stranger things!!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Another commented: &#8220;Yeah I don&#8217;t like that the new kid&#8217;s name is completely Travis&#8217;s interest. Kourt was the only one that had normal names for her kids and then Barker wanted Rocky 13.&#8221; (Point of order: Kourtney has a son named <em>Reign</em>)</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems very controlling,&#8221; another Reddit user worried. &#8220;And the only reason why Kourtney accepts it, is because to her he loves and is devoted to her.&#8221;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ll pardon the pun, the months since the baby&#8217;s birth have been a bit &#8230; rocky.</p>



<p>Insiders have suggested that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kourtney-kardashian-sons-against-travis-barker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney&#8217;s elder kids are not fond of Travis</a>.</p>



<p>And there was one incident in which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kourtney-kardashian-painful-decision-rocky-travis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney was forced to leave Rocky behind</a> during a trip to Australia.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no reason to believe that she did so at Travis&#8217; behest, but fans have jumped to that conclusion. Because too often the more dramatic explanation is preferable to the accurate one.</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian getting in on the Ozempic obsession is not going over well.</p>



<p>A number of celebrities have confessed to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/tori-spelling-ozempic-mounjari-weight-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial use of Ozempic and Mounjaro</a> for luxury weight loss.</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian seems to be trying to cash in on the interest in Ozempic. But she&#8217;s getting called out, and with good reason.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kourtney-kardashian-rolling-out-her-own-take-on-ozempic">Is Kourtney Kardashian rolling out her own take on Ozempic?</h2>



<p>Yes and no.</p>



<p>Last week, Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s supplement brand, Lemme, revealed its new product. </p>



<p>The new supplements purportedly aid in weight loss, and people are immediately drawing connections with Ozempic.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-1024x576.png" alt="Kourtney Kardashian appears on the The Kardashians Season 5 trailer." class="wp-image-499520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_thekardashians_02_kourtneykardashian.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the Season 5 trailer for The Kardashians, Kourtney Kardashian details the drastic steps required during her high-risk pregnancy.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, Lemme is offering a pill &#8212; not semaglutide injections like Ozempic users take.</p>



<p>Ozempic injections contain a synthetic version of a hormone, GLP-1. The human body very naturally releases the real version of this hormone into our bloodstreams after we eat, though the timing, volume, and effectiveness vary from body to body.</p>



<p>Lemme&#8217;s pill is not Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s replica of Ozempic. The pills claim to offer a more natural attempt to promote the release of the real hormone in order to decrease one&#8217;s appetite. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kourtney-kardashian-s-line-of-weight-loss-pills-the-same-as-ozempic">Is Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s line of weight loss pills the same as Ozempic?</h2>



<p>Marketing makes it seem like Lemme&#8217;s pills are some sort of all-natural replacement for the controversial injections.</p>



<p>And the new supplement&#8217;s name is GLP-1 Daily. This really feels like a direct reference to Ozempic, even if GLP-1 is a natural hormone.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the most pivotal difference may be that these supplements do not cause <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/danielle-cabral-condemns-ozempic-misuse-for-weight-loss-run-on-a-f-king-treadmill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortages of diabetes patients&#8217; life-saving medicine</a>. </p>

<p>A number of fans are expressing high levels of criticism. </p>



<p>Appetite-suppressants as weight loss tools are already controversial, as they essentially allow people to trick their bodies into ignoring hunger. It doesn&#8217;t fit with some of Kourtney&#8217;s past &#8220;body-positive&#8221; statements.</p>



<p>Additionally, a number of commenters don&#8217;t seem convinced that the product works at all. Not from trying the (very newly announced) Lemme supplements, but because of the science involved.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-critics-aren-t-sure-if-the-lemme-pills-are-worth-it">Critics aren&#8217;t sure if the Lemme pills are worth it</h2>



<p>The Lemme pill will allegedly naturally increase levels of the hormone over time. The ingredients include lemon and saffron extracts.</p>



<p>&#8220;These do not mimic GLP-1 medications as nothing oral can mimic it for weight loss,&#8221; scolded on commenter. &#8220;It will systemically be engulfed by enzymes in a few minutes. Do better, Kourtney.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other critics simply pointed out that the price point was absurd. Cheaper (and more ethical) than real Ozempic, but at what (literal) cost?</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian reportedly has something in common with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise:</p>



<p>One of her kids wants very little to do with her.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve reported in the past on how <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/tom-cruise-still-wants-nothing-to-do-with-daughter-suri/">Cruise doesn&#8217;t speak to daughter Suri</a>&#8230; and we&#8217;ve also mentioned how Brad <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/shiloh-jolie-name-change/">Pitt&#8217;s child has dropped her dad&#8217;s last name</a>.</p>



<p>Things are not nearly that dire between Kourtney and 14-year old son Mason.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-506509" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-960x641.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1243212633-2-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kourtney Kardashian poses on the runway at the Boohoo by Kourtney Kardashian show during New York Fashion Week on September 13, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, Life &amp; Style now reports that the teenager has chosen to live with his father, Scott Disick, on a full-time basis.</p>



<p>“She is heartbroken over it. While Kourtney is giving Mason space to work through his feelings, at the end of the day, she blames Scott,&#8221; an insider tells this tabloid.</p>



<p>Kourtney dated Disick for over a decade; along with Mason, they are parents to Penelope, 12, and Reign, 9.</p>



<p>Kardashian is now married to Travis Barker and welcomed a son named Rocky with him in November 2023.</p>

<p>“Scott always tries to be the cool dad,” the Life &amp; Style source went on. </p>



<p>“The kids can have all the sugar and junk food they want [at his house], and they can stay up as late as they want and watch whatever they want. [He] buys them anything they ask for. It’s no surprise they all love going to his house. </p>



<p>&#8220;They love their dad, but it helps that it’s a free-for-all when they’re over there!”</p>



<p>We have heard in the past, too, that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kourtney-kardashian-sons-against-travis-barker/">Kourtney&#8217;s sons are not big fans of Barker</a>.</p>

<p>On season 5 of The Kardashians, Penelope, Reign and Rocky joined their mom and Barker on a trip to Australia for Blink-182’s tour.</p>



<p>But not Mason.</p>



<p>“Mason [doesn’t want] to come,” Kourt told the cameras on the Hulu show. </p>



<p>“He’s a teenager and he wants to be with his friends and his dad.” </p>

<p>From what we can gather, Kourtney and Mason still have a relationship.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just not in the sort of place Kardashian wants it to be right now.</p>



<p>“People have told her it’s just a natural part of life and that Mason will come back to her once he establishes his own identity, but it’s still painful,” the magazine source says. </p>



<p>“Kourtney’s doing her best to accept that Mason would rather be with Scott right now. She says it’s because he’s a teenage boy who needs his dad, but it’s not easy.”</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian could not help but express disappointment that her older two sons seem to be turning against Travis Barker. Though they&#8217;re showing it in different ways.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kourtney-kardashian-painful-decision-rocky-travis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week&#8217;s episode of <em>The Kardashians</em></a>, Kourt and some of her family were in Australia. Travis had been touring with his band, Blink 182.</p>



<p>Mason, her eldest, remained at home with dad Scott Disick. Penelope and Reign joined Kourt for the trip, as did baby Rocky, of course.</p>



<p>But Reign was quick to comment on how <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/travis-barker-divorced-his-marriage-history-with-kourtney-kardashian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney and Travis</a> might need some time apart. Have Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s sons developed negative feelings against Travis Barker?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-take-the-kids-to-sydney-for-travis">Kourtney Kardashian Take The Kids to Sydney For Travis</h2>



<p>&#8220;I am in Australia, we made it, we&#8217;ve been having the best time,&#8221; Kourtney Kardashian announced, referring to her trip with her kids. Well, most of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Travis is touring to different cities in Australia for about a week,&#8221; she detailed. &#8220;Because I was on bed rest before and having a newborn at home, I haven&#8217;t really had any outings with my other kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kourtney then explained: &#8220;So, I really wanted to stay in Sydney.&#8221;</p>

<p>One hot topic when it comes to Australia was the wildlife. Kourt said that she could never live in Australia because of the spiders. The prevalence of sharks also maker her anxious. (The shark bite capitol of the world is in Florida, just for the record)</p>



<p>&#8220;Who cares? 1%, we&#8217;re gonna get bit. I&#8217;ll take the risk!&#8221; Reign then joked regarding potential shark attacks. He is currently 8 years old, and clearly has a <em>great </em>sense of humor.</p>



<p>When it comes to Australia, crocodile safety is more vital than shark and spider dangers combined. Unlike those two, crocodiles see humans as food. Australian saltwater crocodiles can grow large enough to hunt sharks. Please do not feed the salties.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mason-disick-the-eldest-of-kourtney-s-sons-did-not-join-her-and-travis">Mason Disick, the eldest of Kourtney&#8217;s sons, did not join her and Travis</h2>



<p>Unlike Penelope, Reign, and Rocky, Kourtney&#8217;s eldest son did not join her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mason is home with his dad,&#8221; Kourt told the camera. Mason&#8217;s father, like Penelope&#8217;s and Reign&#8217;s, is Scott Disick.</p>



<p>Kourtney then commented that this is something &#8220;which makes me really sad, but I&#8217;m making the most of every second.&#8221; She did not choose to clarify why Mason had elected to stay home. However, that&#8217;s not an unusual choice for a young teen (if they&#8217;re given the choice).</p>

<p>While making &#8220;the best of it,&#8221; Kourtney focused upon the kids who were with her. Reign&#8217;s sense of humor came up. He has a vibrant personality.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where he gets his sense of humor. He&#8217;s like a mini Jim Carrey,&#8221; Kourtney shared with the confessional camera. One assumes that the Carrey comparison stems from his comedic facial expressions. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starting to get a lot of vibes like his dad,&#8221; Kourt then observed. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s starting to get that sense of humor. I&#8217;m like, just what we need.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-were-all-over-each-other">Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker were all over each other</h2>



<p>For Travis Barker, this is a work trip. Blink-182, his band, has avoided international tours for many years. Only his relationship with Kourtney and their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-marry-again-in-lavish-ital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxurious Italian wedding</a> encouraged him to fly again. </p>



<p>(He did famously survive a literal plane crash)</p>



<p>As soon as Kourtney and Travis locked eyes, they were also locking lips. And this did not go unnoticed by Kourtney&#8217;s son, Reign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mom, stop making out with Travis, bro!&#8221; Reign exclaimed during their luxury boat trip. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you just have a baby. Don&#8217;t get another one this quick!&#8221; Oh, he&#8217;s <em>funny</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a beautiful thing to see parents, especially ones that just had a new baby, be affectionate and loving,&#8221; Kourtney then emphasized. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.&#8221; Generally speaking, she&#8217;s not wrong.</p>



<p>When Travis moved to kiss Kourtney&#8217;s neck, Reign asked: &#8220;Are you giving her a hickey now?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-reign-disick-against-travis-barker-or-just-acting-his-age">Is Reign Disick against Travis Barker or just acting his age?</h2>



<p>Travis clarified that he was simply giving Kourtney a &#8220;gentle kiss.&#8221; Kourtney explained to her son that she&#8217;d simply missed her husband.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Reign is just expressing an age-appropriate aversion to his mom&#8217;s PDA or if there&#8217;s a more personal angle.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s similarly unclear if Mason was avoiding a lengthy family trip when he&#8217;s a teen. That is the simplest explanation. But some viewers speculate that both of Kourtney&#8217;s non-infant sons have developed hostile feelings towards Travis. Their mom&#8217;s marriage is still a major adjustment.</p>

<p>But apparently, she&#8217;s already had to make at least one difficult decision for his protection.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The family had traveled Down Under to join Kourt&#8217;s husband, Travis Barker, for the Australian leg of Blink-182&#8217;s world tour.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the family was not greeted as warmly as Kourtney had hoped.</p>

<p>As the episode shows, Kourtney and her clan were harassed by paparazzi from the moment they touched down.</p>

<p>“That’s annoying,” Kourtney said as she noticed one aggressive photographer.</p>



<p>“Alright, I don’t see us standing out here for a long time if that guy’s here.”</p>



<p>“We can’t let them ruin our whole time,&#8221; Kourtney later explained to her kids.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, venturing out into hostile territory with an infant just isn&#8217;t prudent.</p>

<p>So Kourtney made a difficult decision regarding her youngest child.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-hired-a-nanny-for-rocky-during-her-time-in-australia">Kourtney Kardashian Hired a Nanny For Rocky During Her Time In Australia</h2>



<p>Up to that point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/kourtney-kardashian-admits-exhausting-week-while-isolating-from-family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney had been by Rocky&#8217;s side 24/7</a>.</p>



<p>“The paparazzi are everywhere in Sydney. Everywhere, which is why I’m not taking Rocky out,&#8221; she explained on camera.</p>



<p>“But as much as I would love to stay home and be in my bubble, it’s not fair to have my kids all the way in Australia and not take them out to do things,” Kourtney acknowledged.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="689" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-689x1024.jpg" alt="Kourtney Kardashian attends the TAO Chicago Grand Opening Celebration at TAO Chicago on September 15, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois." class="wp-image-504200" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-689x1024.jpg 689w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-202x300.jpg 202w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-768x1141.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-1379x2048.jpg 1379w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-646x960.jpg 646w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-727x1080.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-808x1200.jpg 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-scaled.jpg 1724w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kourtney Kardashian attends the TAO Chicago Grand Opening Celebration at TAO Chicago on September 15, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Schear/Getty Images for TAO Chicago)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-s-separation-anxiety">Kourtney&#8217;s Separation Anxiety</h2>



<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s not unusual for rich and famous people to hire nannies. But as Kourtney explained this was her first time taking on extra help for Rocky.</p>



<p>“We haven’t been using a nanny or a baby nurse with Rocky at all, but now that we’re in Australia, it was important to bring someone so that I could leave the house and go out with the other kids and do adventures with them,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>“I really schedule each adventure around his nap. Then I have a window of being gone. Two and a half hours is my time where I feel like I’m ready to go back.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1395058218-2-1024x683.jpg" alt='Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian attend The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An Anthology of Fashion" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.

<p>In a moment that was no doubt relatable to many moms, Kourtney went on to explain that she often felt overwhelmed with guilt when leaving Rocky behind.</p>



<p>“I hate leaving him; I get antsy, like, We’re taking too long; what are we doing?!&#8221; she explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think probably for the next three months, I will be like that.”</p>



<p>Kourtney has spoken about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kourtney-kardashian-details-long-painful-astounding-ivf-journey-to-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the IVF journey that led to Rocky&#8217;s conception</a>, and it was clearly a very long and difficult process.</p>



<p>So it makes sense that she would be unusually protective of the boy. We applaud her strength in making a tough decision for the benefit of her older kids.</p>

<p>Before he could find happiness with Kourtney Kardashian, Travis Barker had to go through a seriously messy divorce.</p>



<p>Yes, these days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-marry-again-in-lavish-ital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis and Kourtney are blissfully married</a>. </p>



<p>In fact, they celebrated their love with <em>multiple</em> wedding ceremonies in 2022.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="676" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1239729331-1024x676.jpg" alt="Kourtney Kardashian and musician Travis Barker arrive for the 64th Annual Grammy Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022.

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kourtney-kardashian-details-long-painful-astounding-ivf-journey-to-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney and Travis welcomed their first child together</a>, a boy named Rocky Thirteen.</p>



<p>Needless to say, their relationship appears to be progressing nicely.</p>



<p>But in order to reach this point, both of Rocky&#8217;s parents had to endure some serious heartbreak.</p>



<p>Kourtney has three kids with Scott Disick, but due to reluctance on Scott&#8217;s part, the long-term partners never married.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="648" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1239729490-1024x648.jpg" alt="Kourtney Kardashian and musician Travis Barker arrive for the 64th Annual Grammy Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022.

<p>That turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>



<p>Travis <em>also</em> has kids from a previous marriage, but he wasn&#8217;t as fortunate in dodging the divorce bullet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-travis-barker-is-divorced-twice-over">Travis Barker Is Divorced Twice Over</h2>



<p>The Blink-182 drummer married his first wife, Melissa Kennedy, in 2002.</p>



<p>The marriage lasted just nine months and did not produce any children.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2004, Travis married his second wife, Shanna Moakler, in a Halloween Eve, <em>Nightmare Before Christmas</em>-themed wedding.</p>



<p>They welcomed two children together, and their relationship inspired an MTV reality show entitled <em>Meet the Barkers.</em></p>



<p>Their son, Landon, was born in 2003. Their daughter, Alabama &#8212; named for a character in Travis&#8217; favorite movie, <em>True Romance</em> &#8212; was born in 2005.</p>



<p>Sadly, the marriage was not meant to last. And Travis and Shanna did <em>not</em> part ways amicably.</p>

<p>In fact, even though they finalized their divorce back in 2008, it seems that there&#8217;s still quite a bit of bad blood between the exes.</p>



<p>Shanna has lashed out at Travis several times in the years since he started dating Kourtney.</p>



<p>She even went so far as to claim that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/shanna-moakler-travis-barker-tried-to-cheat-on-me-with-kim-kardashian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis slept with Kim Kardashian</a> before he began a relationship with her older sister.</p>

<p>Shanna insists that Travis cheated on her with Kim, but there&#8217;s no evidence that that hookup ever took place.</p>



<p>Moakler has also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/shanna-moakler-calls-out-kourtney-kardashian-you-came-between-me-and-my-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Kourtney of negatively influencing her kids</a>.</p>



<p>Travis&#8217; ex has given a number of scathing interviews on the subject of the Kardashians. But thus far, Kourtney has taken the high road and opted not to respond.</p>



<p>So yeah, Shanna probably won&#8217;t be invited to Travis and Kourtney&#8217;s inevitable vow renewal ceremony.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s a shame because knowing these two, it&#8217;ll be quite a shindig!</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have had a very complicated relationship over the years.</p>



<p>But for all of their ups and downs, the exes have always managed to prioritize their kids&#8217; happiness and maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship.</p>



<p>So it came as a surprise to many fans when Kourtney posted a Father&#8217;s Day tribute to Travis Barker &#8212; but failed to mention Scott at all.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-pays-tribute-to-travis-barker">Kourtney Kardashian Pays Tribute to Travis Barker</h2>



<p>“Happy Father’s Day @travisbarker !! Beyond grateful for the Dad that you are to our baby boy, and all of our kids,” Kourtney wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8SgfEayZKk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>“You keep us safe and protected and take care of us. Having a family with you is heaven. Happy to celebrate you!”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kourtney-kardashian-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney married Travis</a> in 2022, and clearly, she&#8217;s still head over heels for him.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last year, the couple welcomed their first child together, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-welcome-first-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocky Thirteen</a>, and it seems that Kourt is a big fan of Travis&#8217; parenting skills.</p>



<p>But what about her father of her other children?</p>



<p>Yes, despite the fact that they have three kids together, Kourtney made no mention of Scott in her Father&#8217;s Day post.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1094653140-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kourtney Kardashian attends the amfAR New York Gala 2019 at Cipriani Wall Street on February 6, 2019 in New York City.

<p>And that decision didn&#8217;t sit well with some of her followers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-criticized-for-snubbing-scott-disick">Kourtney Kardashian Criticized For Snubbing Scott Disick</h2>



<p>“I actually find this so disrespectful that you haven’t included your other kids with Scott,&#8221; one commenter wrote, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/06/17/parents/kourtney-kardashian-blasted-for-snubbing-ex-scott-disick-in-fathers-day-post-to-travis-barker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is the father of your 3 other children in case you had forgotten about him and them.&#8221;</p>

<p>“What about scott? ‘Grateful for the dad that you are to ALL of our kids?’ these kids have a father, he’s [sic] name is Scott,” another added.</p>



<p>“What about the father to your other 3 children…. Scott? That’s crazy to not thank him. Kourt wild! Crazy,” a third fan chimed in.</p>



<p>“Wait! What Scott is the father to your oldest children? He’s a good dad too be nice to acknowledge that also,&#8221; a fourth remarked.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it seems that Scott wasn&#8217;t bothered by the alleged snub.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/06/17/scott-disick-fathers-day-car-breaks-down-dinner-nobu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, the father of three took his kids for dinner at Malibu hotspot Nobu.</p>



<p>“Thanks my loves 4 making this day what it is to me!&#8221; he wrote on Instagram.</p>



<p>So this is probably just a case of fans looking to stir up drama where none exists.</p>



<p> It&#8217;s a phenomenon that Kourtney and Scott must both be well-accustomed to by now.</p>
