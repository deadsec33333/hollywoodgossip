<p>Jessica Simpson is publicly flirting with Jeremy Renner.</p>



<p>At least, that&#8217;s what it looks like. </p>



<p>Fans are delighted to see the singer putting herself out there in music and beyond after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jessica-simpson-divorce-eric-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end of her 10-year marriage</a>.</p>



<p>Many associate Renner with his MCU role and his still recent, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/10/jeremy-renner-my-ex-wife-sent-photos-of-my-penis-to-the-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bitter divorce</a>. But Simpson seems seriously thirsty for his workout videos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-jessica-simpson-publicly-flirting-with-jeremy-renner">Is Jessica Simpson publicly flirting with Jeremy Renner?</h2>



<p>Jeremy Renner is most famous for his role as Clint Barton (Hawkeye) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is second most famous for launching his very own app, to widespread confusion and outright derision.</p>



<p>Anyway, in addition to being the reason why comics fans have to patiently explain that Clint Barton is a beloved character (just <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/10/jeremy-renner-abused-cocaine-threatened-to-kill-ex-wife-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not in the MCU</a>), Renner keeps busy posting workout videos to social media.</p>



<p>Jessica Simpson, who (as always) can do better, seems to have taken an interest in his fitness routine.</p>

<p>Under one of Renner&#8217;s recent Instagram videos, in which the 54-year-old actor appears shirtless during his workout, Simpson left a comment.</p>



<p>Specifically, she left a fire emoji comment.</p>



<p>While Renner did not write out a reply, he did give the emoji a &#8220;like.&#8221;</p>



<p>And no, this is not an isolated incident.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Simpson penned another comment under yet another shirtless Renner post. </p>



<p>In his video, he was doing ab circuits alongside his mother.</p>



<p>“I love this oh my … Mama is STRONG … I need to go do sit ups now,&#8221; Simpson commented.</p>



<p>Additionally, she has been handing out &#8220;likes&#8221; to nearly all of the actor&#8217;s posts since late January.</p>

<p>When Jessica Simpson released her new EP, <em>Nashville Canyon, Pt. 1</em>, it was his turn to leave a comment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congrats Jess!!!&#8221; Jeremy Renner wrote with apparent enthusiasm.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not the same as <em>hooting and hollering</em> or peppering her comments with thirsty emojis, but it&#8217;s definitely <em>friendly</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-re-not-a-couple-yet">They&#8217;re not a couple &#8230; yet</h2>



<p>Can Jessica Simpson do much better for herself than the actor that some have labeled<em> Temu Robin Hood</em>? Yes. (And yes, that is harsher than calling Stephen Amell &#8220;Walmart Batman&#8221; a decade ago)</p>



<p>But that has really always been true with the men of her past. Including her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jessica-simpson-hints-that-eric-johnson-cheated-in-new-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent ex</a>.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s an extraordinary woman who bore the brunt of so much rancid misogyny and body-shaming that truly <em>peaked </em>when she rose to fame.</p>



<p>If this is really what Simpson wants for herself, then more power to her. I guess.</p>

<p>Jeremy Renner is lucky to be alive.</p>



<p>And he knows it.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, the Marvel Cinematic Universe star spoke out for the first time since getting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/jeremy-renner-still-in-critical-condition-following-life-threatening-snow-plow-accident/">severely injured over the weekend in a snowplow accident</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you all for your kind words. Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all,&#8221; the actor wrote as a caption to the selfie below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jeremy Renner is recovering from a serious snowplow accident. We wish him the best.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can tell, the photo was snapped from a hospital bed.</p>



<p>Renner sustained blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries after being involved in the aforementioned incident on his property in Reno, Nevada, on Sunday, January 1.</p>



<p>He was airlifted to a hospital and underwent surgery the following day.</p>



<p>Afterward, the veteran actor remained in the intensive care unit &#8230; in critical but stable condition.</p>

<p>During a press conference yesterday, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam explained that Renner was helping a family member get a &#8220;stuck&#8221; vehicle out of about three feet of snowfall from the evening before.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Renner went to retrieve his PistenBully, or snowcat — an extremely large piece of snow-removal equipment weighing at least 14,330 pounds — in an effort to get his vehicle moving. After successfully towing his personal vehicle from its stuck location, Mr. Renner got out of his PistenBully to speak to his family member,&#8221; said Balaam.</p>



<p>&#8220;At this point, it is observed that the PistenBully started to roll. </p>



<p>&#8220;In an effort to stop the rolling PistenBully, Mr. Renner attempts to get back into the driver&#8217;s seat of the PistenBully. </p>



<p>&#8220;Based on our investigation, it&#8217;s at this point that Mr. Renner is run over by the PistenBully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Balaam added that &#8220;at this point in the investigation we do not believe Mr. Renner was impaired at all, and we believe this is a tragic accident.</p>



<p>&#8220;The investigation is ongoing, however, we do not suspect any foul play. I&#8217;ll repeat that: We do not suspect any foul play. We believe this was a tragic accident.&#8221;</p>



<p>In an earlier statement, Renner&#8217;s rep said the following: </p>



<p>&#8220;Jeremy&#8217;s family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible doctors and nurses looking after him, Truckee Meadows Fire and Rescue, Washoe County Sheriff, Reno City Mayor Hillary Schieve and the Carano and Murdock families. </p>



<p>&#8220;They are also tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new year got off to a terrifying start for actor Jeremy Renner, who very nearly lost his life in an accident involving a snow plow over the weekend.</p>



<p>Specifics regarding the accident and the exact nature of Renner&#8217;s injuries remain unclear, but we know that the 51-year-old has undergone surgery and is still in critical condition.</p>



<p>News of the accident instantly made Renner a top trending topic on Twitter.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;ll need that support from fans as he begins what&#8217;s sure to be a long and painful recovery process.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://people.com/movies/jeremy-renner-out-of-surgery-after-suffering-blunt-chest-trauma-and-orthopedic-injuries-from-accident/">a statement</a> issued to <em>People</em> magazine on Monday, Renner&#8217;s reps offered a more detailed update that sadly provides little reason for immediate hope.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can confirm that Jeremy has suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries and has undergone surgery today, January 2nd 2023,&#8221; the reps revealed.</p>



<p>&#8220;He has returned from surgery and remains in the intensive care unit in critical but stable condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Best known for his work as Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Renner has received acclaim for his performances in a wide array of lesser-known projects, including the Oscar-winning Iraq War drama <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, and the current Showtime series <em>The Mayor of Kingstown</em>.</p>



<p>Authorities have confirmed that Renner was the only one involved in the New Year&#8217;s Day accident.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear, however, if he was run over by his own snowplow, as initial reports indicated.</p>
