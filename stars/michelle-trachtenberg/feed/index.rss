<p>Michelle Trachtenberg tragically passed away last week.</p>



<p>Many of her fans and former costars are still in shock. This was so unexpected.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Oscars</a> have come and gone with relatively few surprises in the mix.</p>



<p>But this year&#8217;s In Memoriam segment of the Oscars snubbed Trachtenberg. And she was not the only conspicuous exclusion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="708" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-708x1024.jpg" alt="Michelle Trachtenberg on February 9, 2020." class="wp-image-520483" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-708x1024.jpg 708w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-208x300.jpg 208w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-768x1110.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-1417x2048.jpg 1417w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-664x960.jpg 664w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-747x1080.jpg 747w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-830x1200.jpg 830w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-scaled.jpg 1771w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Trachtenberg attends the 28th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party sponsored by IMDb, Neuro Drinks and Walmart on February 09, 2020.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-michelle-trachtenberg-not-appear-in-the-oscars-in-memoriam-tribute">Why did Michelle Trachtenberg not appear in the Oscars &#8216;In Memoriam&#8217; tribute?</h2>



<p>On Sunday, March 3, the 2025 Oscars telecast included the familiar tribute to deceased stars &#8212; and a few others from within the film industry &#8212; who have died over the past year.</p>



<p>The segment used the &#8220;Lacrimosa&#8221; section from Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Requiem in D Minor,&#8221; which is often a tasteful decision.</p>



<p>Late titans of the entertainment industry like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/david-lynch-cause-of-death-iconic-film-director-twin-peaks-creator-passes-away-at-78/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lynch</a>, Dame Maggie Smith, Shelley Duvall, James Earl Jones, Donald Sutherland, and even Gene Hackman &#8212; whose tragic death was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-wife-and-dog-found-dead-in-santa-fe-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered last week</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Michelle Trachtenberg on October 23, 2017." class="wp-image-520482" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Trachtenberg attends the Third Annual &#8220;InStyle Awards&#8221;  presented by InStyle at The Getty Center on October 23, 2017.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for InStyle)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It did seem odd to some viewers that Michelle Trachtenberg did not make the In Memoriam segment.</p>



<p>After all, she had an extensive filmography. Though she died at only 39, she had been a child actress and thus worked for decades.</p>



<p>Certainly, many <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-michelle-trachtenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-list actors knew her</a>. People attending the Oscars had known her for years or even decades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-news-of-michelle-trachtenberg-dying-just-too-last-minute">Was news of Michelle Trachtenberg dying just too last minute?</h2>



<p>News of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-final-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s passing</a> broke hours <em>before </em>the discover of Gene Hackman and his wife (and one of their dogs) dead in their Santa Fe home.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that most people are more familiar with Trachtenberg&#8217;s work in things like <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em> and <em>Gossip Girl </em>than in films like <em>Mysterious Skin</em> or <em>Black Christmas</em>. Gene Hackman was famous specifically for his film work.</p>



<p>But many would argue that Alec Baldwin is now more famous for his television work than in film &#8212; but if he passed, he would be unlikely to receive a snub like this.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="775" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-1024x775.jpg" alt="The legendary Tony Todd on August 10, 2011." class="wp-image-520484" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-300x227.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-768x581.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-2048x1549.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-960x726.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-1080x817.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_tonytodd_01-1200x908.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actor Tony Todd arrives at a screening of New Line Cinema&#8217;s &#8220;Final Destination 5&#8221; at the Chinese Theater on August 10, 2011.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There were other snubs at the Oscars In Memoriam segment.</p>



<p>One particularly notable one was Tony Todd. Many of us know this actor from his science fiction work, like <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, and <em>Babylon 5: A Call To Arms</em>.</p>



<p>But, in addition to these live action television work and to his phenomenal voice acting (he had a <em>very </em>distinctive voice), Todd was perhaps best known for his work in the horror genre. It was strange to many to see him not receive a tribute, even if he worked in a genre that is sometimes disparaged.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Shannen Doherty on January 18, 2018." class="wp-image-520485" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_shannendoherty_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Shannen Doherty attends Paramount Network Launch Party at Sunset Tower on January 18, 2018.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Earl Gibson III/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-behind-oscars-in-memoriam-snubs">What&#8217;s behind Oscars In Memoriam snubs?</h2>



<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/shannen-doherty-cause-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannen Doherty passed away</a> in the summer of 2024 after an extended battle with cancer.</p>



<p>Like Michelle Trachtenberg and Tony Todd, many associated her more strongly with her television work.</p>



<p>But she was also in <em>Mall Rats</em>, <em>Heathers</em>, and other classic films. Her exclusion from the Oscars In Memoriam felt <em>weird</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Oscars In Memoriam screen on March 2, 2025." class="wp-image-520481" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In Memoriam is shown during the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps we should all keep in mind that decisions like the Oscars In Memoriam tribute are deeply political. We don&#8217;t mean in terms of political partisanship, but rather in terms of who receives honors at the Oscars specifically in contrast with who is considered a &#8220;different&#8221; type of actor. </p>



<p>Clearly, Michelle Trachtenberg, Shannen Doherty, and Tony Todd did not fit someone&#8217;s idea of iconic actors. That&#8217;s sad.</p>



<p>But look, if you&#8217;ve ever read what Oscars voters actually think about films, you come to understand the thinking behind these awards. </p>

<p>Blake Lively is remembering Michelle Trachtenberg in the wake of the iconic actress&#8217; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-dead-at-39/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking death</a>.</p>



<p>While fans pore over <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-final-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trachtenberg&#8217;s final posts</a> for clues, Lively actually knew her.</p>



<p>Lively rose to fame starring as Serena van der Woodsen on <em>Gossip Girl</em>. Trachtenberg portrayed recurring antagonist Georgina Sparks. She even reprised the role on the reboot.</p>



<p>Trachtenberg wasn&#8217;t just a generational star to Lively. She was a friend and co-star.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the millions reeling in shock at the sudden passing of Michelle Trachtenberg, Blake Lively actually knew her. As she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-dead-at-39-stars-react-to-stunning-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reacted</a> to the tragic news, her memories came from behind the scenes &#8212; not from a screen.</p>



<p>“This is the first day I met Michelle,” Lively wrote on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blakelively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story on Wednesday alongside a photo of the two.</p>



<p>“She was electricity. You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed,&#8221; she characterized. &#8220;Everything she did, she did 200%.”</p>

<p>“She laughed the fullest at someone’s joke, she faced authority head-on when she felt something was wrong,&#8221; Blake Lively praised of Michelle Trachtenberg. </p>



<p>&#8220;She cared deeply about her work,&#8221; she affirmed.</p>



<p>Lively added: &#8220;She was proud to be a part of this community and industry as painful as it could be sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake Lively went on to describe the late Michelle Trachtenberg as she remembers her.</p>



<p>She praised her former co-star as having been “fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved.”</p>



<p>Growing more specific, Lively recalled how Trachtenberg carried caramel lipgloss because she &#8220;cared about the sweet details.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on October 28, 2024." class="wp-image-520246" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the 2024 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on October 28, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Time passes,” Blake Lively somberly acknowledged. “You take for granted that you get the chance to see an old friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;To paraphrase, the real tragedies in life are the ones that blindside you on an idle Tuesday.” That line seems to be paraphrasing Mary Schmich, specifically.</p>



<p>“The world lost a deeply sensitive and good person in Michelle,&#8221; Lively concluded. &#8220;May her work and her huge heart be remembered by those who were lucky enough to experience her fire.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-still-so-much-that-we-do-not-know">There is still so much that we do not know</h2>



<p>As we reported on Wednesday, Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s mother discovered her early in the morning that day. </p>



<p>The 39-year-old actress had reportedly gone into cardiac arrest. First responders declared her dead at the scene.</p>



<p>We still do not know the cause of death. News that she had reportedly received a liver transplant fairly recently has led people to make many guesses &#8212; without confirmation.</p>



<p>For now, all that we can do is mourn her passing. Michelle Trachtenberg entertained an entire generation from childhood and into adulthood.</p>

<p>As you may have heard by now, tragedy has once again struck Hollywood:</p>



<p>Michelle Trachtenberg, an actress best known for roles on Gossip Girl and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-dead-at-39/">passed away at a very young age</a>. She was only 39 years old.</p>



<p>The star was found &#8220;unconscious and unresponsive&#8221; by her mother on the morning of Wednesday, February 26, according to various sources.</p>



<p>A cause of death has not been confirmed, although Trachtenberg had recently undergone a liver transplant.</p>

<p>&#8220;EMS responded to the location and pronounced the victim deceased,&#8221; NYPD said on Wednesday. &#8220;Criminality is not suspected. The Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death. The investigation remains ongoing.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to this horrible news, a number of celebrities have taken to social media in order to pay respects to Michele Trachtenberg, who alarmed followers <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-final-posts/">with her final Instagram post</a>.</p>



<p>For example, Gossip Girl cast member Ed Westwick wrote: &#8220;So sad to hear of the passing of @michelletrachtenberg. Sending prayers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell, who appeared opposite the actress in the film Harriet the Spy, added: “Heartbreaking. I loved her very much. She struggled the last few years. I wish I could have helped.”</p>

<p>There was this from Melissa Gilbert: “Oh Michy…and we lived so close to one another. My heart aches for your family and all those who loved you so… @michelletrachtenberg #ripsweetgirl.”</p>



<p>And this from David Boreanaz: “So very sad… horrible news. R.I.P. and prayers to her and her family.”</p>



<p>Melissa Joan Hart wrote:</p>



<p>“I’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of @michelletrachtenberg!! So young, so talented and so sweet! Here is a fun scene from when she was on #ClarissaExplainsItAll. I think this was about 1992 and the episode was an idea I had about babysitting a total nightmare. But Michelle was nothing like her character and even this young, we got along wonderfully. #gonetoosoon #RIP #GodBlesstheFunnyPeople.”</p>

<p>James Marsters: “My heart is heavy today. We have lost a beautiful soul,” the Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor wrote via Instagram. “Michelle was fiercely intelligent, howlingly funny, and a very talented person. She died much too young, and leaves behind scores of people who knew and loved her. My heart goes out to her family who are good people, and are suffering the greatest loss anyone could bear. I hope everyone can give them space to heal in this most difficult time. Godspeed Michelle. You are missed.”</p>

<p>Before the end, Michelle Trachtenberg shared posts to social media that alarmed fans.</p>



<p>Early on Wednesday, February 26, the beloved 39-year-old actress was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-dead-at-39/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found dead</a> by her mother. </p>



<p>Her death was not deemed suspicious by investigators. But her cause of death was not announced, either.</p>



<p>While the world reels from this tragic and shocking news, some fans point to Trachtenberg&#8217;s final social media posts. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-trachtenberg-has-died">Michelle Trachtenberg has died</h2>



<p>As we reported earlier today, Michelle Trachtenberg has tragically passed away at the age of 39.</p>



<p>Her mother discovered her body at around 8 AM on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>Trachtenberg was a child actress who moved on to adult projects alongside her viewing audience. She went from <em>Harriet The Spy</em> to <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/02/michelle-trachtenberg-agrees-joss-whedon-is-the-worst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a></em> to <em>Gossip Girl</em>, alongside countless other acting roles.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="731" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-731x1024.jpg" alt="Michelle Trachtenberg on February 17, 2015." class="wp-image-520213" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-731x1024.jpg 731w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-1463x2048.jpg 1463w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-686x960.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-771x1080.jpg 771w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-857x1200.jpg 857w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_michelletrachtenberg_06-scaled.jpg 1829w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Michelle Trachtenberg backstage at the Naeem Khan fashion show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2015  at The Theatre at Lincoln Center on February 17, 2015.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>At the time of Trachtenberg&#8217;s death becoming public, her cause of death had not been identified.</p>



<p>Officially, the only piece of health-related news that we have about her is that she had reportedly undergone a liver transplant recently. </p>



<p>We do not have confirmation that this is related to her passing. All that we really know is that investigators do not consider her death to be suspicious.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-trachtenberg-s-final-posts-may-hold-clues-fans-believe">Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s final posts may hold clues, fans believe</h2>



<p>The 39-year-old actress&#8217; final post to Instagram was a throwback photo. Specifically, of herself on the red carpet in 2013 wearing a gorgeous green dress.</p>



<p>(The photo just above, from the <em>Killing Kennedy</em> premiere? It&#8217;s that outfit)</p>



<p>When Trachtenberg shared the throwback snap on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michelletrachtenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, she also included the caption: &#8220;I wanted to look like naughty #tinkerbelI.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other posts by Michelle Trachtenberg from the week before she died included various other throwbacks photos.</p>



<p>Each has simple captions, one referring to the &#8220;Sunday scaries.&#8221; Most seemed to have elements of nostalgia.</p>



<p>It is unclear if Trachtenberg was catering to followers &#8212; many of whom watched her on television growing up and in their own early adulthoods. She may have also been avoiding negative reactions to more recent photos.</p>

<p>For the final year or so of Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s life, she found herself dodging concerned fan questions regarding her appearance. </p>



<p>She clapped back more than once, reminding fans that she is no longer the 14-year-old whom they likely first saw. Most 39-year-olds look different than their teenage selves.</p>



<p>Of course, her tragic death at such a shockingly young age &#8212; and the news about her liver transplant &#8212; has fans wondering if they were right to worry about her health. Regardless, we are all in mourning.</p>

<p>Michelle Trachtenberg helped to define the Millennial generation, appearing on television and film across the course of her own childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. And thus keeping pace with others of her generation.</p>



<p><em>Harriet The Spy</em> is a &#8217;90s classic. She starred on about half of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/02/michelle-trachtenberg-agrees-joss-whedon-is-the-worst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a></em>. And she was one of <em>Gossip Girl</em>&#8216;s best antagonists. (Trachtenberg even reprised her role for the reboot!)</p>



<p>In fact, she has a sprawling filmography. One notable role was in the coming-of-age film, <em>Mysterious Skin</em>. Not a happy story, but it&#8217;s an excellent movie.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-was-michelle-trachtenberg-s-cause-of-death">What was Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s cause of death?</h2>



<p>Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s cause of death remains unknown at the time. This is still breaking news.</p>



<p>However, we do know that the 39-year-old actress had alarmed some of her own fans in recent months. Over the past year, really.</p>



<p>Some of her selfies had shown Trachtenberg appearing both gaunt and frail. It happened enough that many fans no longer believed that it was merely lighting or a weird angle.</p>

<p>When fans left concerned comments under her photos, Trachtenberg clapped back at people she perceived to be &#8220;haters&#8221; and trolls.</p>



<p>&#8220;Explain to me how I look sick,&#8221; she challenged her followers. She also clapped back at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/michelle-trachtenberg-plastic-surgery-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plastic surgery rumors</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you lose a calendar and not realize I’m not 14. I’m 38,&#8221; Trachtenberg wrote at the time. &#8220;How sad for you to leave such a comment.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-was-one-other-health-detail">There was one other health detail</h2>



<p>Though we do not know the reason for it or the precise timeline, Michelle Trachtenberg had recently undergone a liver transplant.</p>



<p>We would be irresponsible in claiming that this was a factor in her death. But many are assuming that it could have some connection to her tragic death, given that it is the only known health factor in recent years.</p>



<p>Our hearts go out to her loved ones who are grieving her at this time. We hope that they know that millions are mourning in their own way as they read this shocking news.</p>

<p>Has Michelle Trachtenberg had plastic surgery?</p>



<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s none of our business!</p>



<p>When the <em>Buffy</em> star posted a harmless selfie on Instagram earlier this week, she probably didn&#8217;t imagine that she&#8217;d wind up on the receiving end of thousands of unkind comments about her appearance.</p>



<p>Some folks chimed in with comments of concern; some your run of the mill trolling</p>



<p>Obviously, that response is not cool, and while we&#8217;ll concede that the former child star looks quite different than she did during her years in the spotlight &#8212; who doesn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ll let Michelle speak for herself. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-trachtenberg-on-plastic-surgery-happy-and-healthy">Michelle Trachtenberg on Plastic Surgery: &#8220;Happy and Healthy&#8221;</h2>



<p>Best known for her work as a child and teen star in such projects as <em>Harriet the Spy</em> and <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, Trachtenberg hasn&#8217;t worked much in recent years, but she&#8217;s remained active on social media.</p>



<p>However, most of her social media content consists of throwback photos and memes.</p>



<p>Until the last few weeks. Michelle&#8217;s been posting quite a few new selfies recently. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, she posted on that was the first time in quite a while that fans glimpsed an unfiltered, recent photo of her face.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Trachtenberg responded to the outpouring of concern (and criticism) with several more selfies, one of which came with the following caption:</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve received several comments recently about my appearance. I have never had plastic surgery I am happy and healthy. Check yourself haters.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some commenters replied with insults, saying she looked &#8220;unrecognizable.  Others insisted that they were just looking out for Michelle&#8217;s best interests.</p>

<p>To be fair, the last place anyone should be seeking medical advice is the comment section of their Instagram feed.</p>



<p>And as Michelle has always been very forthcoming about what&#8217;s going on in her life &#8212; more on that in a minute &#8212; we don&#8217;t see any reason not to take her at her word that everything&#8217;s on the up and up. </p>



<p>However, if anything is going on, here&#8217;s hoping seeing the messages of true concern from fans resonate with her. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-s-childhood-amp-the-buffy-years">Michelle&#8217;s Childhood &amp; The Buffy Years </h2>



<p>Like many child stars, Michelle has spoken out about being mistreated by predatory adults early in her career.</p>



<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/02/michelle-trachtenberg-agrees-joss-whedon-is-the-worst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trachtenberg has criticized Buffy creator Joss Whedon</a>.</p>



<p>After co-stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Charisma Carpenter accused Whedon of abusive behavior on set, Trachtenberg echoed their claims.</p>



<p>“I am brave enough now as a 35 year old woman … To repost this. Because. This must. Be known. As a teenager. With his not appropriate behavior … very. Not. Appropriate,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram in 2021.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;So now. People know. What Joss. Did.&#8221;</p>



<p>We mention this to remind everyone that their worst fears might be accurate &#8212; Trachtenberg may be coping with addiction or self-harm issues.</p>



<p>And those problems could be the result of childhood trauma or some other difficulty about which we know nothing.</p>



<p>So even if you&#8217;re worried about Michelle, it might be best to just keep your comments to yourself.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure she knows more about her own life and challenges than you do.</p>

<p>On Wednesday,&nbsp;<a href="/2021/02/joss-whedon-accused-of-heinous-misconduct-abuse-of-power/">Carpenter released a lengthy statement</a> that revealed all the horrible ways in which Whedon treated her back when the actress starred on Buffy the Vampire Diaries, as well as its spinoff, Angel.</p>
<p>&quot;For nearly two decades, I have held my tongue and made excuses for certain events that traumatize me to this day,&quot; wrote Carpenter.</p>
<p>&quot;Joss Whedon abused his power on numerous occasions while working together on the sets of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.</p>
<p>&quot;While he found his misconduct amusing, it only served to intensify my performance anxiety, disempower me and alienate me from my peers.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Carpenter appeared as Cordelia Chase on Buffy the Vampire Slayer from 1997 through 1999 and then on Angel until 2004.</p>
<p>She claimed yesterday that Whedon would regularly issue &quot;passive-aggressive threats to fire&quot; her and would make public, disparaging comments about her weight in front of fellow coworkers.</p>
<p>She said he would make her report to set at 1 a.m. just to mess with her &#8212; and it sadly worked.</p>
<p>&quot;The disturbing incidents triggered a chronic physical condition from which I still suffer,&quot; said&nbsp;Carpenter.</p>
<p>&quot;It is with a beating, heavy heart that I say I coped in isolation and, at times, destructively.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Why did the actress not speak out at the time?</p>
<p>She felt &quot;powerless and alone,&quot; Carpenter admitted, stating on Instagram:&nbsp;&quot;With no other option, I swallowed the mistreatment and carried on.&quot;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, actor Ray Fisher came forward last year with allegations against Whedon, alleging the director &quot;was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable&quot; while they worked together on Justice League in 2017.</p>
<p>Carpenter played a role in the internal investigation that followed &#8212; and says now that she was inspired by Fisher&#8217;s bravery.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;With tears welling, I feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility to Ray and others for remaining private about my experience with Joss and the suffering it has caused me,&quot; Carpenter wrote, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It is abundantly evident that Joss has persisted in his harmful actions, continuing to create wreckage in his wake.&quot;</p>
<p>Following Carpenter&#8217;s statement this week, Sarah Michelle Gellar echoed her former co-stars sentiments.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The veteran star, who portrayed the title character on Buffy the Vampire Diaries, wrote on social media:</p>
<p><strong><em>While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don&rsquo;t want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I am more focused on raising my family and surviving a pandemic currently so I will not be making any further statements at this time. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>But I stand with all survivors of abuse and I&rsquo;m proud of them for speaking out.</em></strong></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And now&nbsp;Trachtenberg has also sided with these actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you @sarahmgellar for saying this,&rdquo; Trachtenberg wrote in a post, including the above message on her personal Instagram page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am brave enough now as a 35 year old woman &hellip; To repost this. Because. This must. Be known. As a teenager. With his not appropriate behavior &hellip; very. Not. Appropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;So now. People know. What Joss. Did.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Trachtenberg played Gellar&rsquo;s sister Dawn Summers on the show from 2000 to 2003, when she was 15 to 18 years old.</p>
<p>Amber Benson, meanwhile, who played Tara on the same series, also added her own experience on the set of the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffy was a toxic environment and it starts at the top,&rdquo; the 44-year-old Tweeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a lot of damage done during that time and many of us are still processing it twenty plus years later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whedon has not yet commented on these new allegations.</p>
<p>But we hope he never works in Hollywood again.</p>
<p>Not. Ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you believe it&#8217;s been 13 entire years since a new episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer graced our television sets?</p><p>Sure, we&#8217;ve survived these long, cold years without new Sunnydale adventures with the comics, countless Netflix marathons, and the memories, but it&#8217;s been rough.</p><p>So let&#8217;s take a few moments to look back at this beloved show, to look at the main cast members and see what they&#8217;re up to now.</p><p>Come on. You know you want to.</p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">1</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar of course played the title role of Buffy Summers, the best darn vampire slayer that ever was. Sure, she died a couple times, but she came back to save the world, again and again. These days, Sarah is still acting, most recently in the animated series Star Wars Rebels. She&#8217;s also married to Freddie Prinze Jr.!</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Alyson Hannigan</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">2</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Alyson Hannigan played the role of Willow, a shy nerd turned powerful witch. Alyson went on to star in another delightful television series, How I Met Your Mother, and she&#8217;s married to Alexis Denishof, who hilariously played a Watcher named Wesley Wyndam-Pryce in both Buffy and Angel.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Nicholas Brendon</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">3</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Nicholas Brendon played Xander, and oh, he played him so very well. Unfortunately, Nicholas has struggled since the show ended. He&#8217;s been arrested multiple times for charges stemming from his addiction issues.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Anthony Stewart Head</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">4</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Anthony Stewart Head played Giles, and while he started off as Buffy&#8217;s high school librarian and her Watcher, by the time the series was over he was definitely a father figure to her. Anthony&#8217;s been acting steadily since the show ended, notably in the television series Merlin. And yeah, he&#8217;s still oddly attracttive.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>David Boreanaz</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">5</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>David Boreanaz played Angel, Buffy&#8217;s one true love (sorry, Spike fans). He&#8217;s been one of the more successful cast  members, since he&#8217;s starred in Bones for the past century (or since 2005, same thing).</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Charisma Carpenter</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">6</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Charisma Carpenter played Cordelia, the queen bee of Sunnydale High who eventually became one of the Scooby gang. She went on to play the same role in Angel, and she&#8217;s been acting ever since. One of her best roles, honestly, was in a Lifetime movie called Deadly Sibling Rivalry (for real) in which she played a pair of twins (for real).</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>James Marsters</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">7</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>James Marsters played Spike, who was probably the best character on the show, let&#8217;s be real. James played Spike again on Angel, and he&#8217;s acted since on shows like the Hawaii Five-0 reboot, Smallville, and Witches of East End.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Michelle Trachtenberg</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">8</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Michelle Trachtenberg played Dawn, Buffy&#8217;s little sister who turned out to be The Key (spoiler alert, sorry). This was hardly her first role &#8212; she starred in Harriet the Spy and was on The Adventures of Pete and Pete, to name a couple of early gigs &#8212; and it wasn&#8217;t her last, either. Her later roles include roles on Weeds, Mercy, and Gossip Girl.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Eliza Dushku</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">9</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Eliza Dushku was the hot but villainous slayer known as Faith. She was Buffy&#8217;s friend for a while, but then &#8230; well, things weren&#8217;t five-by-five for long, if you know what we mean. Eliza&#8217;s also been very successful since Buffy: she got her own series, Tru Calling, and she starred in another Joss Whedon project, Dollhouse.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Emma Caulfield</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">10</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Emma Caulfield was the extremely lovable Anya, a vengeance demon who turned human. While Anya tragically died in the series finale, her spirit lives on. And so does Emma&#8217;s greatness: she&#8217;s been on shows like Gigantic, Once Upon a Time, and Royal Pains.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Amber Benson</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">11</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Amber Benson played Tara, a witch who won Willow&#8217;s heart before ultimately dying after being shot by creepy old Warren. Amber&#8217;s had plenty of smaller roles since her time as Tara came to end &#8212; including a hilarious guest spot on Supernatural, where she played a vampire.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Seth Green</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">12</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Seth Green was Oz, Willow&#8217;s high school boyfriend who was also a werewolf. He broke Willow&#8217;s heart by getting it on with a lady werewolf, then he went off to find himself or whatever, but really Seth went off to continue his extremely successful career. He created the popular series Robot Chicken, and he&#8217;s voiced countless roles in TV shows and video games.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Juliet Landau</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">13</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Juliet Landau played the amazing Drusilla, Spike&#8217;s absolutely insane girlfriend. After Buffy, Juliet turned her focus mainly to voice acting and theatre work, but she&#8217;s still just as lovely as ever.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Marc Blucas</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">14</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Marc Blucas played Riley Finn, Buffy&#8217;s longtime boyfriend and member of The Initiative, the government operation that studied vampires and demons and the like. Riley got into a bad place and ended up letting vampires suck his blood and then left on a helicopter because Buffy didn&#8217;t love him enough (???), but Marc went on to have a successful career, including a costarring role in First Daughter with Katie Holmes, so who&#8217;s the real winner? </p></figure></figure>

<p>And it goes something like this&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8230; <em><strong>XOXO</strong></em>!</p>
<p>The veteran actress threw it way back on social media yesterday, sharing a photograph of herself, Penn Badgley and Chace Crawford on the Gossip Girl set.</p>
<p>&quot;#tbt One of my favorite pics behind the scenes of #gossipgirl with these two handsome gents. #trouble #georginasparks,&quot; she captioned the picture. &quot;#xoxo.&quot;</p>
<p>As she mentions here,&nbsp;Trachtenberg recurred as Georgina Sparks for many seasons of the former CW smash.</p>
<p>It was never really clear whether Sparks was a friend or a foe to heroes such as Dan (Badgley) and Nate (Crawford), but she&#8217;s perpetually our pal for posting this image.</p>
<p>What can we say?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re Upper East Siders at heart.</p>

<p>Crawford, Trachtenberg, Jessica Szohr and Kelly Rutherford hung out at Elton John&#8217;s AIDS Foundation Oscars Party last year, <a href="/2015/02/gossip-girl-cast-reunites-at-oscars-viewing-party-omfg/">snapping another memorable photo</a> to document their mini reunion at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;So happy to see these beautiful people (inside and out) last night. Chase, Michelle and Jessica #GG #PostOscars,&quot; Rutherford wrote on Instagram as a caption.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, meanwhile, Blake Lively also went all awesome throwback on us.</p>
<p>She shared a picture of herself as a child with Jason Priestley and it may be <a href="/2015/12/blake-lively-posts-number-tbt-pic-of-when-she-and-brandon-walsh/">the best thing we&#8217;ve ever seen</a> in our entire lives.</p>
<p><em>SIGH</em>. Can The CW just air a Gossip Girl reunion already or what?!?</p>
<p>Oh well. At least we can always <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/gossip-girl/full-episodes/">watch Gossip Girl online</a> via TV Fanatic.&nbsp;</p>
