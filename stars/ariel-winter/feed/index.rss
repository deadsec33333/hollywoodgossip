										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Here&#8217;s a list of things that have gone on much longer than we expected:</p>
<p>1. <em>Modern Family</em>&#8216;s 47-year run on ABC, 2. <a href="/2017/09/ariel-winter-pens-open-letter-to-levi-meaden-on-his-30th-birthda/">Ariel Winter&#8217;s 3-year relationship with Levi Meaden</a> &#8230; we guess that&#8217;s the whole list.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing inherently bad about either of those things.</p>
<p>They just both elicit the same reaction when you&#8217;re reminded of them while scrolling through your channel guide or Instagram feed &#8212; namely, that&#8217;s still going on?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>But while <em>Modern Family</em> will still be with us many years from now, when TV is a serum you inject into your spinal cord and most modern families include at least one AI stepparent, the Ariel-Levi train has officially come to a stop.</p>
<p>Not only that, it seems she may have kicked Levi to the curb in favor of a younger guy!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Insiders tell Hollywood Life that Ariel was hooking up with actor Luke Benward soon after parting ways with Levi.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s widely suspected that there was some overlap between the two relationships.</p>
<p>&quot;There was quite a big age difference between Ariel and her boyfriend Levi and she found herself being a homebody,&quot; says one source.</p>
<p>&quot;She really missed her friends and her old life which is why she&rsquo;s been hanging out with Luke so much.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, there was more than a decade separating Ariel and Levi, and while an 11-year age difference might not seem like a huge deal, when those ages are 21 and 32, it might mean that both partners are at very different points in their lives.</p>
<p>&quot;As time passed she realized that she and her boyfriend had less and less in common,&quot; the source says.</p>
<p>&quot;She felt like she didn&rsquo;t have a chance to see a lot of her old friends for a while while with Levi and she&rsquo;s loving getting that time back with them,&quot; the insider adds.</p>
<p>&quot;Her entire life was Levi.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As for Luke, he&#8217;s a 24-year-old actor best known for his work in the Netflix film <em>Dumplin&#8217;</em> and the Disney Channel series <em>Good Luck Charlie</em>.</p>
<p>He and Ariel have not confirmed that they&#8217;re dating but they appear to be <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/12/13/ariel-winter-spotted-getting-cozy-with-rumored-boyfriend-luke-benward/">more than friends in recent photos</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess how serious they are or how long these two will be together.</p>
<p>But whatever the case, you can be sure their relationship will be outlasted by the eternal juggernaut that is Modern Family by at least 3 or 4 millennia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Okay, so after years of hype, winter never really came to Westeros &#8212; but did it show up at a Malibu plastic surgeon&#8217;s office instead?</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s our extremely lame way of introducing the latest round of <a href="/2019/01/ariel-winter-claps-back-at-body-shamers-who-say-shes-too-skinny/">Ariel Winter plastic surgery</a> accusations.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Interest in Ariel&#8217;s sitcom may be dwindling as <em>Modern Family</em> wraps up its 47th season, but on social media, the actress&#8217; influence continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, accumulating 4 million Instagram followers means being subject to a LOT of scrutiny, and because social media in 2019 is basically an open manhole, all that attention is gonna result in a whole lot of hateful comments.</p>
<p>Sadly, Ariel is no stranger to body shaming, but fortunately, she typically wards off the trolls with surprising skill.</p>
<p>But this latest round of trash talk is surprisingly&nbsp;specific, and bullies who really put a lot of thought into their idiocy are often the most dangerous kind.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ariel looks different in some of her recent pics, but that&#8217;s only because of her Little Mermaid-hued locks.</p>
<p>(That name-appropriate comparison is hers, not ours. She captioned the above pic, &quot;part of yourrrrrr worrrrrld&quot;)</p>
<p>But some extremely-online jackass who fancies himself a celebrity sleuth believes there&#8217;s more to the story.</p>
<p>And thus, in what he probably considered some consummate act of d-bag bravery he &quot;called out&quot; Ariel and accused her of undergoing cosmetic surgery.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;How many surgeries have you had on your body and face now?&quot; sayeth the basement-dwelling goblin.</p>
<p>When other followers pointed out that <a href="/2016/02/ariel-winter-proudly-displays-breast-reduction-scars-on-red-carp/">Ariel has spoken openly about her breast reductions</a> and does not appear to have had any other work done, the troll presented his case in full:</p>
<p>&quot;Two breast reductions, that&#8217;s obvious, cheek bone and chin shaving and lip fillers. Pretty obvious, she looks so different #Truth,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>Wow. He used the #Truth hashtag, so it has to be true, right?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yeah, not so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ariel was quick to clap back and point out that nothing dude said has any basis in fact.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&#8217;t going to reply but I HAVE to ask&#8230;what the f&#8211;k is cheek bone and chin shaving????&quot; Winter remarked, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;re also wrong about all of it by the way. One breast reduction &amp; I lost weight but you do you boo.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s how you do it folks:</p>
<p>Keep your sense of humor intact, set the record straight, and move on.</p>
<p>Sure, there are times when it&#8217;s best to simply not acknowledge the haters at all.</p>
<p>But to paraphrase Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, sometimes it&#8217;s important to not take any guff from these swine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Ariel Winter rose to fame playing Alex Dunphy on<em> Modern Family</em>, which is currently in its 47th season on ABC.</p>
<p>(We kid, of course, but seriously &#8212; remember when shows used to end?)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Anyway, in the several decades since the show premiered, Ariel has managed to eclipse the series and escape the curse of the washed-up child star.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partially due to her work in a wide array of film and television projects.</p>
<p>And of course, Ariel&#8217;s candid comments about her difficult childhood and her decision to undergo <a href="/2016/02/ariel-winter-breast-reduction-surgery-changed-my-life/">breast reduction surgery</a> have endeared her to millions who have faced similar struggles.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But if we&#8217;re being completely honest, the real reason that Ariel has so flawlessly made the leap from ensemble actor to breakout star is her social media presence.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a euphemistic way of saying people really seem to enjoy<a href="/2017/02/ariel-winter-busted-photoshopping-bikini-pics-again/"> Ariel Winter bikini photos</a> &#8212; but she owes her popularity to much more than just her racy selfies.</p>
<p>Ariel is unashamed to bare all in much more important ways than showing off her figure.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Take her cover shoot for the new issue of<em> Pulse Spikes</em> magazine.</p>
<p>The extreme close-up image features an unretouched Ariel sporting minimal makeup.</p>
<p>The intention, of course, is to highlight not only Ariel&#8217;s natural beauty, but also her bravery.</p>

<p>Inside the mag, fans will find an interview that&#8217;s every bit as revealing as the photo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was definitely more of a difficult process for me,&rdquo; says the actress, who turned 21 last week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just something you think about like, &lsquo;Oh, well I am going to be photographed in this setting. Oh no, what if I look weird? I got a pimple today!&rsquo; But it was nice to be able to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ariel says she struggled with her self-image for years, and her anxiety was exacerbated by growing up in the spotlight.</p>
<p>She says it&#8217;s only in recent years that she came to the realization that obsessing over the perceptions of others is a sure path to chronic anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realized that it didn&rsquo;t matter&hellip; the only person that matters is me because I am the only one who has to live with me,&rdquo; she tells Pulse Spikes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Taking time to think about that and understand what is going on and why you feel that way, instead of brushing it aside, is important. Why live hating yourself when there is no real reason to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interview serves as a reminder that its Ariel&#8217;s forthright demeanor more than her famous figure that&#8217;s made her a household name.</p>
<p>That said, she&#8217;d probably leave a few million fans disappointed if she stopped documenting her trips to the beach.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>About half a year ago, <a href="/2018/07/ariel-winter-driven-off-of-twitter-by-hateful-harassment/">Ariel Winter quit Twitter</a> because she was inundated with so much hate from trolls.</p>
<p>Ariel is still seeing the hate on Instagram, especially from body-shamers who love to spread rumors.</p>
<p>This time, the haters think that she&#8217;s &quot;too skinny,&quot; but Ariel is clapping back.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Sunday, the day before she turned 21, Ariel Winter shared some photos with her best friend, fellow actor Joe Kaprielian.</p>
<p>In the photos, she is wearing a checkered jumpsuit.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s not skin tight, it&#8217;s not exactly a puffy winter coat. Her form is not very obscured.</p>
<p>When she shared the pics on Instagram, she certainly received some positive feedback.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;You look amazing,&quot; one fan gushed.</p>
<p>Others said the same, or wished her a preemptive happy birthday.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not everyone was so kind.</p>
<p>Body-shamers crawled out of the woodwork to tell Ariel that they don&#8217;t approve of her body&#8217;s shape.</p>
<p>&quot;Omg you lost your butt,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Another wrote: &quot;Too skinny now.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yet another added: &quot;I&rsquo;m sorry you felt the need to so dramatically change your appearance. I liked you just as you were. I hope you are happy in your new body though&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, whether you&#8217;re whining about someone gaining or losing weight, body-shaming is body-shaming.</p>
<p>Some fans of Ariel rose to her defense and argued back against the trolls.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing wrong with being honest and telling her we liked her better before &lsquo;the change,&rsquo;&quot; one commenter insisted.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She was so beautiful before she started chopping up her body,&quot; the body-shamer claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;And if me saying so helps one gurl out here to feel beautiful who&rsquo;s thinking of PS,&quot; the comment concluded. &quot;Its worth it.&quot;</p>
<p><em>PS</em>, in this case, refers to plastic surgery, which this body-shamer assumes that Ariel underwent to shrink her butt.</p>
<p>Ariel herself took notice of this particular comment &#8212; though who knows how many others she had to see.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To this one, perhaps because she felt this was someone who could be reached, Ariel replied.</p>
<p>&quot;I appreciate you wanting to help girls love themselves the way they are,&quot; Ariel began.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;You are also kind of cutting someone (me) down.&quot;</p>
<p>Holding someone up as a cautionary tale is absolutely cutting that person down.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ariel gave the commenter the benefit of the doubt, writing: &quot;which isn&rsquo;t what I think you were trying to do?&quot;</p>
<p>She also wanted to clear the air because there was definitely some misinformation in the comments.</p>
<p>&quot;I also didn&rsquo;t get plastic surgery,&quot; she clarified.</p>
<p>While she has been open about her breast reduction, she wants it to be clear that she hasn&#8217;t done anything recently.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;That is also not supportive of women,&quot; Ariel concluded. &quot;If you&rsquo;re just assuming about the way they look.&quot;</p>
<p>She is absolutely right.</p>
<p>Too many people think that body positivity only goes in one direction. It does not.</p>
<p>Ariel has been battling body-shamers since she was a very young actress.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Fans &#8212; including those who should really have known better &#8212; would talk about her breasts.</p>
<p>She eventually got a breast reduction and has been so, so much happier since then.</p>
<p>But even this month, she has had to clear the air against some brutally hateful rumors about her weight loss.</p>
<p>&quot;Not half as bad as all the coke/meth she uses,&quot; wrote some unspeakable troll. &quot;She literally dropped 30 pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>Ariel replied to that hater with some biting sarcasm.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;My psychiatrist switched me from my previous anti depressant that didn&rsquo;t work,&quot; Ariel began. &quot;And made me gain weight to coke/meth!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Definitely not a new one that worked and then regulated metabolism,&quot; she joked. &quot;Coke/meth was a controversial decision but she stands by it.&quot;</p>
<p>One, that is genuinely a funny way to reply. Two, you can really taste the venom in her words. Good. That anger is justified.</p>
<p>And three, of course: Ariel&#8217;s body&#8217;s shape and weight and how she attained them are none of anyone&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>Please just let people &#8230; exist.</p>
<p>Anyway, we hope that Ariel had a very happy birthday on Monday. 21 is the last good milestone so we hope that she&#8217;s living it up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>While Instagram is still happily showing <a href="/2018/07/ariel-winter-everyone-watch-my-boyfriend-grab-my-butt/">Ariel Winter getting her butt grabbed</a>, the <em>Modern Family</em> star has taken a step back from Twitter.</p>
<p>She is, at least, explaining her absence, but it&#8217;s not good news.</p>
<p>Ariel has been driven off of the social media platform because she is absolutely exhausted by the constant harassment. And she might drop Instagram next.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In <a href="https://www.etonline.com/ariel-winter-quits-twitter-after-constant-negativity-105612">a statement</a> to <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>, Ariel Winter&#8217;s rep explains why the <em>Modern Family</em> star has suddenly vanished from Twitter.</p>
<p>&quot;Ariel has taken a break from Twitter,&quot; the statement explains. &quot;And engaging with commenters on her other platforms.&quot;</p>
<p>You can engage with fans on just about any platform, but Twitter sometimes feels like nothing but that &#8212; and it can wear you out.</p>
<p>Ariel is stepping back &quot;because of the constant negativity she experiences,&quot; the statement says.</p>
<p>People on the internet can be cruel &#8212; especially if you are famous and <em>especially</em> if you are a woman.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She needs a moment to breathe and enjoy herself,&quot; the statement continues.</p>
<p>Of course. Everyone, no matter how famous, deserves that.</p>
<p>And the statement makes clear that Ariel wants to be able to live her life &quot;without judgement.&quot;</p>
<p>Good for her.</p>
<p>Ariel did not only speak up through her rep.</p>
<p>In her Instagram story, Ariel warned fans that she is &quot;in the process of deleting all social media.&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately, her Instagram remains up &#8212; for now.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Back in 2016, Ariel was singing a different tune when she <a href="https://www.etonline.com/news/195830_ariel_winter_on_her_risque_instagram_posts_and_body_image_positivity_everyone_has_a_butt">spoke to <em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a> about her use of social media.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;m telling myself, &#8216;You should post this, you shouldn&#8217;t post that,&#8217; I feel like I&#8217;m just having fun,&quot; Ariel said at the time.</p>
<p>She explained why she offered so many glimpses into her life, saying: &quot;I like my fans to see what I&#8217;m doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not going to fight with someone on my Instagram that tells me they don&#8217;t like my outfit or I should put my butt away,&quot; Ariel said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s her body and, within Instagram&#8217;s rules of use (which totally allow butts), she can share whatever photos of it she likes.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m sorry you think I should put my butt away,&quot; Ariel said in 2016. &quot;But just unfollow me.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That is good advice. Unfortunately, not advice that many people take.</p>
<p>Instead, there are certain trolls who thrive off of eliciting a reaction &#8212; especially a negative one &#8212; from famous women on the internet.</p>
<p>These trolls are drawn to beautiful women, but for some reason seem determined to shame these women for showing (or even having) the bodies that these trolls often admire.</p>
<p>Of course, these trolls may also tell beautiful women that they&#8217;re ugly, or say anything else to hurt that person&#8217;s self esteem.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense, but vicious cruelty on the internet doesn&#8217;t have to be logical to drive people from the internet.</p>
<p>Look at how <em>Star Wars</em> actress Kelly Marie Tran was driven from Instagram by harassment. And now, Ariel Winter&#8217;s been driven away from Twitter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We imagine that what&#8217;s changed for Ariel Winter since 2016 is that trolls are more emboldened than ever before. It&#8217;s also that she probably got tired of the hate.</p>
<p>What seems like a bracing difference of opinion at one point can get really old two years later.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ariel is happily in a relationship with Levi Meaden. A lot of hateful comments have been directed at their romance, at him, and his career.</p>
<p>It can be a lot harder to weather comments about someone you love than it is to see hate directed at you.</p>
<p>We hope that this well-deserved rest does Ariel a lot of good. We&#8217;ll certainly miss her tweets.</p>
