<p>Khloe Kardashian feels grossed out by Lamar Odom.</p>



<p>How much or how little <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Khloe interacts with her exes</a> is a perennial hot topic. These are men who have done her dirty.</p>



<p>In the case of her ex-husband, however, some of the violations have come <em>after </em>their split.</p>



<p>Khloe knows exactly how she feels about Lamar getting a lookalike RealDoll of her. Among other things, she feels like she (eventually) dodged a bullet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lamar-odom-got-a-khloe-kardashian-doll-last-year-and-it-doesn-t-go-on-a-shelf">Lamar Odom got a Khloe Kardashian doll last year, and it doesn&#8217;t go on a shelf</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, April 10 Season 6 finale of <em>The Kardashians</em>, Khloe Kardashian recovered just long enough from Kris Jenner&#8217;s abandonment to react to Lamar Odom and his &#8230; <em>collection</em>.</p>



<p>While visiting London, Kris brought up what she referred to as her former son-in-law&#8217;s &#8220;blow-up doll.&#8221;</p>



<p>Khloe and Kris then explained that they were referring to viral stories from last year about Lamar visiting the RealDoll factory in Vegas &#8230; and ordering one to resemble Khloe.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who said Lamar Odom is too old to play with dolls &#8230; &#39;cause he just ordered his own custom sex doll &#8212; and, he wants it to look like his ex Khloe Kardashian! 😖 Full article in bio! <a href="https://t.co/DqNOIjmkE4">pic.twitter.com/DqNOIjmkE4</a></p>&mdash; TMZ (@TMZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1854659166847267015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Keep in mind that, earlier in the episode, Khloe had been venting to Kendall and Kylie about her experiences with Lamar.</p>



<p>She had remarked about his inappropriate and overtly sexual overtures towards her, even though they were exes. </p>



<p>It also frustrated her that he, like Tristan, too often acted as if he had not wronged her.</p>



<p>Khloe, it turns out, had learned about Lamar getting a sex doll that resembles her the same way that everyone else had: through the internet. Yikes!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-has-strong-feelings-on-the-matter">She has strong feelings on the matter</h2>



<p>&#8220;I’m supposed to be flattered by this?&#8221; Khloe asked incredulously while addressing the confessional camera.</p>



<p>&#8220;This validates just how different we are,&#8221; she affirmed, &#8220;and how much we’ve grown apart.&#8221;</p>



<p>Khloe continued: &#8220;And it’s creepy and it’s weird but I’m not hurt by it. It’s his journey. It’s just weird and gross.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-1024x576.png" alt="Khloe Kardashian discusses emotional walls." class="wp-image-523159" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_thekardashians_02_khloekardashian.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Addressing the confessional camera on &#8216;The Kardashians&#8217; during the Season 6 finale, Khloe Kardashian discussed building up emotional walls.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Human sexuality is of course not gross. Neither is the use of sex toys, even unconventional ones.</p>



<p>However, designing a sex toy to resemble an ex without their consent is another matter. </p>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s a custom dildo mold or a high-end sex doll, there are limits to how much a sex toy should resemble a real person. Without their consent, that is.</p>



<p>Publicly getting a synthetic knockoff of your ex-wife is, at best, a cry for help. </p>



<p>Clearly, Khloe feels that Lamar&#8217;s behavior is only further convincing her that he belongs in her past. And she didn&#8217;t really need convincing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kris-jenner-had-her-own-take">Kris Jenner had her own take</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Momager Kris Jenner seemed to find the matter sad but harmless. In her mind, this was an &#8220;if it makes you happy&#8221; situation.</p>



<p>She spoke to the camera about resolving to, in 2025, be less judgmental of others. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear how well she is succeeding.</p>



<p>That said, she&#8217;s being remarkably chill about this compared to how many moms would react. Lamar&#8217;s fixation on his ex needs to end &#8230; even if he is, by far, not the worst Kardashian ex.</p>

<p>Lamar Odom apparently does not know the meaning behind the term <em><strong>TMI</strong></em>.</p>



<p>On the November 19 episode of the We&#8217;re Out of Time podcast, the former NBA forward revealed that he purchased a custom sex doll that resembled his ex-wife, Khloe Kardashian.</p>



<p>No, really.</p>



<p>We couldn&#8217;t make that up if we tried.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="705" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-1024x705.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513568" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-300x206.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-768x528.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-2048x1409.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-960x660.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-1080x743.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1624662293-1200x826.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom attends the 23rd annual Harold and Carole Pump Foundation Gala at The Beverly Hilton on August 18, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re really thinking about it, [it&#8217;s] like a doll,&#8221; Odom said on this podcast, explaining in further depth:</p>



<p>&#8220;But then you think about like, mental health, and how important that is, not just in today&#8217;s time, but just from the beginning of time. A sex doll that looks like your wife is about mental health.”</p>



<p>Hey, look. We&#8217;re all for mental health.</p>



<p>As long as you aren&#8217;t harming anybody else, you do you, people. Focus on your own happiness.</p>



<p>This just feels like a bit of a stretch to classify a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/khloe-kardashian/">Khloe Kardashian</a>-lookalike sex doll as anything based around mental health.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sick, but I think we&#8217;re all a little off, a little weird,&#8221; Odom added. “They&#8217;re gonna make it to look like her. I need like, a harem.”</p>



<p>Kardashian and Odom got married on September 27, 2009, just one month after they met.</p>



<p>Four years later, however, the marriage fell apart amid <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/lamar-odom-embarrassed-for-how-he-cheated-on-khloe-kardashian-im-laughing-at-myself/">Odom&#8217;s cheating scandal</a> and amid him having suffered a drug relapse. </p>



<p>Kardashian eventually went on to file for divorce that December.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513570" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1147944666-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom attends the Fashion Nova x Cardi B Collection Launch Party at Hollywood Palladium on May 8, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These days, Odom admits he and Kardashian don&#8217;t speak too much, but said &#8220;she still cares about me&#8221; and also said:</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t speak to her. I can text her and she&#8217;ll reply.&#8221;</p>



<p>Odom <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/lamar-odom-tells-all-in-sex-drugs-and-kardashians-doc-i-loved-crack-more-than-i-loved-khloe/">suffered a serious drug overdose</a> in October 2015.</p>



<p>Despite their history and their struggles as husband and wife, Khloe remained by her ex-spouse&#8217;s side throughout his recovery.</p>



<p>Once he was discharged, the two formalized their split in December 2016.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513572" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-937507944-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom attends Nickelodeon&#8217;s 2018 Kids&#8217; Choice Awards at The Forum on March 24, 2018 in Inglewood, California.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Odom has often referred to Kardashian as his soulmate and said in 2022 that he was gonna try his hardest to reconnect with the reality star.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would probably just want to take her to dinner,&#8221; Lamar shared in a confessional on Celebrity Big Brother. </p>



<p>&#8220;It would be a blessing just to be in her presence to just tell her I&#8217;m sorry and what a fool I was. She has the right to never see me again for the things I put her through, but time moves on and people change. </p>



<p>&#8220;I would say I&#8217;m a lot more loyal now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caitlyn Jenner and Lamar Odom are launching a podcast. No, this is not a joke.</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/caitlyn-jenner-joins-fox-news-as-network-ramps-up-anti-trans-tal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caitlyn Jenner joined Fox News</a> as the network ramped up its anti-trans talking points for the 2024 election cycle. Stacey Dash held a similar role for the 2016 cycle.</p>



<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/lamar-odom-tells-all-in-sex-drugs-and-kardashians-doc-i-loved-crack-more-than-i-loved-khloe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lamar Odom told all</a> in a documentary. He has lived a full and, at times, risk-filled life.</p>



<p>Neither athlete is a stranger to controversy or to fame. Or to sports.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caitlyn-jenner-and-lamar-odom-have-a-podcast">Caitlyn Jenner and Lamar Odom have a podcast</h2>



<p>On Monday, March 18, the world learned that Caitlyn Jenner and Lamar Odom are teaming up to launch <em>Keeping Up With Sports</em>. Ahead of their first episode, they launched a <a href="https://keepingupwithsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p>



<p>The podcast has an obvious play on the fact that they both appeared on <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em>.</p>



<p>Caitlyn spent decades married to Kris Jenner. Lamar Odom had a considerably shorter marriage to Khloe Kardashian.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Sports influencer Zach Hirsch will be their cohost. But he is definitely slipping people&#8217;s minds as folks react to the two reality TV personalities teaming up like this.</p>



<p>Per the site, the podcast threatens to &#8220;deliver a fresh, unflinching looks at what it takes to be the best.&#8221; Okay?</p>



<p>“Each episode goes beyond the headlines, providing listeners with an entertaining perspective on the personal stories behind the champions,&#8221; the site lists. &#8220;Delving into the highs and lows of being in the spotlight, recounting early struggles on the path to success, and exploring how today’s athletes navigate difficulties along their journeys.”</p>

<p>From 2009 until 2013, Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian remained married. The two had wed after only one month of dating.</p>



<p>They even had a spinoff, Khloe and Lamar. However, like so many of Khloe&#8217;s side projects, it was short-lived.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Khloe and Lamar ended up divorcing. Lamar&#8217;s substance abuse struggles and rampant cheating were the primary culprits. Khloe filed in 2013 but only finalized the divorce in 2015.</p>

<p>In 1991, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/kris-jenner-cheating-on-robert-was-my-lifes-biggest-regret/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner</a> married. Their marriage lasted nearly a quarter of a century, ending in 2015.</p>



<p>Famously, they share two daughters &#8212; you may have heard of them: Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.</p>



<p>These days, the two women are no longer on speaking terms. Caitlyn remains close to Kendall and Kylie &#8230; but her bond with many members of the Kardashian family remains strained, or in some cases, nonexistent. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caitlyn-and-lamar-s-podcast-is-already-the-subject-of-jokes">Caitlyn and Lamar&#8217;s podcast is already the subject of jokes</h2>



<p>Even before the episode premiered, people on social media were poking fun at the idea. Some openly asked if the news, which came in mid-March, might be a premature April Fools&#8217; Day prank.</p>



<p>It may be because Caitlyn has used her platform to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/caitlyn-jenner-hurls-anti-trans-stigma-at-tiktok-star-dylan-mulvaney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make the world a worse place</a> for everyone. She is one of the most famous trans women on the planet, but many believe that her pursuit of acceptance from the lowest scum in society is what drives her to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/caitlyn-jenner-pens-weird-op-ed-supporting-segregation-of-transg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocally endorse transphobic rhetoric</a>.</p>



<p>Or &#8230; maybe it&#8217;s because, regardless of how people feel about them, they&#8217;re both has-beens. They have guests lined up, but only time will tell how long this project will last.</p>

<p>We have good news and bad news about Bam Margera&#8217;s downward spiral.</p>



<p>The good news is, after a month in which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/bam-margera-remains-missing-following-assault-on-brother/">Bam assaulted his brother</a>, ran from police, harassed his estranged wife, went missing, and threatened suicide, the former Jackass star has finally checked into rehab.</p>



<p>The bad news is, Bam is <em>still</em> in the habit of harassing his estranged wife, Nikki Boyd.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/bam-margera-wife-files-for-divorce-claims-jackass-star-endangered-5-year-old-son/">Nikki filed for divorce</a> back in February, alleging that Bam&#8217;s substance abuse issues had created an unsafe environment for their five-year-old son.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bam Margera is estranged from his wife and son.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After publicly threatening to overdose on crack, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/bam-margera-placed-on-5150-psychiatric-hold-following-public-breakdown-suicide-threat/">Margera was placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold</a> earlier this week.</p>



<p>He was briefly hospitalized, but staff had no choice but to let him go once he no longer presented an obvious threat to himself or anyone else.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, once he regained his freedom, Margera promptly returned to the activity that seems to take up most of his time these days &#8212; harassing the mother of his child.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bam Margera with his estranged wife and son.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Bam has started texting since his release from the 5150 hold, but the content quickly turned abusive, calling Nikki awful names, saying she is the cause of all his problems, even saying she’s a &#8216;gold digger,'&#8221; Nikki&#8217;s attorney, David Glass, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/06/09/bam-margera-angry-text-wife-5150-nikki-rehab-treatment/">told</a> TMZ this week.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, a lawyer for Bam was quick to clap back, accusing Nikki of unlawfully denying Margera the right to visit his son.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bam continues to support her and Phoenix even though she won’t even allow a phone call or FaceTime with Phoenix,&#8221; said attorney Peter Thompson.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bam Margera after surrendering to police following three days on the run. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;He just wants to see his son and continues to come up against a brick wall on that. Contact would go a long way in getting this resolved.&#8221;</p>



<p>So yeah, it sounds like Bam began &#8220;contacting&#8221; (read: harassing) Nikki as soon as his 5150 hold ended, which is obviously a deeply disturbing development.</p>



<p>But for once, we have some good news to report on the Bam front, as well!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bam has checked into a rehab center owned by Lamar Odom!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After learning of Margera&#8217;s troubles, NBA star and former addict Lama Odom offered Bam a free bed in one of the three rehab facilities he owns and operates.</p>



<p>Bam took Lamar up on that offer, and Odom posted the above photo to his Instagram page on Thursday!</p>



<p>Now, Margera has struggled with addiction throughout his adult life, and this is not his first time in rehab.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="789" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-789x1024.jpg" alt="Bam Margera Photo" class="wp-image-287140" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-789x1024.jpg 789w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-231x300.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-768x996.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-1184x1536.jpg 1184w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-1579x2048.jpg 1579w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-735x953.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-258x335.jpg 258w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-268x347.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-401x520.jpg 401w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-493x640.jpg 493w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-592x768.jpg 592w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-740x960.jpg 740w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo-833x1080.jpg 833w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/bam-margera-photo.jpg 1585w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bam Margera attends a film screening in New York City in 2018. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But as recently as last week, it looked as though Margera had given up on the idea of ever getting sober.</p>



<p>So the fact that he has any interest at all in turning things around is wonderful news.</p>



<p>We wish Bam all the best as he embarks on the long, rewarding road to recovery.</p>

<p>The world will learn a great deal in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/lamar-odom-tells-all-in-sex-drugs-and-kardashians-doc-i-loved-crack-more-than-i-loved-khloe/">Lamar Odom&#8217;s documentary</a>, <em>Sex, Drugs, &amp; Kardashians</em>.</p>



<p>We already know that Lamar cheated on Khloe. That is no secret. Really, even during the cheating, it was barely a secret.</p>



<p>But Lamar&#8217;s wild antics did not always make headlines &#8212; no matter how potentially sensational they could have been.</p>



<p>Now he&#8217;s confessing all &#8230; and admitting that he feels embarrassed and ashamed of how he betrayed his ex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom is starring in a new documentary. And Khloe Kardashian probably won&#8217;t like what he has to say. (Photo via YouTube)</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://people.com/tv/lamar-odom-admits-to-laughing-out-of-embarrassment-at-his-crazy-brazen-cheating-on-khloe-kardashian/"><em>People </em>obtained</a> a sneak peek of <em>TMZ Presents: Lamar Odom: Sex, Drugs, &amp; Kardashians</em>.</p>



<p>At 43, Lamar has lived an eventful life &#8212; within his former NBA career but also in his private (and public) life. Obviously.</p>



<p>Lamar was not the last serial cheater to turn Khloe Kardashian&#8217;s world upside down. But people have not forgotten what went on during their relationship and marriage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Khloe and Lamar on their E! network reality show. (Photo via E!)</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, Lamar very publicly admits that there is more to tell about what went down.</p>



<p>There were, after all, four years to that relationship.</p>



<p>As insanely public as the epic highs and lows of Khloe&#8217;s romantic life have been, not everything entered the public sphere. Until now, apparently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behind the scenes, I put her through s&#8211;t,&#8221; Lamar acknowledges in the preview.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like, s&#8211;t that y&#8217;all don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he then clarifies. </p>



<p>Lamar characterizes that &#8220;The s&#8211;t y&#8217;all know, what y&#8217;all think y&#8217;all know, it&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In contrast, Lamar emphasizes that &#8220;But the stories that y&#8217;all don&#8217;t know is, like, really crazy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh? Like what? Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; Lamar goes into a fair amount of detail about his cheating antics.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have these random women coming out,&#8221; Lamar described. &#8220;Some of them all came out at one time.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>There was more to this than simply &#8220;random women&#8221; coming out to party with him.</p>



<p>According to Lamar, while he was traveling with the NBA, he engaged in &#8220;full-blown relationships.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even at the time, he knew: &#8220;Your wife is Khloe Kardashian. You buggin.'&#8221;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Lamar doesn&#8217;t want anyone to think that he finds his hurtful behavior to be funny, however.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m, like, laughing out of embarrassment right now,&#8221; he explains. </p>



<p>He goes on: &#8220;Like, how you thought you was going to get away with that one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Khloe and Lamar dated for only one month before they decided to marry in 2009.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re thinking that barely knowing someone and then marrying them is not a recipe for a long, successful marriage &#8230; you&#8217;re right.</p>



<p>Four years later, Khloe and Lamar separated. However, they did not immediately divorce in 2013.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom sits down to promote his book, Darkness to Light: A memoir</figcaption></figure>



<p>Khloe delayed filing for divorce.</p>



<p>In fact, she also paused the divorce process in 2015 &#8212; for the best of reasons.</p>



<p>Lamar suffered a near-fatal overdose that year. Khloe used her spousal rights as his wife to help with his care and recovery. Only later, in 2016, did they finalize their divorce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As their marriage fell apart, Lamar writes that Kris called him and said that Khloe wanted to speak with him after a SoulCycle class. However, when he approached Khloe outside of the studio, she had no idea what was going on&#8230; and photographers were there filming the whole incident.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lamar has spoken out multiple times &#8212; some statements more tasteful than others &#8212; about his many regrets about what he put Khloe through.</p>



<p>Last year, he spoke about his intention to &#8220;try my damndest&#8221; to reconnect with his ex-wife.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would probably just want to take her to dinner,&#8221; Lamar expressed. &#8220;It would be a blessing just to be in her presence to just tell her I&#8217;m sorry and what a fool I was.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>This week marks nine years since Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian went their separate ways.</p>



<p>(Yes, Khloe filed for divorce right before Christmas &#8212; but in fairness, Lamar didn&#8217;t leave her with much choice.)</p>



<p>And those years have <em>not</em> been kind to Lamar.</p>



<p>But despite all that Lamar has endured in the time since his marriage and his reality TV career came to an end, it seems  that Khloe is still at the forefront of his mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom is starring in a new documentary. And Khloe Kardashian probably won&#8217;t like what he has to say. (Photo via YouTube)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In a move that&#8217;s unlikely to endear him to his ex, Odom announced this week that he&#8217;ll be the subject of a new TMZ-produced documentary titled <em>Sex, Drugs, and Kardashians</em>.</p>



<p>And it sounds like the title tells you everything you need to know about the subject matter.</p>



<p>“Drugs, that was my girlfriend,” Odom tells host Harvey Levin in a trailer released this week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="TMZ Presents: Lamar Odom: Sex, Drugs &amp; Kardashians | FOX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEXuSMxS6oA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I had a wife … and cocaine,&#8221; Lamar continues.</p>



<p>Odom goes on to reveal that Khloe knew he was using cocaine throughout their marriage.</p>



<p>He then credits her with supporting him throughout the worst years of his addiction.</p>



<p>“I mean, behind the scenes I put her through some s–t,” Odom says, with his head in his hands. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Khloe and Lamar on their E! network reality show. (Photo via E!)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“The things that y’all think y’all know is crazy. But the stories that y’all don’t know is really crazy.”</p>



<p>Lamar&#8217;s doc won&#8217;t premiere until January 3, but if this press release from TMZ is any indication, fans of messy drama and corny basketball puns will have a lot to look forward to:</p>



<p>&#8220;Lamar talks exclusively to TMZ, opening up like never before about his sex addiction and drug use and how it torpedoed his marriage to the love of his life and turned him into a shell of his former self,&#8221; the network writes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="638" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-1024x638.jpg" alt="khlomar" class="wp-image-329481" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-1024x638.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-300x187.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-768x478.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-1536x957.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-2048x1276.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-735x458.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-335x209.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-347x216.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-520x324.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-640x399.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-960x598.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/khlomar-1080x673.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Khloe and Lamar in happier times. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The good news…true to form Lamar has rebounded in a spectacular way,&#8221; the network writes.</p>



<p>Lamar has frequently discussed his desire to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/lamar-odom-throws-tantrum-over-khloe-kardashian-yeah-i-still-miss-her-so-what/">get back to together with Khloe</a>, most recently addressing the subject earlier this year during his time on<em> Celebrity Big Brother</em>.</p>



<p>“I would just probably want to take her to dinner. It will be a blessing just to be in her presence. Just to tell her I’m sorry and what a fool I was,&#8221; Odom said at the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lamar Odom has been through a lot! (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“She has the right to never, ever want to see me again for the things I put her through, but time moves on and people change,&#8221; Odom said.</p>



<p>Khloe probably wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say she never wants to see Lamar again.</p>



<p>But she probably won&#8217;t be going out to dinner with him anytime soon.</p>



<p></p>

<p>After all,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/khloe-kardashian-thats-it-im-done-having-kids/"> Khloe just welcomed her second child</a>, and she has a lot on her plate these days.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s probably not looking to reintroduce Lamar-caliber chaos into her life!</p>

<p>For the past several weeks, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kanye-west-no-longer-a-billionaire-thanks-to-hateful-tirades/">Kanye West has been spewing hateful nonsense</a> and making the world a worse place by normalizing the most egregious forms of prejudice.</p>



<p>Kanye&#8217;s dangerous rhetoric has led to closeted anti-semites such as Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving and washed-up NFL has-been Cole Beasley outing themselves as bigots.</p>



<p>Fortunately, not every professional athlete is willing to follow Kanye into Crazytown.</p>



<p>The paparazzi caught up with Lamar Odom this week while he was walking around LA (dressed in a Yeezy jacket, no less), and naturally, they asked the former Laker for his thoughts on Kanye&#8217;s meltdown.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>t</p>



<p>L</p>



<p>L</p>



<p>“Yes, I’ve heard he upset some people with some things he might have said,&#8221; Odom said in what might be the understatement of the century.</p>



<p>“He’s always going to be dear to me. Because he played music for me when I was waking up from the coma.”</p>



<p>Yes, it seems that when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/05/khloe-kardashian-on-lamar-odoms-shocking-tell-all-book-i-am-disg/">Lamar was comatose</a>, Kanye came to the hospital and played him some tracks from his new album.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Lamar Odom speaks about his time with Khloe Kardashian on Celebrity Big Brother Season 3 in 2022 on CBS. (Photo via CBS)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thinking that you can bring someone out of a coma by playing your music for them is the sort of wildly narcissistic move that we&#8217;ve come to expect from Kanye, but according to Lamar, the trick worked.</p>



<p>Odom says that West’s music, “woke my soul up&#8221; while he was unconscious following his near-fatal overdose.</p>



<p>But these days, Lamar is wide awake, and and like every thinking human being, he recognizes that Kanye has completely gone off the rails.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="890" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1024x890.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461559" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1024x890.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-300x261.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-768x668.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1536x1336.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-2048x1781.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-735x639.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-335x291.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-347x302.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-520x452.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-640x556.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-960x835.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1080x939.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Kanye West attends the Balenciaga Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on October 2, 2022 in Villepinte, France.

<p></p>



<p>Odom has a theory as to the source of Kanye&#8217;s craziness, speculating that the rapper permanently broke down when he lost his mother, Donda West, passed away in 2007.</p>



<p><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/lamar-odom-speaks-out-kanye-west-wishes-his-mom-donda-was-around-khloe/">According to </a>Radar Online, Lamar says he wishes West’s mother Donda was around “to help him articulate his words the right way.”</p>



<p>Obviously, an inability to express himself is not Kanye&#8217;s problem, but it seems that Lamar was doing his damnedest to avoid directly criticizing his former friend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Kanye West has given a lot of bizarre interviews in recent weeks. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Odom admitted that he hasn&#8217;t spoken to West in years, but added, “He’s my brother forever.”</p>



<p>So yeah, Lamar is still defending Kanye, because too often, celebs are afraid to speak out against those who are more famous than themselves.</p>



<p>But at least he&#8217;s not co-signing any the horrific things that West has said in the past few weeks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-1024x768.jpg" alt="Lamar Odom DWTS Photo" class="wp-image-335121" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-1536x1151.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-720x540.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-480x360.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-735x551.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-335x251.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-347x260.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-520x390.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-960x720.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/lamar-odom-dwts-photo-1080x810.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Lamar during his time on Dancing with the Stars?

<p></p>



<p>And hey, we can all take solace in the fact that Lamar is biggest victim of Lamar&#8217;s spinelessness.</p>



<p>Odom has been begging Khloe to take him back for years, and here, he has this golden opportunity to roast the guy who&#8217;s been bullying her family &#8212; and he blows it.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Khloe will remind him of this moment the next time he texts her late at night.</p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian probably isn&#8217;t looking to re-enter the dating pool anytime soon.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/khloe-kardashian-and-tristan-thompson-welcome-baby-2/">Khloe just welcomed her second child</a> back in August, and she&#8217;s a single mom yet again following the latest Tristan Thompson cheating scandal.</p>



<p>But it seems that Khloe&#8217;s ex-husband, Lamar Odom, has remained firm in his hope that when Khloe is ready to resume her search for Mr. Right, she&#8217;ll decide to give him a second chance.</p>



<p>Lamar has never been shy about the fact that he still has feelings for Khloe, but in recent weeks, he&#8217;s been wearing his heart on his sleeve like never before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Khloe and Lamar once had their own Keeping Up With the Kardashians spinoff! It was a different time. (Photo via E!)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Earlier this week, Lamar posted a throwback photo from the brief period when he and Khloe were married.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a little weird on its own, but it was Lamar&#8217;s caption that really raised eyebrows.</p>



<p>“Missing my best friend. #memories for life,&#8221; Odom wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Lamar is a popular presence on Facebook, so most of the comments he received were supportive.</p>



<p>But some followers called Odom out for his allegedly &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; statement.</p>



<p>Just because Khloe is single, they argued, does not mean that Lamar should feel free to publicly mess with her feelings, especially given how much grief her put her through during their relationship.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Lamar Odom speaks about his time with Khloe Kardashian on Celebrity Big Brother Season 3 in 2022 on CBS. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Lamar was quick to clap back against these criticisms, pointing out that he has the right to express his feelings about his ex.</p>



<p>“I’m human just like everyone else,&#8221; Odom wrote.</p>



<p>“Didn’t know we not allowed to miss someone regardless if mistakes were made,” the former NBA star continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“But I get it I let people down and I will pay for it forever and that’s ok too. Goodnight Facebook Family.”</p>



<p>We get Lamar&#8217;s point, but at the same time, the man really put Khloe through hell, and it might be best for everyone if he just gives her some space.</p>



<p>Yes, folks, Tristan wasn&#8217;t the first NBA star to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/khloe-kardashian-my-next-boyfriend-wont-be-a-cheater/">cheat on Khloe</a>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Lamar was also unfaithful, but despite his infidelity, Khloe was the first one to rush to his side after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/12/khloe-kardashian-lamar-odoms-overdose-gave-me-strength/">Odom suffered a near-fatal overdose</a> while they were in the process of ending their marriage.</p>



<p>“He OD’d during the divorce and I was his next of kin, even though it was still, the divorce was still – it was on the judge’s desk,” Kardashian during an episode of the “Divorce Sucks With Laura Wasser” podcast.</p>



<p>“It was like two years, or like a year or two of us trying to get the divorce going and then this happened,&#8221; Khloe continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“And then we paused the divorce, not for any romantic reasons but I wanted to be able to help take care of him and make sure that he would be OK again.”</p>



<p>Perhaps it was during this time that Lamar realized what a huge mistake he&#8217;d made by taking Khloe for granted during their marriage.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s probably too late to win her back now &#8212; but that won&#8217;t stop Lamar from trying!</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/lamar-odom-trashes-khloe-kardashian-for-some-reason-says-ex-has-no-talent/">Lamar Odom took a swipe at Khloe Kardashian</a> for reasons known only to him.</p>



<p>This summer, the world learned that Khloe is expecting her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/khloe-kardashian-expecting-baby-2-with-tristan-thompson/">second child with Tristan Thompson</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a humiliating situation for Khloe. She did not know about Tristan&#8217;s latest lovechild when this one was conceived.</p>



<p>Now, Lamar is weighing in, and suggesting that he could have &#8220;helped.&#8221;</p>

Will that change on Dancing with the Stars? Don&#8217;t bet on it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This week, the world heard Lamar Odom&#8217;s take on his ex-wife&#8217;s very complicated life.</p>



<p>Khloe and Tristan conceived via surrogate, likely in November. Weeks later, Maralee Nichols gave birth to Tristan&#8217;s third kid.</p>



<p>“She could have hollered at me for that,” Lamar quipped at La Belle Vie Med Spa in Woodland Hills, California.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Lamar Odom took to social media in late 2020 to ask for help from his fans in getting his passwords and more back from his ex.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/07/27/lamar-odom-wouldve-offered-to-give-ex-khloe-another-baby/"><em>Page Six</em> reports</a> that Lamar&#8217;s line about offering to conceive a baby with Khloe was a joke &#8230; probably.</p>



<p>The meaning is that Tristan Thompson is a cheater and now Khloe is having <em>two </em>kids of his, not just one.</p>



<p>While that is certainly true &#8230; is Lamar really the best person to speak on that topic?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="950" height="831" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e.png" alt="Tristan and Khloe on E!" class="wp-image-412433" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e.png 950w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-300x262.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-768x672.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-735x643.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-335x293.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-347x304.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-520x455.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/tristan-and-khloe-on-e-640x560.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Tristan Thompson looks absolutely miserable sitting alongside Khloe Kardashian in this photo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lamar and Khloe weren&#8217;t just together &#8212; they were husband and wife.</p>



<p>The two also delved into the idea of having children together, but did not.</p>



<p>Lamar struggled with both substance abuse and with infidelity during their erstwhile marriage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Lamar Odom sits down to promote his book, Darkness to Light: A memoir</figcaption></figure>



<p>Why exactly does one cheater feel entitled to call out another?</p>



<p>On the one hand, it makes Lamar seem like he does not fully appreciate the effects of his own actions.</p>



<p>At the same time, you <em>know </em>that someone&#8217;s cheating is bad if Lamar Odom is calling him out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Tristan cheated on Khloe extensively. Not every incident fueled a massive scandal, but there were several.</p>



<p>Amazingly, she continued to take him back, again and again, sometimes directing her rage at other women.</p>



<p>Khloe felt fixated on the idea of giving True a &#8220;picture perfect&#8221; childhood. In her mind, that meant keeping Tristan around.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>What set Tristan&#8217;s affair with Maralee Nichols apart was simply that she had a child. Well, that was part of it.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know if she was the first woman whom he impregnated while he was with Khloe. But she was apparently the first to give birth.</p>



<p>The timing of it all, just weeks after Khloe and Tristan conceived via surrogate, was what made a difference.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Tristan went through that whole process with Khloe knowing that Maralee would be giving birth.</p>



<p>He kept it a secret from Khloe, apparently for as long as he could, and even pointlessly denied paternity before admitting the truth.</p>



<p>That betrayal &#8212; of Khloe, of True, of Baby #2 was the last straw. Well, we <em>hope </em>that it was, anyway.</p>

<p>Lamar Odom has apparently changed his romantic tune.</p>



<p>For many years, long after his divorce from Khloe Kardashian, the former NBA star had openly pined after his ex-wife.</p>



<p>As recently as this past February, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/lamar-odom-to-khloe-kardashian-the-people-want-us-back-together/">Odom remarked on how</a> &#8220;refreshing&#8221; it has been to hear support from social media users who want to see him and Khloe reconcile.</p>



<p>&#8220;She’ll always have a place in my heart,&#8221; Odom said of his famous ex-spouse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"></figure>



<p>This may still be the case.</p>



<p>But Lamar has a funny way of expressing his feeling if so&#8230; considering he was asked by Page Six this week whether he&#8217;d prefer to get back together with Kardashian or Taraji P. Henson.</p>



<p>Odom has previously been involved with both of these lovely women.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think the difference between Taraji and Khloé is how they [were] brought up,&#8221; Odom replied. &#8220;Their upbringing, which makes people different and [affects] the way they think.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Okay, fine. Fair enough.</p>



<p>But then Lamar went on to elaborate on his point, basically saying that not only is Henson <em>different</em> from Khloe; she&#8217;s more <em>talented</em>, too.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Taraji is more skillful in what she does as an actress compared to what Khloe does,&#8221; <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/06/28/lamar-odom-reveals-which-famous-ex-he-would-like-to-date-again/">he told the outlet</a>. </p>



<p>Despite the apparently shade, Odom did refer to Kardashian in this same interview as a &#8220;great wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odom and Henson dated throughout 2009. </p>



<p>Lamar then split from the actress and married Kardashian after a mere month of courtship; the two separated in 2016.</p>



<p>Ever since, however, Odom and Kardashian have only said nice things about each other in public.</p>



<p>Khloe also rushed to be by Lamar&#8217;s side after his near-fatal drug overdose in the fall of 2016.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;When I came out of the coma, she took care of me. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m talking about a woman that wiped my backside when I couldn’t do it myself,” Odom told Us Weekly in February about Kardashian’s care for him in the hospital back then.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, I’m fond of her for that. </p>



<p>&#8220;She had a lot of dignity and pride as well as I did.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Khloe, of course, most recently dated Tristan Thompson&#8230; on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>She gave birth to his daughter three years ago, too, although the relationship fell apart after Thompson cheated on her&#8230; on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>At times throughout this challenging romance, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/lamar-odom-to-khloe-kardashian-sorry-tristan-cheated-again-wanna/">Odom has hinted that he&#8217;d be interested</a> in rekindling things with Kardashian.</p>



<p>She never reciprocated this interest, though.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why Lamar has decided to turn his attention back to Henson, not that they have any chance of making out again, either.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love Taraji. It’s a love thing. It’s about who you love,” Odom explained to Page Six his hypothetical decision. </p>



<p>&#8220;Taraji is a cool girl. Matter fact she’s here [in L.A.]. </p>



<p>&#8220;I got to see her at the BET Awards in June. So maybe I’ll get to shoot my shot at her again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Good luck with that, dude. We&#8217;re guessing you&#8217;re gonna need it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>For her part, meanwhile?</p>



<p>We doubt Khloe cares much about Odom has to say these days.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s moved on, according to various reports, and is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/khloe-kardashian-dating-some-rich-rando-finally-done-with-tristan/">now dating some unnamed businessman</a>.</p>
