<p>It sounds like MTV has fired Ashley Jones.</p>



<p><em>Ghosted </em>her, even, leaving her to find out that she&#8217;s not returning to <em>Teen Mom</em> the same way that the rest of us did.</p>



<p>Last year, we reported that a certain and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/mackenzie-mckee-returns-to-teen-mom-immediately-clashing-with-costars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous <em>Teen Mom</em> alum was making a comeback</a>.</p>



<p>Apparently, MTV is swapping her in for Ashley. And fans are fuming.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-1024x576.png" alt="Ashley Jones gestures while speaking calmly yet firmly." class="wp-image-492224" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the Teen Mom 2 Reunion, Ashley Jones made her feelings clear.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-mtv-fired-ashley-jones-from-teen-mom">Has MTV fired Ashley Jones from &#8216;Teen Mom&#8217;?</h2>



<p>According to a report from blogger @teenmomfanz on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C274paxPX6f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, Ashley Jones will not be returning to <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>.</p>



<p>The report notes that producers did not contact Ashley to inform her that she would not be returning.</p>



<p>Instead, they simply began filming without her. This is not the first time that we have heard of this happening to reality TV cast members &#8212; or, specifically, to<em> Teen Mom</em> stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t even tell Ashley. This isn&#8217;t the last of her, though,&#8221; the Instagram blogger reported hearing from a production source.</p>



<p>Officially, Ashley did not immediately respond to the news &#8212; neither to confirm nor deny.</p>



<p>However, her husband, Bar Smith, replied <em>directly </em>to the report. And he&#8217;s not exactly disputing it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="666" height="257" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar.png" alt="A dark mode Instagram screenshot of Bar, Ashley Jones' husband, responding to the news that MTV has ghosted the couple." class="wp-image-492228" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar.png 666w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar-300x116.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar-335x129.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar-347x134.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar-520x201.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0205_ashleyjones_ig_bar-640x247.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley Jones&#8217; husband, Bar, commented in early February to indicate his astonishment that he and his wife would not be returning to Teen Mom.

<p>&#8220;Crazy way to find out you was fired,&#8221; Bar commented.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welp, it was a good run with you all,&#8221; he added graciously. &#8220;Thanks for supporting us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the report sowed further outrage when it revealed who is reportedly replacing Ashley on the franchise.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="602" height="627" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/mackenzie-mc-kee.png" alt="Mackenzie Mckee with blonde hair." class="wp-image-404503" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/mackenzie-mc-kee.png 602w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/mackenzie-mc-kee-288x300.png 288w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/mackenzie-mc-kee-322x335.png 322w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/mackenzie-mc-kee-333x347.png 333w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/mackenzie-mc-kee-499x520.png 499w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie McKee on Teen Mom OG. Some people court controversy. Others blunder into it regularly.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mtv-would-rather-have-mackenzie-mckee">MTV would rather have Mackenzie McKee??</h2>



<p>The report announced that Mackenzie McKee, who underwent a similar <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/mackenzie-mckee-i-dont-understand-why-no-one-wants-me-on-teen-mom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ghosting-style firing by MTV</a> a couple of years ago, will be her replacement.</p>



<p>Of course, Mackenzie&#8217;s then-recent racism scandal was fresh in the minds of many viewers. Her firing did not elicit a lot of tears.</p>



<p>In contrast, fans of the franchise are not responding positively to the news of this <em>switcheroo</em>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="626" height="545" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/mackenzie-mckee-as-a-teen-mom.png" alt="Mackenzie McKee as a Teen Mom" class="wp-image-413786" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/mackenzie-mckee-as-a-teen-mom.png 626w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/mackenzie-mckee-as-a-teen-mom-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/mackenzie-mckee-as-a-teen-mom-335x292.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/mackenzie-mckee-as-a-teen-mom-347x302.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/mackenzie-mckee-as-a-teen-mom-520x453.png 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie McKee looks on in slight annoyance and/or confusion in this screenshot from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Commenters across social media are noting how this is not exactly exciting news.</p>



<p>Some will miss Ashley. Even more will miss Holly, Ashley&#8217;s 5-year-old.</p>



<p>And many more are expressing everything from annoyance to disgust over Mackenzie&#8217;s return. She has, many fans feel, screwed up too many times to deserve another chance &#8212; or to be a welcome sight on their screens.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="938" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-1024x938.jpg" alt="Mackenzie McKee Looks Sad" class="wp-image-334582" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-1024x938.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-300x275.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-768x704.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-735x674.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-335x307.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-347x318.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-520x477.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-640x587.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-960x880.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad-1080x990.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/mackenzie-mckee-looks-sad.jpg 1448w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Poor Mackenzie McKee, right? She looks rather upset in this screenshot from Teen Mom OG.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-somehow-mackenzie-is-returning">Somehow, Mackenzie is returning</h2>



<p>Back in January, Mackenzie and her boyfriend, Khesanio Hall, soft-launched the fact that she was filming.</p>



<p>While recording a TikTok video, they showcased someone who was clearly part of the production or camera crew in the background.</p>



<p>This person only appeared for a moment &#8212; but it was enough for her followers to conclude that Mackenzie is back on TV.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="544" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/mackenzie-mckee-as-an-og.png" alt="Mackenzie McKee as an OG" class="wp-image-405886" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/mackenzie-mckee-as-an-og.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/mackenzie-mckee-as-an-og-300x255.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/mackenzie-mckee-as-an-og-335x285.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/mackenzie-mckee-as-an-og-347x295.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/mackenzie-mckee-as-an-og-520x442.png 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie McKee appears in this scene from an episode of the MTV series, Teen Mom OG.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Obviously, Mackenzie couldn&#8217;t confirm that she was filming again.</p>



<p>But between reports that she was filming late last year and then this &#8220;slip&#8221; a few weeks ago, the signs are all there.</p>



<p>And that was before the report that she&#8217;s replacing Ashley. It&#8217;s not great news! But, as the report claims, Ashley could certainly return one day.</p>

<p>The <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise has brought us many memorable feuds over the years.</p>



<p>And on more than one occasion, co-stars have come to blows during various reunion events.</p>



<p>Heated arguments are good for ratings, of course, but actual violence always carries with it the threat of costly legal action.</p>



<p>Which is why producers are very concerned about the recent exchange of threats between <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> co-stars Jade Cline and Ashley Jones.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="349" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley.webp" alt="Jade, Ashley" class="wp-image-412982" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley.webp 620w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley-480x270.webp 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley-320x180.webp 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley-335x189.webp 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley-347x195.webp 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jade-ashley-520x293.webp 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jade and Ashley have been feuding for years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It started as an amusing war of words </p>



<p>Jade alleged that Ashley’s husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/bar-smith-ashley-jones-husband-locked-up-on-100000-bail-for-dui-weapons-charges/">Bar Smith had not completed a rehabilitation program</a> that MTV had sent him to.</p>



<p>Hilariously, she also roasted Bar for having “two sets of eyebrows.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jade Cline lashed out against her MTV bosses in a recent tweet. The Teen Mom 2 star says the show is edited in such a way as to make her look like a bad mom.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ashley shot back that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/03/jade-cline-gets-back-together-with-sean-austin-celebrates-with-l/">Jade’s fiancé Sean Austin</a> had “meth head on skid row” teeth before getting sober.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, the situation soon escalated beyond insults, with Ashley issuing a veiled threat about the upcoming reunion show taping.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will literally be seeing you in 16 days, don&#8217;t get no panic attack,&#8221; Jones tweeted.</p>



<p>“Girl pleaseee. You talk s&#8211;t online then stay distant in person,&#8221; Cline replied.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley and Bar have become fan favorites on MTV. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;You had MTV last year doing your whole segment alone. You been trying to be a mean girl since [<em>Teen Mom Young &amp; Pregnant</em>]. It’s old. Run up or shut up in LA.”</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, producers weren&#8217;t thrilled to see threats flying back and forth.</p>



<p>“Online fighting like this is a nightmare for the producers,” <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/08/02/exclusive-teen-mom-producers-freaking-out-over-online-spats-between-jade-cline-ashley-jones-this-is-a-nightmare-for-the-producers/">one production source</a> told The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="857" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-1024x857.png" alt="" class="wp-image-352215" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-1024x857.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-300x251.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-768x643.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-735x615.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-335x280.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-347x290.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-520x435.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-640x536.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant-960x804.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/jade-on-young-and-pregnant.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jade originally appeared on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant, but then MTV pulled her to replace Jenelle after she got fired.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p> “Even if there is a threat of physical violence [the producers] have to take action. Even if the girls claim they aren’t planning on doing anything.”</p>



<p>A different source compared the situation to the fight between Kayla Sessler and Dez Rodriguez, which was featured on <em>Next Chapter</em>.</p>



<p>“When punches are thrown— and they connect before security stops them— it is a huge legal issue,&#8221; said the insider.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kayla Sessler has launched several feuds during her time in the spotlight.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The footage captured [of Kayla and Dez’s fight] may not even be aired because of the legal issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Make no mistake: the fighting is always good for ratings,&#8221; a different source told The Ashley.</p>



<p>&#8220;But stuff like this– stuff that can be taken as threats of physical violence— gets everyone at the network freaking out because they will be liable if something major happens,” a second source said.</p>



<p>Jade has now removed her tweet that told Ashley to “run up or shut up,&#8221; possibly at the behest of producers.</p>



<p>“I stay distant cause y’all cry. Kinda like how you tweeting now but production is calling me telling me that you are feeling ‘threatened,&#8217;” Ashley wrote in reply.</p>

And the feeling is mutual! <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I won’t be running up, I’ll be calling the police you thug.”</p>



<p>The latest dust-up between Jade and Ashley began earlier this week when Jones tweeted an allegation that producers had cut important content from her storyline that would have made her actions in the latest episode more understandable.</p>



<p>&#8220;This storyline with Cheyenne was non-existent until she decided to call Bar with Zach and talk a bunch of s&#8211;t while they were down in Florida in front of all the other girls,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;This upset me because if Zach had an issue he should have called in the privacy of his home, not for an audience in Florida … this is my reason for being so upset in tonight’s episode,&#8221; Jones continued.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant star Ashley Jones is popular on Instagram. The girl enjoys a good selfie.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“So when you see tonight’s episode and think damn Ashley’s energy is off, it’s because that first phone call didn’t make it into the cut and that first phone call was what pissed me off.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear at this time what sort of actions MTV will take to minimize the risk of violence at the reunion.</p>



<p>In the past, Ashley has been separated from the rest of the cast to ensure that there would be no fighting, and it seems likely that producers will take that route again.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Bar Smith and Ashley Jones have experienced plenty of ups and downs over the course of their relationship.</p>



<p>Just last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/bar-smith-ashley-jones-husband-arrested-held-without-bail-after-running-from-police/">Bar was arrested</a> and locked up on DUI and weapons charges.</p>



<p>But while their lives have been volatile at times, Bar and Ashley&#8217;s love for one another always seemed to remain consistent.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why fans were so surprised this week when Smith and Jones deleted all of their photos of one another on Instagram.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley Jones and Bar Smith recently hinted that they had broken up.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Bar and Ashley also unfollowed one another on the site, leading fans to conclude that they had separated.</p>



<p>At first, both parties declined to comment on the situation, which only added to the perception that these two had called it quits.</p>



<p>But now, Bar has broken his silence with a series of cryptic comments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley and Bar have become fan favorites on MTV. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Some Men don&#8217;t grow up so their women outgrow them,&#8221; Smith wrote on his Instagram Story, alongside a photo of Ashley and her mother on stage at a Teen Mom reunion taping.</p>



<p>&#8220;No productive person wants to be in a relationship with no communication, no compassion, no romance, no affection, no common goals towards life or drive to get there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, Bar kept things vague, but many have interpreted the comments as his way of hinting that he and Ashley are still together.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bar Smith has traded in his stylish gear for a county orange jumpsuit. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting, however, that he won&#8217;t come right out and say that.</p>



<p>Whatever is going on with them now, it seems that Bar and Ashley <em>did</em> hit a rough patch recently.</p>



<p>But Bar has gone on the attack against the people who claimed that the couple went so far as to break up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm crazy how this ain’t what is going on but y’all just went in on me in the comments,&#8221; he wrote in response to a fan&#8217;s question about the split.</p>



<p>&#8220;Safe to know that y’all actually don’t f&#8211;k with me, and couldn’t wait for the opportunity, and for that f&#8211;k all of y’all now.&#8221;</p>



<p>As further confirmation that there was some sort of trouble in paradise, Ashley&#8217;s mom replied to Bar and basically asked him to leave her out of it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley Jones got famous on 16 and Pregnant. She&#8217;s now a cast member on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Uhmmmm take me out of this. My subliminals are to my own husband,&#8221; she wrote, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/7693492/teen-mom-bar-smith-rumors-ashley-jones-split/">according to</a> UK tabloid The Sun.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got my own problems this morning fr fr. I ain’t in they s&#8211;t. But you can tell my husband I’m pissed with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bar and Ashley got married in 2022, and they were reportedly planning a second wedding for later this year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bar has broken his silence with some strange commentary about his marriage. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We guess if the nuptials get called off, then we&#8217;ll know that they&#8217;re officially dunz-o.</p>



<p>On the bright side, if these two <em>did</em> break up, we guess they can be grateful that the split happened <em>before</em> the ceremony instead of right after!</p>



<p>At least they&#8217;d save some money that way!</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t supposed to be this way.</p>



<p><em>Teen Mom: Family Reunion </em>was supposed to be a fun, frivolous break from the usual drama that defines MTV&#8217;s longest-running franchise.</p>



<p>But the past two episodes have featured some of the messiest behavior in <em>Teen Mom</em> history.</p>



<p>It all started, of course, with a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/teen-mom-family-reunion-trailer-released-we-finally-get-to-see-ashley-jones-briana-dejesus-knock-each-other-out/">brawl between Briana DeJesus and Ashley Jones</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Adding to the insanity of the situation was the fact that both women&#8217;s mothers were present for the fight.</p>



<p>Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/catelynn-lowell-i-had-to-tell-everyone-about-ashley-jones-pregnancy-so-that-briana-dejesus-wouldnt-beat-her-up/">Ashley was pregnant</a> at the time of the altercation.</p>



<p>The fight began when the cast was seated around a picnic table, and it escalated to the point the Ashley spit on Bri, which prompted DeJesus to hurl a water bottle at Jones.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Must-See Moments: Family Reunion Season 2 (So Far!) | Teen Mom Family Reunion" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unwGkwYzL9s?start=359&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>You can watch the scene in the video above, starting about the six-minute mark.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually upset I wasn&#8217;t able to touch her because she spit on me,&#8221; DeJesus remarked when recalling the fight in last night&#8217;s episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ashley and her mother continued to talk crap and I guess things got heated at the dinner table and I got some spit on me,&#8221; Bri continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>From there, Bri attempted to defend her actions, but it was too little, too late.</p>



<p>&#8220;I threw one of the canteens, but that&#8217;s besides the point,&#8221; DeJesus explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for her, I don&#8217;t want to work it out with her. I know the type of person that she is. She will never change. I don&#8217;t need her in my life,&#8221; she added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Briana DeJesus smiles big in an episode of Teen Mom 2. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;We all sign a piece of paper that we&#8217;re not allowed to touch each other, not allowed to exchange bodily fluids with each other, we&#8217;re not allowed to do any of things things. You already crossed that line.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Moving forward, I can&#8217;t be in the same vicinity as Ashley or even her mother. F&#8212; them,&#8221; Briana added in a confessional. </p>



<p>&#8220;I want to move forward and continue working on things with my mother and making stronger friendships.&#8221;</p>

(Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ashley was less optimistic, saying bluntly, &#8220;None of this seems worth it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to be fake and smile with people I don&#8217;t want to f&#8212;ing be around. It was nice to see those girls that I do enjoy seeing occasionally.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ashley gave the impression that she and Tea left of their own accord, but later scenes proved that that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In the next scene, producers visited Bri and Roxanne and explained that the throwing of the water bottle constituted &#8220;a significant breach of contract&#8221; and both mother and daughter would &#8220;have to go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Bri explained that she acted in self-defense, one producer shot back, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter first or not. It&#8217;s going to apply to all of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s kind of bulls&#8212; though, I felt threatened,&#8221; she added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Briana DeJesus looks bummed about something. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re dealing with a demonic presence like them, it&#8217;s kind of difficult to be the bigger person. With people like that, you can&#8217;t be the bigger person,&#8221; Roxanne chimed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all going home. You&#8217;re not being singled out,&#8221; the producer explained, thus clarifying that Ashley and Tea were also being removed from the premises.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t the aggressor. I wasn&#8217;t here to cause problems. I was literally trying to defend myself,&#8221; Briana said in a confessional.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p> &#8220;I still don&#8217;t understand why I have to go and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair. But it is what it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite rumors to the contrary, there&#8217;s no reason to believe that either Bri or Ashley has been fired from the franchise entirely.</p>



<p>Both will almost certainly be back for the next season of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> &#8212; but you can bet that they&#8217;re both on thin ice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>A new season of <em>Teen Mom Family Reunion </em>is upon us, and with it come the usual complaints of franchise overkill.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, of course, as <em>16 and Pregnant</em> launched way back in 2009, and at this point, it&#8217;s launched more spinoffs than <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>



<p>Viewers complain that the show is not as dramatic as it used to be and that they can&#8217;t relate to the problems of a bunch of rich reality stars.</p>



<p>But nothing breathes new life into a long-running series quite like a savage brawl &#8212; especially when one of the combatants is pregnant!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, Tuesday&#8217;s episode of Family Reunion featured a knock-down-drag-out <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/teen-mom-family-reunion-trailer-released-we-finally-get-to-see-ashley-jones-briana-dejesus-knock-each-other-out/">fight between longtime rivals Briana DeJesus and Ashley Jones</a>.</p>



<p>The scene got so nasty that even the ladies&#8217; moms got involved.</p>



<p>To her credit, Briana didn&#8217;t know that Ashley was pregnant at the time of the altercation.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Catelynn Lowell <em>did</em> have that information, but she was at a safe distance at the time of the fight.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Looking great, Catelynn! Tyler shared this lovely photo of his wife on Instagram in late 2021. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>While sitting outside waiting for the melee to end, Cate told some of her co-stars about Ashley&#8217;s pregnancy.</p>



<p>Now, she&#8217;s being roasted on Reddit for violating her friend&#8217;s privacy.</p>



<p>To be fair, Cate found herself in a pretty tricky situation, and now she&#8217;s defending her actions with a very lengthy Twitter tirade.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“At the time of this whole altercation between Ashley &amp; Briana, there were only 2 of us girls who knew Ashley was pregnant,&#8221; Lowell wrote.</p>



<p><br>&#8220;I was outside when the actual physical part of the fight happened but I told Ashley (after all the yelling incident at dinner) that she doesn’t need this stress, drama, etc. because it’s not good for her &amp; the baby!” Cate continued.</p>



<p>“It was AFTER I knew about the physical attacks &amp; risks, that I decided to let Jade know about Ashley being pregnant so that way everyone would at least know! Because I wasn’t sure what was going to happen!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="938" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-1024x938.png" alt="Catelynn Lowell on Finale" class="wp-image-404699" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-1024x938.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-300x275.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-768x704.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-735x673.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-335x307.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-347x318.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-520x476.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-640x586.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale-960x879.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/catelynn-lowell-on-finale.png 1073w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Catelynn Lowell is seen here on the final episode of Teen Mom OG in the year 2021. She looks good. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Catelynn went on to acknowledge that she may not have made the right call, but she noted that it was a snap decision made with friend&#8217;s best interests at heart.</p>



<p>“Was it right of me to tell Jade about Ashley being pregnant? No! … But honestly, I never thought Ashley would ever get physical &amp; take that kind of risk with someone knowing she’s pregnant!” she noted.</p>



<p>“If I were ever trying to fight some girl, I’d want to know if she’s pregnant or not! Or if I had a friend I knew who was hiding a pregnancy &amp; she didn’t have control of her emotions &amp; was about to get into a physical altercation with someone, you best believe I’d be running up there screaming at everyone involved:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;‘She’s pregnant! Don’t touch her!’ so I could try &amp; lessen the risk of something dangerous happening to her &amp; her baby!”</p>



<p>Cate concluded by noting that she “will ALWAYS put safety over loyalty when it comes to prioritizing what’s more important and I won’t ever be sorry for it!”</p>



<p>Catelynn might be guilty of failing to keep her friend&#8217;s secret, but it seems that her heart was genuinely in the right place.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="823" height="463" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing.png" alt="" class="wp-image-455395" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing.png 823w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Catelynn-Lowell-laughing-640x360.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Catelynn Lowell laughs during an episode of Teen Mom OG.

<p></p>



<p>Hopefully, that&#8217;ll be enough to earn her the forgiveness of <em>Family Reunion </em>viewers.</p>



<p>And hey, if nothing else, at least the show is interesting again!</p>

<p>Well, another season of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> is in the books, and that means it&#8217;s time for a multi-episode reunion special.</p>



<p>In what might be a sign of the franchise&#8217;s declining popularity, this year&#8217;s reunion is only two installments long, despite the fact that the show has a massive cast.</p>



<p>Although to be fair, there was one fewer guest for Dr. Drew to interrogate this time around.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because Briana DeJesus stormed out of the studio just before the cameras started rolling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The reason?</p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-and-ashley-jones-fight-during-teen-mom-taping/">Briana has been feuding with Ashley Jones</a> for quite some time now.</p>



<p>In fact, it seems that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/teen-mom-family-reunion-trailer-released-we-finally-get-to-see-ashley-jones-briana-dejesus-knock-each-other-out/">Briana and Ashley brawled</a> while filming the upcoming season of <em>Teen Mom: Family Reunion</em>.</p>



<p>So it makes sense that Bri wouldn&#8217;t want to share a stage with her least-favorite MTV colleague.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="447" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/briana-on-teen-mom-the-second.jpg" alt="Briana on Teen Mom the Second" class="wp-image-353522" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/briana-on-teen-mom-the-second.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/briana-on-teen-mom-the-second-300x279.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/briana-on-teen-mom-the-second-335x312.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/09/briana-on-teen-mom-the-second-347x323.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is a screen capture of Briana DeJesus from an episode of Teen Mom. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve known about this situation since November, when The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2022/12/21/briana-dejesus-explains-why-she-didnt-want-to-film-teen-mom-the-next-chapter-reunion-with-ashley-jones-i-just-couldnt-do-that-again/">first reported </a>that Briana had stormed off.</p>



<p>But we didn&#8217;t have all of the details until this week, when we finally got to hear the story from Bri&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>“I feel like this setup is not what I want it to be,” DeJesus told producers after they explained that she would be sitting next to Ashley on stage.</p>



<p></p>

<p>“I don’t feel comfortable,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Bri offered further elaboration:</p>



<p>“I had hella anxiety,” she tweeted. </p>

(Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I was also torn between the two-repeating history and going off or setting boundaries and I made the right decision. I didn’t want to be left out again and get sent home.”</p>



<p>Yes, Bri is referring to the infamous 2018 incident, in which she feuded with her then-rival Kailyn Lowry.</p>



<p>(Briana and Kailyn are still not on good terms &#8212; but Kail no longer appears on Teen Mom, so the feud is not a source of professional stress for DeJesus.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Honestly I don’t want to fight with anyone on my cast,” Briana said in a second tweet. “It is extremely exhausting.”</p>



<p>It probably is exhausting &#8212; but it&#8217;s hard to believe that Bri is an innocent victim in all of this.</p>



<p>After all, she&#8217;s now had intense feuds with multiple cast members, and that&#8217;s probably no mere coincidence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Briana DeJesus is bummed about her breakup with Bobby Scott in this pic from the show. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Bri is popular with fans and beloved by her family &#8212; but there&#8217;s no denying that she&#8217;s got a sharp tongue and a short temper.</p>



<p>Still, she did the right thing in this situation by removing herself before things turned violent again.</p>



<p>Hopefully her bosses praised her for sparing the network&#8217;s security team from breaking up another messy fight.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Briana DeJesus looks a little confused here, Wonder why. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But it seems far more likely that they gave her a hard time.</p>



<p>After all, this show&#8217;s viewership has fallen off a cliff, and nothing boosts ratings like a good fight!</p>

<p>A new season of <em>Teen Mom: Family Reunion </em>is almost upon us, which means the ladies will once again be repeating the same stories we&#8217;ve heard a million times, but this time in Lake Tahoe or something.</p>



<p>The first trailer for the new season dropped this week, and already, there have been some surprises.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/leah-messer-quitting-the-teen-mom-franchise-amid-messy-jaylan-mobley-breakup/">Leah Messer will <em>not</em> be joining the cast </a>a fact that has led many to wonder if she has quit the franchise entirely.</p>



<p>(Short answer: Almost certainly not.)</p>

(Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>On top of that, the Moms will be joined by their own moms, which could certainly complicate things.</p>



<p>But just because their maternal role models will be on hand, that doesn&#8217;t mean the ladies will be on their best behavior.</p>



<p>In fact, if the trailer is any indication, the moms are even more out of pocket this year than they have been in seasons past.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Rumors of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-and-ashley-jones-fight-during-teen-mom-taping/">Briana DeJesus-Ashley Jones brawl</a> have been circulating since the summer when the show filmed.</p>



<p>Despite<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-i-did-not-try-to-beat-up-pregnant-ashley-jones/"> Briana&#8217;s insistence that she did not try to beat up a pregnant Jones</a> on set, it seems that some sort of serious altercation went down between these two.</p>



<p>It looks as though the conflict actually started between the castmates&#8217; moms, Roxanne DeJesus &#8212; who is will known to fans &#8212; and Tea Jones &#8212; who is apparently just as much of a crazy person.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tea Jones is the mother of Ashley. And she is angry. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Y’all speak on my daughter, I’m coming for your mother f&#8211;king ass,” Tea said.</p>



<p>At that point Ashley screams, &#8220;F-ck you&#8221; at someone, presumably Briana, and all hell breaks loose.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s always a security team on hand, so we can assume that no one was seriously injured.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="700" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021.jpg" alt="Briana DeJesus in 2021" class="wp-image-416320" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-300x273.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-735x670.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-335x305.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-347x316.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-520x474.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-640x583.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Briana DeJesus looks rather concerned in this photo, doesn&#8217;t she?</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s never a good thing when people resort to physical violence.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re trying to look on the bright side of this situation.</p>



<p>For one thing, the main viewer complaint about Teen Mom in recent seasons has been that the shows are boring, and that certainly won&#8217;t be the case here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A brawl on the set of Teen Mom Family Reunion. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>On top of that, the situation probably made some of the other girls feel less sad about their own dysfunctional family  situations.</p>



<p>“I know I’m not the only one with mommy issues,” Catelynn Lowell quips in the trailer, her remark presumably prompted by the brawl.</p>



<p>Yes, pretty much no one on Teen Mom comes from a healthy family situation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley Jones looks like she doesn&#8217;t mean that smile. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>And perhaps the show will serve as a reminder that all of these ladies have overcome a lot, which will lead to greater empathy from viewers.</p>



<p>But probably not.</p>



<p>Either way, we&#8217;ll get to see a good, old-fashioned reality TV brawl, which is always a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>Teen Mom fans know that drama is just of the fun when it comes to this very special series.</p>



<p>But this latest drama is &#8230; well, it&#8217;s a lot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Settle in, because this could take a while.</p>



<p>OK, so we know that during the taping of Teen Mom Family Reunion, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-and-ashley-jones-fight-during-teen-mom-taping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fight broke out</a> between Briana DeJesus, Ashley Jones, and both of their mothers.</p>



<p>It all started because Briana&#8217;s mom, Roxanne, made a comment one night about how the grandmothers on the show should have each other&#8217;s backs.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Tea, Ashley&#8217;s mom, took that personally, and it turned out that Roxanne was insinuating, at least partially, that she didn&#8217;t appreciate some of the things Tea had posted on social media.</p>



<p>The two ladies started screaming at each other and tried to turn things physical, but security managed to calm things down &#8230; for the moment. </p>



<p>Later that night, all four of them found themselves in the kitchen together, and that&#8217;s when Ashley allegedly spit on Briana.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-i-did-not-try-to-beat-up-pregnant-ashley-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Things did get more violent this time around</a>, but we won&#8217;t know the full extent until the episode airs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We do know that Ashley, Briana, and their mothers were forced to leave the show early, and that the feud continued on social media afterwards.</p>



<p>It was a lot at the time, but last weekend MTV filmed the reunion special for both Family Reunion and The Next Chapter &#8230;</p>



<p>And you won&#8217;t believe what a mess it was.</p>



<p>According to sources who <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2022/10/28/exclusive-walk-offs-angry-twerking-arguments-more-all-the-behind-the-scenes-details-from-last-weekends-teen-mom-reunion-tapings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> with The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, &#8220;tensions were high&#8221; from the beginning because of everything that had happened before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>When it was time to film the segment with the whole cast, “Briana was told that Ashley would be on-stage with her,&#8221; but she was assured that &#8220;that they would seat Ashley far away from Briana.&#8221;</p>



<p>“When Briana saw that Ashley wasn’t actually very far from her on stage, Briana walked off and told [the producers] that she didn’t feel comfortable,&#8221; the source explained.</p>



<p>“The producers tried to get Briana to go back out there with Ashley but she refused and told them she didn’t feel safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was all that happened during the taping of the reunion for The Next Chapter, but something strange happened when they began filming for Family Reunion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“Ashley wasn’t allowed on the set anywhere near any of the other girls for the ‘Family Reunion’ taping,” a source said</p>



<p>.“They said she was banned for ‘legal reasons’ and everyone assumed it’s because [the fight] happened on the ‘Family Reunion’ set. It was just so weird that the day before Ashley was allowed near everyone.” </p>



<p>The Ashley theorized that the shows were produced by different companies there could have been different rules, and that makes sense.</p>



<p>But what happened later, well, that doesn&#8217;t make sense at all.</p>

<p>After the cast finished filming for the day, &#8220;all the girls other than Ashley got into two vans to leave the set.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They passed Ashley on their way out and she realized who was in the vans. That’s when she began doing her signature twerking moves at the second van.&#8221;</p>



<p>Signature twerking moves. You can&#8217;t make this stuff up.</p>



<p>“A lot of the girls found it super-disrespectful and it really angered one girl in particular, someone who had not had any previous disagreements with Ashley and had previously liked her,&#8221; the source continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“That girl confronted Ashley later on the phone and that conversation ended in a huge argument. No one got physical but it probably would have if the conversation had been in-person.&#8221;</p>



<p>That person, shockingly enough, was Amber Portwood.</p>



<p>(JK, it&#8217;s not shocking at all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber got felony charges</a> over Fourth of July fireworks, why wouldn&#8217;t someone twerking make her lose it?)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="461" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction.png" alt="Amber Portwood Reaction" class="wp-image-323865" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction.png 492w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction-300x281.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction-335x314.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction-347x325.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ashley and her husband, Bar, explained later that he was simply filming her twerking for a TikTok, which checks out &#8212; there is a video on her account of her lip syncing and doing a little shimmying in what appears to be the outside of the production studio.</p>



<p>That makes infinitely more sense &#8212; why would she twerk at the Teen Mom cast aggressively? Why would anyone think that&#8217;s what she was doing?</p>



<p>Seriously, just think about it for a minute: you are walking away from your archenemy but before you get out of their line of sight, they start twerking in your direction as a sign of great disrespect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Is that real life, or is that a bunch of people who don&#8217;t like one girl making up reasons to bash her?</p>



<p>Look, Ashley isn&#8217;t perfect, of course, but what kind of world do we live in if we can&#8217;t even twerk for TikTok without it turning into this?</p>



<p>Anyway, about that phone call that Amber made to Ashley &#8230;</p>



<p>Yeah, Ashley shared clips of it on Instagram.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s a little hard to understand what Amber said because she was absolutely just screaming her head off, but she did call Ashley a &#8220;dumb f-cking c-nt.&#8221; </p>



<p>She also told her that she was &#8220;going to be off the motherf-cking show,&#8221; meaning Amber thinks she can get Ashley fired, and of course she told her &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna f-ck your ass up if you ever say anything to my motherf-cking face.&#8221;</p>



<p>In what should become a classic Teen Mom quote, when Ashley told Amber that she was deranged, Amber agreed, saying &#8220;I am deranged, you dumb motherf-cker: clinically deranged.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="670" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1024x670.png" alt="Amber Portwood Bares Her Soul" class="wp-image-415652" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1024x670.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-300x196.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-768x503.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1536x1006.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-735x481.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-335x219.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-347x227.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-520x340.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-640x419.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-960x629.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1080x707.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul.png 1645w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>

<p>Another day, another Briana DeJesus controversy.</p>



<p>Fresh from allegations that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/kailyn-lowry-blasts-briana-dejesus-i-cant-believe-you-banged-a-teen-mom-2-crew-member/">Briana got the entire Teen Mom security staff fired</a> by conducting an illicit affair with one of the guards, DeJesus is once again receiving some intense criticism.</p>



<p>The new allegations also pertain to on-set safety, but in a very, very different way.</p>



<p>According to a recent report from <em>The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</em>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-and-ashley-jones-fight-during-teen-mom-taping/">Briana was involved in an altercation with Ashley Jones</a> on the set of <em>Teen Mom: Family Reunion</em> in Oregon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The details of the fight are scarce at the moment, but whatever happened, it was bad enough that Briana, Ashley, and their moms were all sent home ahead of schedule.</p>



<p>Ashley is currently pregnant, and it seems that fans of the franchise have been blasting Bri for getting into a physical fight with a woman who&#8217;s expecting.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2022/09/22/briana-dejesus-denies-starting-fight-with-ashley-jones-on-teen-mom-family-reunion-set-claims-shes-received-threatening-messages-for-putting-her-hands-on-a-pregnant-person/">DeJesus took to Instagram</a> to address the allegations, insisting that she would never get into an altercation with a woman whom she knew to be knocked up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Bri took to Instagram to reveal that she&#8217;s received threats for “putting [her] hands on a pregnant person.&#8221;</p>



<p>DeJesus went on to warn her followers that “spreading lies can really get someone hurt,” before insisting she was not the one who caused “any type of mayhem”</p>



<p>“I never even got disrespect[ful] til a pregnant woman– who is accusing me [of knowing] about her pregnancy but never told me– asked if I wanted to fight,&#8221; Bri wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Briana DeJesus smiles big in an episode of Teen Mom 2. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bri went on to hint that it was Ashley who started the fight &#8212; despite the fact that she knew she had a bun in the oven.</p>



<p>“A high risk pregnancy at that…Asking to fight and spitting on ppl. It’s disgusting,” she wrote.</p>



<p>“You can call me every name in the book but I’m gonna have to draw the line at u accusing me of doing s&#8211;t to someone who is pregnant,” DeJesus continued. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ashley Jones got famous on 16 and Pregnant. She&#8217;s now a cast member on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter AND Teen Mom: Family Reunion.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I would never ever ever cross that line. I’m going to protect my name at all costs with this one.”</p>



<p>Bri sounds like she&#8217;s taking this situation very seriously.</p>



<p>And say what you will about the woman, DeJesus has never shown herself to be a liar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="700" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021.jpg" alt="Briana DeJesus in 2021" class="wp-image-416320" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-300x273.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-735x670.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-335x305.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-347x316.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-520x474.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/briana-dejesus-in-2021-640x583.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Briana DeJesus looks rather concerned in this photo from Teen Mom 2, doesn&#8217;t she? (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Plus, the altercation presumably took place on camera, which means the truth will come out eventually.</p>



<p>Until then, however, it&#8217;ll be a case of she-said, she-said.</p>



<p>Of course, Ashley might not have much to say about the situation, as she&#8217;s already got a whole lot on her plate these days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Jones&#8217; husband, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/bar-smith-ashley-jones-husband-locked-up-on-100000-bail-for-dui-weapons-charges/">Bar Smith, was arrested</a> last month, and it seems that he&#8217;s facing prison time for a slew of charges, including unlawful discharge of a firearm, which is a felony.</p>



<p>So yeah, as big as the Bri situation is, it&#8217;s probably pretty small potatoes to Ashley at the moment.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more bad news for Bar Smith this week.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve known for a while that the Teen Mom star and husband of Ashley Jones was in some sort of trouble with the law.</p>



<p>And now it seems that the situation is more serious than we previously thought.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/bar-smith-ashley-jones-husband-arrested-held-without-bail-after-running-from-police/">Bar was arrested</a> in Nevada on August 22, and he was initially held without bail.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ashley Jones and Bariki Smith are pictured here with their daughter. Cute family. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>He was charged with being a fugitive from another state, which is a serious crime, but it could have been the result of a simple misunderstanding.</p>



<p>Bar and Ashley had recently moved from California to Nevada, and many assumed that Smith relocated to a new state without realizing he had a warrant.</p>



<p>But if that were the case, and the charges against Bar were minor, then he would probably be a free man by now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Bar Smith is in serious trouble with the law. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Instead, he&#8217;s been extradited back to California, where he&#8217;s now being held on $100,000 bail.</p>



<p>Yes, according to a <a href="https://starcasm.net/teen-mom-ashley-husband-bar-jail-100000-bond/">new report </a>from Starcasm, the charges against Bar were anything <em>but</em> minor.</p>



<p>Smith&#8217;s warrants stem from previous arrests for DUI and willful discharge of a firearm in a negligent manner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Bar Smith has traded in his stylish gear for a county orange jumpsuit. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Smith, whose real name is Bariki Lockettsmith was taken into custody in March of 2021 for shooting a gun within the city limits of Merced, California, which is a felony.</p>



<p>Bar was not involved in any violence, and it seems his crime was a result of stupidity, rather than conflict.</p>



<p>Ashley had just graduated from community college the day before, and it seems that Bar may have fired off a couple of rounds in celebration of her achievement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Bar and Ashley have been through an awful lot together. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Interestingly, the family relocated to Henderson, Nevada so that Ashley could attend nursing school.</p>



<p>So we guess Bar has a long history of overshadowing Ashley&#8217;s academic progress with his legal troubles.</p>



<p>On Instagram, Bar&#8217;s mother, Shen, explained that her son has been imprisoned over a simple lack of communication regarding warrants and court dates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Bar Smith is in jail and could remain there for quite some time. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“So for the record my son had warrant he didn’t know he had. His lawyer did not call him,” Shen wrote in a post.</p>



<p> “He paid attorney to do a job,” she continued in the comments. </p>



<p>“So if he did not tell him what he needed to tell him, whose fault is that?”</p>



<p>Shen went on to allege that it was Teen Mom producers who leaked the news of Bar&#8217;s legal issues to the media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Bar Smith is currently behind bars in California. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Producers hella funny,” Shen remarked. &#8220;They dropped it quick soon as they were told!” </p>



<p>Bar&#8217;s mom later claimed that “producers leaked it because we all knew before them and we stayed silent.”</p>



<p>Regardless of how word of the arrest got out, it sounds like Bar is in some serious trouble.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>
