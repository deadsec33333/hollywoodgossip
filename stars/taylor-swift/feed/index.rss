<p>Fan speculation that Taylor Swift is pregnant has been spiking.</p>



<p>Taylor and Travis seem to be keeping a low profile. That&#8217;s in stark contrast from recent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-bathroom-bodyguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public appearances</a>.</p>



<p>There can be a few reasons for that, but it&#8217;s a tried-and-true method of hiding a baby bump. We&#8217;ve seen it before.</p>



<p>Is Taylor pregnant? Is she hiding relationship troubles? Or is this something else? Here&#8217;s what we know:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on November 4, 2024." class="wp-image-517640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift arrives before the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay buccaneers at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on November 04, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-in-the-world-is-taylor-swift">Where in the world is Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>A few weeks ago, a super rare video of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce hit the internet. Fans spotted the two in Park City, Utah.</p>



<p>Just days later, the two again went on a low-key outing. This time, a dinner date in New York.</p>



<p>In late March, reports had Taylor and Travis dining with Erin Andrews in Big Sky, Montana. </p>



<p>Notably, she apparently encouraged the two to date in the first place.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Travis Kelce CAUGHT RECORDING Taylor Swift for the iHeartRadio Music Awards Speech..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/swjeic-cfK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Sometimes, when a couple who was once virtually omnipresent starts acting private, it&#8217;s a red flag.</p>



<p>When a romance is on the rocks, people try to avoid public fights. </p>



<p>Especially when they are in the spotlight. Taylor and Travis are one of the planet&#8217;s most famous couples, and she&#8217;s someone who likes to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-wedding-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan ahead</a>.</p>



<p>On the flip side, sometimes there&#8217;s a very different reason to hide. When you want to hide your baby bump, you&#8217;d hide your whole body. And some fans wonder if Taylor is doing just that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apparently-this-famous-couple-just-wants-some-peace-and-quiet">Apparently, this famous couple just wants some peace and quiet</h2>



<p>According to a report by <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/why-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-seemingly-disappeared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>, an inside source assures that Taylor and Travis &#8220;are still very much in love.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider characterized: “They’re simply recharging their batteries.”</p>



<p>Just as many introverts might need some alone time after a busy social event, some famous couples need to back down from whirlwind public appearances to nurture their relationship.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="720" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1024x720.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on September 11, 2024." class="wp-image-514773" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1024x720.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-768x540.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-2048x1440.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-960x675.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1080x759.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1200x844.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards at UBS Arena on September 11, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Taylor’s been in rest-and-relaxation mode since she wrapped her Eras Tour in December,” the source shared.</p>



<p>According to the insider, “the plan has always been to enjoy the off-season with Travis by packing in a lot of travel.” </p>



<p>(The &#8220;off-season&#8221; refers to the months out of the year when football is not happening. We have all learned so much about this sport since Taylor took an interest in Travis)</p>



<p>The sole exception to this down time was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-grammy-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Grammy Awards</a> in February. That&#8217;s pretty <em>can&#8217;t-miss</em> for Taylor, for obvious reasons, even if she doesn&#8217;t always win.</p>

<p>The source went on to say that, after the Super Bowl &#8220;and all the pressure that went with it,&#8221; they needed this.</p>



<p>“He desperately needed a break,&#8221; the insider dished. &#8220;So Taylor surprised him with a super private trip.”</p>



<p>The source elaborated: “They’ve been hitting the slopes in Park City and Big Sky, where they blended right in. It helps that they can cover up their faces when they’re skiing, since most people are wearing helmets, goggles or face coverings. They love the anonymity.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift in August of 2024." class="wp-image-507505" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift performs on stage during the &#8220;Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour&#8221; at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kate Green/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, there is absolutely no proof of a Taylor pregnancy. </p>



<p>There have been no baby bump sightings. Taylor is a conspicuously tall (relatively) and slender woman. Pregnancy would not hide for long.</p>



<p>If some sort of exciting news leaks, we&#8217;ll be thrilled to share it. </p>



<p>But for now, it sounds like Taylor and Travis are just trying to take it easy.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift absolutely crushed it in 2024 — but Beyonce recently claimed a major victory over the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/taylor-swift-brother-austin-fan-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eras Tour</a> icon!</p>



<p>As you may have heard, <em>Billboard</em> has named Bey the top pop star of the 21st century.</p>



<p>And <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/julia-roberts-travis-kelce-swifties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s famously loyal legion of fans</a> are not thrilled with the decision.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-fans-object-to-beyonce-s-latest-achievement">Taylor Swift Fans Object to Beyonce&#8217;s Latest Achievement</h2>



<p>The <em>Billboard</em> list came out gradually over several weeks, so fans knew for a while that Taylor wouldn&#8217;t rise any higher than the number two spot.</p>



<p>Still, when Bey was revealed as the century&#8217;s most dominant pop star, Swifties reacted with outrage.</p>



<p>“Taylor had more impact in the last 5 years than Beyoncé in her whole career ×5,” one Swiftie tweeted, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/03/entertainment/taylor-swift-fans-locked-in-heated-disputes-as-beyonce-is-named-billboards-greatest-pop-star-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>“In other words, because Taylor was 15, Beyoncé had the advantage.. what type of publication is this?&#8221; another asked.</p>



<p>“Influence, evolution, and impact are all 3 words that describe Taylor, btw!” a third chimed in, referring to the publication&#8217;s criteria.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-s-reaction">Taylor&#8217;s Reaction</h2>



<p>And how did Taylor respond to the news that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/beyonce-greatest-pop-stars-21st-century-1235842572/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bey was crowned Queen of the Century</a>?</p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/03/celebrity-news/how-taylor-swift-reacted-to-beyonce-being-named-greatest-pop-star-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a source</a> tells Page Six that she&#8217;s &#8220;really happy for Beyonce” and completely unbothered by the fact that she didn&#8217;t win the title herself.</p>

<p>“Taylor will always support strong female artists and thinks Beyoncé is so deserving of this honor,” said the insider.</p>



<p>No surprise there. While a case could certainly be made for Taylor being the century&#8217;s top pop star, we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s well aware of the enormous impact of Beyonce&#8217;s career.</p>



<p>And the title comes after a year in which Bey shattered even more records and barriers with her <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Carter</a></em> album.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that the <em>Billboard</em> rankings have created controversy. </p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/hailey-bieber/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailey Bieber</a> vented her outrage when Justin came in at number eight on the list.</p>



<p>But ultimately, this seems like the sort of situation that fans care more about than artists.</p>



<p>Some Swifties will probably remain angry over this mild snub, but hey, it&#8217;s not all bad news for Taylor:</p>

<p>She was also named<a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/04/entertainment/taylor-swift-named-spotifys-most-streamed-artist-for-2024-with-over-26-billion-streams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify&#8217;s most-streamed artist</a> of 2024!</p>



<p>Oh, and she&#8217;s fabulously wealthy and arguably the most famous person on the planet.</p>



<p>So yeah, she&#8217;s probably not losing much sleep over the whole <em>Billboard</em> thing.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift agreed to be godmother to Jaime King and Kyle Newman&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/07/jaime-king-gives-birth-to-second-child-see-the-unusual-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">son</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, things have not gone so well for their family. The divorced exes have been in a custody battle over their sons, including <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/07/taylor-swift-meets-godchild-see-the-precious-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s godchild</a>.</p>



<p>Now, family court has ruled on the matter.</p>



<p>Jaime King will no longer be able to have unsupervised visits with her own children.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-court-has-ruled-in-jaime-king-and-kyle-newman-s-custody-battle">The court has ruled in Jaime King and Kyle Newman&#8217;s custody battle</h2>



<p>On March 17, <em><a href="https://people.com/jaime-king-s-ex-husband-kyle-newman-awarded-sole-physical-custody-of-sons-11698300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> reported that the family court ruled that Kyle Newman, ex-husband of Jaime King, will receive sole physical custody of Leo Thames Newman, godson of Taylor Swift. And of his older brother, James.</p>



<p>Leo is 9. James is 11. And while the former couple will share legal custody of the boys, Newman will have &#8220;tie-breaking authority&#8221; in the case of a dispute.</p>



<p>Though Newman receives sole physical custody of their sons, the court ordered that King has visitation rights.</p>

<p>According to family court&#8217;s ruling, Jaime King may see her sons three times per week.</p>



<p>However, these visits must take place during &#8220;specific hour blocks&#8221; and must be supervised.</p>



<p>As for the reason that Taylor Swift now has fewer legal barriers to unsupervised visits with the sons of Jaime King than the mother herself, the court explained this.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-all-of-the-rules-for-jaime-king-visiting-her-sons">Why all of the rules for Jaime King visiting her sons?</h2>



<p>According to <em>People</em>, the court detailed that the restrictions on Jaime King&#8217;s visitation is because she previously received, but did not complete, stipulations.</p>



<p>The court had instructed King to complete a 6-month drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. </p>



<p>She allegedly did not comply.</p>



<p>King also received instructions to complete a 26-week parenting course, undergo weekly testing, and participate in weekly therapy sessions to &#8220;address care issues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently, another requirement is for Jaime King to go to counseling with both James and Leo, but only when a therapist believes that it is appropriate.</p>



<p>All of this comes following multiple allegations that King had problems with drugs and alcohol.</p>



<p>This has tied into their repeated and ongoing custody battles, which began when King filed for divorce in 2020.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-jaime-king-name-taylor-swift-as-leo-s-godmother">Why did Jaime King name Taylor Swift as Leo&#8217;s godmother?</h2>



<p>At the time, Jaime King explained that Taylor Swift would make a perfect godmother because of her morals and her values.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of person I want to be the guide and the spiritual protector of my child,&#8221; she said of her superstar friend at the time.</p>



<p>We hope that all will soon be well for Jaime King and for her sons. This is likely a difficult time for everyone involved.</p>

<p>After taking some down time in the wake of numerous <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-bathroom-bodyguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high profile appearances</a>, Taylor resurfaced to receive some hard-earned awards.</p>



<p>One eye-catching detail snared the attention of fans.</p>



<p>Is Taylor about to launch her long-awaited &#8220;Reputation&#8221; re-record? <em>Please say yes</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-taylor-swift-teasing-a-reputation-re-record">Is Taylor Swift teasing a &#8216;Reputation&#8217; re-record?</h2>



<p>On Monday, March 17, Taylor Swift shared a <a href="https://x.com/tswifterastour/status/1901812177016860789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> message during the iHeartRadio Music Awards 2025.</p>



<p>There, her Eras Tour received honors as the tour of the century.</p>



<p>That may sound premature, but the Eras Tour demolished touring records. </p>



<p>It is a true music success story.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨| Taylor Swift&#39;s acceptance speech for &quot;Tour of the Century&quot; for &#39;The Eras Tour&#39;! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iHeartAwards2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iHeartAwards2025</a><br><br>&quot;This is actually the 2 year anniversary of the first show of The Eras Tour.

<p>In addition to her black sweater and plaid miniskirt, Taylor Swift wore a very distinct Jacquie Aiche necklace.</p>



<p>The necklace has the shape of a snake and is studded with a marquise diamond. </p>



<p>It retails for $9,000, which is an easy buy for the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-net-worth-billionaire-status-forbes-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaire</a>.</p>



<p>Fans very quickly latched onto the snake motif. After all, Taylor <em>Ssswift </em>has a history with snakes.</p>

<p>Another chimed in with: &#8220;Rep tv in the air.&#8221;</p>



<p>As exciting as <em>reptile television</em> might sound, that actually stands for Reputation (Taylor&#8217;s Version).</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">rep tv in the air 🕯️🕯️🕯️ <a href="https://t.co/O5xnQbCxN4">pic.twitter.com/O5xnQbCxN4</a></p>&mdash; ❥ (@dailytaybrina) <a href="https://twitter.com/dailytaybrina/status/1901811261152678043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>In 2016, Kim Kardashian was an instrumental part of a pile-on against Taylor Swift. </p>



<p>In defense of her then-husband, the now proudly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bianca-censori-dumped-kanye-west-because-of-pro-nazi-remarks-insiders-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pro-Hitler Kanye West</a>, Kim posted shadily edited audio recordings from a call with Taylor. </p>



<p>Kim also likened Taylor to a &#8220;snake.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2017, Taylor came out swinging with <em>Reputation</em>. In concert, this meant displaying tremendous cobra imagery and wearing serpentine motifs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reputation-taylor-s-version-is-long-overdue">&#8216;Reputation (Taylor&#8217;s Version)&#8217; is long overdue</h2>



<p>One of the many reasons for which so many people <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ariana-grande-demi-lovato-fire-scooter-braun-insiders-say-justin-bieber-has-also-cut-ties-with-controversial-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loathe Scooter Braun</a> is over the sale of the rights to Taylor&#8217;s music. Taylor did not have the chance to purchase the rights herself.</p>



<p>Thus far, Taylor Swift has re-recorded all but two of her albums. One is <em>Reputation</em>. The other is her self-titled 2006 debut album.</p>



<p>When she re-records both, she will own the entirety of her music catalogue. And fans will get to enjoy a &#8220;Taylor&#8217;s Version&#8221; of every single song.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Taylor Swift is not <em>always</em> a winner.</p>



<p>On Sunday night, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/">Kansas City Chiefs were throttled in the Super Bowl</a> by the Philadelphia Eagles, meaning Swift&#8217;s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, went home a loser.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/did-taylor-swift-get-engaged-fans-left-with-questions-after-travis-kelces-shocking-super-bowl-loss/">he didn&#8217;t propose</a>.</p>



<p>Also? <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-booed-by-hostile-crowd-at-super-bowl-lix/">Swift got booed by fans</a> in attendance inside the New Orleans Superdome. Crazy, right?!?</p>

<p>Making matters even worse for the singer, who is coming off basically the best two-year stretch of any human being&#8217;s existence in all of mankind&#8230; President Donald Trump was also at the game.</p>



<p>When they showed him on the Jumbotron, the man who continually claims he&#8217;ll make America great again received a mostly positive response.</p>



<p>And, yes, Trump noticed the difference between how folks greeted him and how they greeted the singer.</p>



<p>He made sure everyone else on the planet noticed it, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,&#8221; Trump wrote after the Chiefs lost 40-22, adding for all to see on Twitter:</p>



<p>&#8220;She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!&#8221;</p>



<p>Swift, of course, endorsed Kamala Harris in her attempt last fall to defeat Trump in the Presidential Election.</p>



<p>The Commander-in-Chief previously said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-says-taylor-swift-will-pay-a-price-for-kamala-harris-endorsement/">Swift would pay a price</a> for such a decision&#8230; and now he must be enjoying what feels like the last laugh at her expense.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on February 2, 2025 at the Grammy Awards." class="wp-image-518858" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“She’s a very liberal person,” Trump said back in September during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, referring to Swift and her decision to voice her support for Harris after she and her opponent squared off in a debate.</p>



<p>It was a debate that many observers thought Harris won in a landslide, with staunch believers hoping it would be her first step to winning the White House.</p>



<p>Added Trump at the time of Swift:</p>



<p>“She seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s any comfort to Taylor Swift, the greatest female tennis player of all-time has her back.</p>



<p>After making a cameo during Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s halftime performance, tennis legend Serena Williams wrote the following Sunday evening on social media:</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you @taylorswift13 dont listen to those booo!!&#8221;</p>



<p>We love you, too, Tay Tay.</p>

<p>The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills by a score of 32-29 on Sunday night, advancing to their fifth Super Bowl in six seasons and becoming the first-ever professional football to win consecutive titles &#8212; and then have a chance to earn a third in a row.</p>



<p>But whatever, right?</p>



<p>Patrick Mahomes, Schmatrick Mahomes.</p>



<p>We all know why this is such a big deal, don&#8217;t we?</p>

<p><strong>Taylor Swift will be in attendance at the Super Bowl again!</strong></p>



<p>The musician was in a luxury suite in Kansas City on January 26, decked out in head-to-toe Louis Vuitton to cheer on long-term boyfriend Travis Kelce. </p>



<p>After the clock hit all zeroes and confetti started to fall on to the field in the Chiefs&#8217; honor, Swift walked with with Kelce&#8217;s mom, Donna, to find Kelce on the field and celebrate the win.</p>



<p>In romantic fashion, as you can see here:</p>

<p>While onstage for the postgame show, Kelce was his usually bombastic and enthusiastic self, even singing the chorus to &#8220;Get Down Tonight&#8221; by KC and the Sunshine Band at one point in response to a question about being one game away from history.</p>



<p>At another point during the celebration, Swift took Kelce&#8217;s face in her hands and pulled him close for numerous kisses. We&#8217;re getting she gave him a lot more later on in the evening&#8230; if you know what we mean. </p>



<p>Swift brushed back Kelce&#8217;s hair as they chatted and embraced on the field, too, prior to the couple walking away, Kelce&#8217;s arm around his world famous girlfriend.</p>



<p>It was enough to make onlookers either swoon or vomit, depending on how one feels about these two.</p>

<p>Swift will likely <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-private-jet/">take her private plane</a> to New Orleans on Sunday, February 9 for the big game.</p>



<p>Kelce. for his part, only caught two passes in the AFC Championship Game for a total of just 19 yards.</p>



<p>But the Chiefs executed all the plays they had to make throughout the game, while the Bills inexplicably went for a two-point conversion toward the end of the first half and then repeatedly ran quarterback Josh Allen directly into the line of scrimmage on key third and fourth downs&#8230; instead of either giving him a chance to build up momentum and pick his spots via a shotgun formation or running any sort of misdirection in this important spots.</p>



<p>Back to Swift, though, we suppose.</p>



<p>&#8220;Football is awesome, it turns out,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/taylor-swift-named-time-person-of-the-year-finally-opens-up-about-travis-kelce/">Swift told Time Magazine in late October 2023</a>. &#8220;I’ve been missing out my whole life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is the Billie Eilish vs. Taylor Swift rivalry escalating into a full-blown feud?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the question fans are asking after Billie appeared to throw some mild shade at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/taylor-swift-security-costs-travis-kelce-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s Eras Tour</a> during a recent livestream.</p>



<p>Billie noted that she won&#8217;t be putting on any three-hour concerts. And she seemed to condemn artists (like Taylor) who do exactly that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-billie-eilish-shade-taylor-swift">Did Billie Eilish Shade Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>“Nobody wants that,” Billie remarked, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/billie-eilish-shades-taylor-swift-beyonces-three-hour-concerts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>. “You guys don’t want that. I don’t want that. I don’t even want that as a fan.</p>



<p>“Even my favorite artists, I’m not trying to hear them for three hours. That’s far too long,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter) and other platforms, Swifties clapped back at Billie&#8217;s remarks. They noted that many fans <em>do</em> want marathon concerts.</p>

<p>“Millions of people seem to want that but ok,” <a href="https://x.com/taychonne/status/1793967189654958335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s weird saying that when all of the shows were sold out and even made into a movie that ppl bought tickets to also see so saying ‘nobody wants that’ is an actual lie,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/lemy_27/status/1793967616480215477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another added</a>.</p>



<p>Other users came to Billie&#8217;s defense and pointed out that she never mentioned Taylor by name.</p>

<p>In fact, she&#8217;s been known to praise Taylor, Beyonce, and others for their ability to put on massive stadium shows.</p>



<p>“The fact that they can put on a show that long, and it’s filled with so many incredible moments, is really amazing,” Billie gushed to the <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-10-11/billie-eilish-barbie-finneas-what-was-i-made-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a></em> in 2023.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that Billie has been accused of throwing subtle shade at Taylor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-billie-seemed-to-criticize-taylor-for-releasing-multiple-versions-of-the-same-album">Billie Seemed to Criticize Taylor For Releasing Multiple Versions of the Same Album</h2>



<p>“We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it’s very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging,&#8221; Billie said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/billie-eilish-sustainability-eco-friendly-initiatives-mom-1235642455/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a></em>.</p>



<p>She noted that this practice &#8220;ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money&#8221; but is bad for the environment due to &#8220;wasteful&#8221; packaging.</p>



<p>Many fans theorized that the comments were inspired by Taylor&#8217;s decision to release bonus content on the same day that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/billie-eilish-sexuality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billie&#8217;s latest album</a> hit stores.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1024x683.jpg" alt='Billie Eilish attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An Anthology of Fashion" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.' class="wp-image-500670" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Billie Eilish attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;In America: An Anthology of Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Eilish clarified that she had no intention of “singling anyone out,&#8221; noting that the practice is an “industry-wide systemic issue.”</p>



<p>“Okay so it would be so awesome if people would stop putting words into my mouth and actually read what I said,” she wrote on <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/01/entertainment/billie-eilish-hits-back-at-taylor-swift-fans-over-wasteful-packaging-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. </p>



<p>“When it comes to variants, so many artists release them, including me, which I clearly state in the article.”</p>



<p>Taylor has not publicly responded to any of this alleged shame. But if we&#8217;re lucky, maybe she&#8217;ll clap back in song form.</p>

<p>Yes, when her Eras Tour stopped at Wembley Stadium in London, Taylor took the time to pose for a selfie with the Prince of Wales and his eldest kids.</p>



<p>And not surprisingly, that memorable moment was included in Will and Kate&#8217;s Instagram post celebrating their favorite photo ops from 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy New Year! Wishing you all a wonderful 2025,&#8221; the couple captioned their annual Instagram carousel.</p>

<p>Commenters were split on the couple&#8217;s decision to include Taylor in their reminiscences, but that&#8217;s only because it&#8217;s 2025, and social media users feel compelled to argue about literally <em>everything</em> these days.</p>



<p>Thankfully, everyone seemed to be in agreement that through the grace and poise she demonstrated in 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-queen-ready-health-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate showed she&#8217;s got what it takes to be queen</a>.</p>



<p>William previously described 2024 as a &#8220;brutal&#8221; year, and insiders have called it the most difficult of his life.</p>

<p>In addition to Kate&#8217;s battle with cancer, the royals&#8217; lives intersected with Taylor&#8217;s a second time, and this occasion was not as joyous as their backstage meet-and-greet.</p>



<p>In July, young <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/kate-middleton-invites-taylor-swift-fans-victimized-by-knife-attack-to-christmas-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attendees of a Taylor-themed dance class</a> were victimized by a seemingly random attack from a knife-wielding assailant.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-responds-to-horrific-stabbing-at-event-inspired-by-iconic-singer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor was quick to offer her support</a> to the survivors and the loved ones of the three children who were killed.</p>

<p>William and Kate later traveled to Sourthport, England to meet with the victims and their families. And Kate rounded out the year by inviting people affected by the attack to her Christmas concert.</p>



<p>So while Kate may not have had the opportunity to meet Taylor, the two women are forever bonded by their compassionate, courageous response to a senseless tragedy.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re both hopeful that there are better times ahead in 2025.</p>

<p>Between an international concert tour and catching her boyfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/travis-kelce-missing-taylor-swift-last-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce&#8217;s NFL games</a>, there&#8217;s plenty of reason that Taylor would need easy air travel. </p>



<p>Now that her tour is done, some viewers are calculating just how much the &#8220;All Too Well&#8221; singer was flying throughout the year. Plus, they&#8217;re tracking the environmental impact of all the jet fuel.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve made the friendship bracelets, taken the moment and tasted it, keep reading to learn more about Taylor Swift&#8217;s private jet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-type-of-private-jet-does-she-have">What Type Of Private Jet Does She Have?</h2>



<p>Taylor&#8217;s private jet is a Dassault Falcon 7X, which is reportedly excellent for both domestic and international flights.

<p>The plane comfortably holds about 16 people, and she has customized the interior with plush seats, an entertainment system, and a dining area.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Chalk it up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a>, but many fans became aware of Taylor&#8217;s frequent flights from the <a href="https://x.com/SwiftJetNextDay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift Jets (Tracking) </a>account on X (formerly Twitter). </p>



<p>The social media account, which has almost 100,000 followers, regularly shares flight maps for Taylor&#8217;s trips. It also includes approximate flight times, jet fuel used, cost of jet fuel, and carbon emissions.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Taylor&#8217;s lawyers sent Jack Sweeney, who runs the account, a cease-and-desist letter. They warned that it could aid stalkers in finding out where the popstar is at any given time, per <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-private-jet-jack-sweeney-responds-cease-and-desist-lawyers-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a></em>. </p>



<p>Jack&#8217;s lawyers responded to the lawsuit by noting that the information was publicly available, and it was classified as protected speech. The account claims that the information is only shared 24 hours after the flights.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Look What You Made Me Do <a href="https://t.co/kETxWamSP3">pic.twitter.com/kETxWamSP3</a></p>— Jack Sweeney (@Jxck_Sweeney) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jxck_Sweeney/status/1759711591358951461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2024</a></blockquote>



<p>In February 2024, Jack posted his response to the lawsuit and quoted Taylor&#8217;s song in a tweet. &#8220;Look What You Made Me Do,&#8221; he wrote. Jack also shares Elon Musk&#8217;s private jet usage and faced a similar legal threat from him.</p>

<p>Many environmental activists believe that Taylor needs to calm down on the private flights. The singer has reportedly bought double the amount of carbon credits needed to cover her tour, according to <em>GlobeAir</em>. </p>



<p>Still, some people have criticized the carbon credits response. Northeastern University Political Thought Professor Callum Barrell told <em><a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/08/14/taylor-swift-private-jet-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northeastern Global News </a></em>that he finds that approach to be &#8220;lazy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The fact that she is kind of washing her hands of it by saying, ‘Well, I’ve got carbon credits — that’s fine.’ You basically pay extra for emitting all of this carbon and I think that is greenwashing and lazy,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>In June 2024, climate activists Just Stop Oil sent Taylor a message by spray painting a jet that was parked in the same facility she uses, per <em><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/taylor-swifts-jet-spared-activists-orange-paint/a-69430515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DW</a>.</em> Police later confirmed that the singer&#8217;s plane was not there though.</p>



<p>Besides activists, Taylor&#8217;s jet usage has also sparked a debate within the Swiftie community. Scroll through fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftlyNeutral/comments/1c3n12q/taylors_jet_use_in_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">groups</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwiftJets/comments/1ey08fp/taylor_swifts_falcon_7x_landed_in_nashville/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, and there are tons of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1alg47y/how_do_people_expect_taylor_swift_to_handle_her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussions</a> about her flight usage. </p>



<p>While many people feel that she overuses her private jet, some also note that Taylor&#8217;s level of fame would make normal air travel difficult. </p>

<p>Now that the Eras Tour has wrapped, people are looking into how much Taylor has been flying in 2024. The &#8220;Anti-Hero&#8221; singer reportedly logged 225 flight hours this year, according to <em><a href="https://qz.com/emails/daily-brief/1851716023/daily-brief-taylor-swift-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quartz</a></em>.</p>



<p>The outlet also reported that Taylor&#8217;s plane used over 80,000 gallons of jet fuel and led to 768 metric tons of carbon emissions. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear what the future has in store for Taylor&#8217;s private jet usage, but now that the<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-tour-another-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eras Tour is done</a>, she won&#8217;t need to fly to various cities to  perform on a regular basis.</p>
