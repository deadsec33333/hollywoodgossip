<p>Is Carrie Underwood pregnant?</p>



<p>The former <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/katy-perry-american-idol-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a></em> champion has become one of the music world&#8217;s most beloved stars, and fans are always clamoring for new information about her personal life.</p>



<p>And while she values her family&#8217;s privacy, Carrie posts to social media frequently, and she&#8217;s usually happy to share updates about her time away from the recording studio.</p>



<p>But while fans might continue to bombard her with questions about whether or not she plans to expand her family, Carrie has mostly kept quiet on that issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-kids-does-carrie-already-have">How Many Kids Does Carrie Already Have?</h2>



<p>Carrie married hockey player Mike Fisher in 2010, and the couple has since welcomed two children.</p>



<p>And while Carrie has never explicitly stated that she&#8217;s done having kids, it looks as though she&#8217;s satisfied with the current size of her family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-carrie-underwood-pregnant-today">Is Carrie Underwood Pregnant Today?</h2>



<p>It does not look as though Carrie Underwood is currently pregnant, and based on her comments on the subject, it seems that she&#8217;s not planning to welcome another kid anytime soon.</p>



<p>During a 2019 appearance on <em>Today</em>, <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/505203/carrie-underwood-baby-number-three-pregnancy-comments-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie was asked point-blank</a> if she plans to welcome more kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not know at this point,&#8221; she told host Natalie Morales (via <em>Hello!</em>). </p>

<p>&#8220;You know, it&#8217;s such a difficult road to get where we are now. And I&#8217;ll have to evaluate after this tour is over,&#8221; the country star continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then we can talk about what&#8217;s next. But I&#8217;ve been a lot of kind of &#8216;live in the moment&#8217; lately. And I think that&#8217;s good. I am kind of a planner and I really do like knowing what&#8217;s around every corner.</p>



<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anything the past couple of years have taught me is that you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gonna happen next.&#8221;</p>



<p>With all of the ups and downs she&#8217;s endured in her life, Carrie can speak from experience about the futility of planning too far ahead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrie-s-difficult-pregnancy-journey">Carrie&#8217;s Difficult Pregnancy Journey </h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/09/carrie-underwood-opens-up-about-trio-of-heartbreaking-miscarriag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie suffered three miscarriages</a> in between the births of her two sons, and she&#8217;s been candid about the heartbreak of those tragedies.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way you can plan for everything or make everything be the way you want it,&#8221; she once said.</p>



<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s been good for me to just kind of be present, and live in the moment, and stop trying so hard to plan out the entire rest of my life.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/08/carrie-underwood-im-too-darn-old-to-have-more-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie has hinted that she might one day adopt a child</a>, but it seems that at the moment, she&#8217;s fully focused on her career and her two sons.</p>

<p>&#8220;This tour, I&#8217;m going home a lot more than I ever have before. If there&#8217;s a way to get me home, even if it&#8217;s just for the day,&#8217; she said at the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-carrie-underwood-still-married">Is Carrie Underwood Still Married?</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Carrie has been married to Mike Fisher for quite some time.</p>



<p>Recently, there have been rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/carrie-underwood-divorce-mike-fisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie and Mike are headed for divorce</a>. But it seems that that&#8217;s nothing more than tabloid speculation.</p>



<p>Mike stood by his wife&#8217;s side when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/carrie-underwood-face-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie injured her face</a> in an accident in 2023, and it looks as though these two have never been stronger.</p>

<p>These days, Carrie&#8217;s career is reaching new heights, and Mike seems more than happy to provide all the support she needs.</p>



<p>Yes, it sounds like Carrie has achieved the ideal balance between her career and her family life.</p>



<p>And while she hasn&#8217;t completely closed the door on welcoming another child, it seems that she&#8217;s perfectly content with her current situation.</p>

<p>All across the country, plenty of observers are judging Carrie Underwood at the moment.</p>



<p>As they do so, a common question is now being asked:</p>



<p><strong>Will Carrie Underwood return next season to judge contestants on American Idol?</strong></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516915" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2176175940-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, Carrie Underwood, and Ryan Seacrest pose for a photo during &#8220;American Idol&#8221; Season 8 Judges Photo Call on October 2, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The artist was chosen this week to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-trump-inauguration/">perform at Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration</a> on Monday, January 20&#8230; but instead of receiving messages of congratulations from folks around the nation, Underwood has instead received a great deal of backlash.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t need to delve into <em>why</em>, do we?</p>



<p>Donald Trump has been elected President on <em>two</em> separate occasions, yet he&#8217;s likely the most polarizing person on the planet &#8212; with many believing he&#8217;s a racist, a rapist, a fascist or some combination of all these things.</p>



<p>And the singer is clearly aware of some of the negative responses out there.</p>

<p>“I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-im-not-maga-i-just-love-america/">Underwood said in a statement</a> to People Magazine a couple days ago, adding:</p>



<p>“I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”</p>



<p>Back in January 2017, Trump was turned down by a number of musicians who were asked to fill a similar role at his first inauguration.</p>



<p>In the end, 3 Doors Down, Toby Keith, Big &amp; Rich and Jackie Evancho were among a number of stars who signed on to take part in this celebration of the transition of power.</p>

<p>According to the Sun, meanwhile, American Idol producers are &#8220;not happy&#8221; that Underwood has entered the political fray in any matter whatsoever.</p>



<p>But this doesn&#8217;t mean the celebrity is about to get the heave-ho.</p>



<p>“Carrie’s job is not in jeopardy,&#8221; an <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/13302962/carrie-underwood-future-american-idol-revealed-blindsided-inauguration/">insider told the aforementioned</a> publication, emphasizing there has been “no talks of firing her. She will continue her role as a judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The source went on:</p>



<p>“It doesn’t conflict with any of her Idol taping dates and [the inauguration] is before this season airs, so it doesn’t go against anything in her contract.</p>



<p>“But there are producers that don’t approve and are worried.&#8221;</p>



<p>Why? Because there&#8217;s been social media talk of an American Idol boycott and because executives simply had no idea this was a possibility.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone at the show knew about Carrie singing at the inauguration ahead of it coming out, it caught them all off guard&#8230; They don’t want the show to get political, they want it to be an escape from that.&#8221; this person said.</p>



<p>The goal of American Idol is to focus on entertainment only, The Sun explains, adding that Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie and Ryan Seacrest are far from psyched over their colleague&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>Underwood will be joined by performers including Kid Rock, the Village People, Billy Ray Cyrus, Lee Greenwood, Rascal Flatts, Jason Aldean and more over the weekend and Monday as part of Trump‘s inauguration events in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>An eight-time Grammy winner, Underwood will sing “America The Beautiful” at the swearing-in ceremony&#8230; with accompaniment from the Armed Forces Chorus and the United States Naval Academy Glee Club.</p>

<p>Carrie Underwood is rushing to her own defense.</p>



<p>The former American Idol champion has been booked to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-trump-inauguration/">perform at Donald Trump&#8217;s Presidential inauguration</a> on Monday, January 20.</p>



<p>This booking is not sitting well with many social media users because a bunch of people believe Trump to be a fascist, racist and/or rapist.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/donald-trump-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-hush-money-trial/">also a convicted felon</a>.</p>

<p>According to a various celebrity gossip sources, the artist will sing “America the Beautiful” next Monday &#8212; with accompaniment from the Armed Forces Chorus and the United States Naval Academy Glee Club.</p>



<p>Clearly aware of the backlash this decision has generated, Underwood released a statement on January 13.</p>

<p>Back in January 2017, Trump was turned down by a number of artists who were asked to fill a similar role.</p>



<p>In the end, 3 Doors Down, Toby Keith, Big &amp; Rich and Jackie Evancho were among a handful of stars who signed on to take part in this celebration of the transition of power.</p>



<p>Underwood, for her part, has never been especially political or outspoken on topics that impact most Americans.</p>



<p>She did seem to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/carrie-underwood-promotes-anti-mask-tweet-gets-absolutely-roaste/">come out as being anti-mask</a> during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, if anyone out there has thoughts on that opinion and what it says of her.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516774" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2157530851-scaled.jpg 1708w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood attends the 2024 Songwriters Hall Of Fame Induction and Awards Gala at New York Marriott Marquis Hotel on June 13, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Joy Malone/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins,&#8221; Underwood told The Guardian in 2019. &#8220;It’s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it’s black and white. And it’s not like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2018, though, some observers believed Underwood&#8217;s single &#8220;The Bullet&#8221; was some kind of political statement.</p>



<p><em>You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns/But mamas ain&#8217;t supposed to bury their sons</em>, she sings in the first verse. <em>Left a hole in her heart and it still ain&#8217;t done/The bullet keeps on goin.&#8217;</em></p>



<p>Said Underwood years ago of the respond:</p>



<p>&#8220;Immediately people said, ‘Oh you have a song about gun control!’ It was more about the lives that were changed by something terrible happening.</p>



<p>&#8220;And it does kind of bug me when people take a song, or take something I said and try to pigeonhole or force me to pick a side or something. It’s a discussion &#8212; a long discussion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is a Carrie Underwood divorce going down?</p>



<p>From Carrie Underwood&#8217;s storied music career to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/carrie-underwood-face-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her nasty accident</a> a few years ago, the Country singer has fame and fans to spare.</p>



<p>She also has a husband, Mike Fisher.</p>



<p>However, some wonder if they&#8217;ll have each other for much longer.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-1024x683.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher in April of 2022." class="wp-image-506949" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_01_mikefisher-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher attend the 2022 CMT Music Awards at Nashville Municipal Auditorium on April 11, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-could-lead-to-a-mike-fisher-and-carrie-underwood-divorce">What could lead to a Mike Fisher and Carrie Underwood divorce?</h2>



<p>Earlier this summer, Carrie Underwood performed in Hawai&#8217;i in a concert. This was a work trip, but she didn&#8217;t keep it entirely professional.</p>



<p>Husband Mike Fisher tagged along. The idea was that this would also be a romantic getaway for the couple, who have been married since 2010.</p>



<p>According to a recent report, tensions were brewing during the trip &#8212; with Mike feeling like his Country superstar wife was neglecting him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="677" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-1024x677.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood on August 2, 2024." class="wp-image-506950" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-768x508.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-2048x1354.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-960x635.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-1080x714.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0812_carrieunderwood_03-1200x793.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood performs on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; at Rumsey Playfield, Central Park on August 02, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em><a href="https://www.globemagazine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Globe Magazine</a></em> reports that Carrie Underwood&#8217;s focus on performing had Mike Fisher feeling &#8220;left out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was supposed to be a vacation in paradise,&#8221; the inside source characterized of the trip. A trip which, we cannot help but recall, was primarily a work trip.</p>



<p>&#8220;But she was either working or with her band,&#8221; the insider griped. &#8220;And Mike felt left out.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reportedly-mike-fisher-felt-sidelined">Reportedly, Mike Fisher felt sidelined</h2>



<p>&#8220;Sure, she posed for snaps with him,&#8221; the source then acknowledged.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the insider went on to lament, &#8220;she was consumed with work.&#8221;</p>



<p>If the report about their conflict is legit, that could be a long-term problem. Later in August, Underwood will pick up where she left off with her Vegas residency. If Fisher continues allegedly feeling like he&#8217;s second fiddle, a Carrie Fisher divorce could loom on the horizon.</p>

<p>But Carrie Underwood won&#8217;t be abandoning her family. Mike Fisher and their 9-year-old, Isaiah and 5-year-old, Jacob, are set to join her in the city.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mike will go with her but more as kid-sitter than lover,&#8221; the inside source characterized. &#8220;He’s longing for some alone time with his wife, but there isn’t much opportunity for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the insider: &#8220;She always promises to make more time for him but then before long she’s back to making life all about work, or the kids, with Mike feeling stuck in last place.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-s-reportedly-jealous-of-her-success">He&#8217;s Reportedly &#8216;Jealous&#8217; of Her Success</h2>



<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t the first time murmurs have reached our ears that there&#8217;s trouble in paradise. </p>



<p>For years, gossip has spread far and wide that the pair have had trouble keeping the spark of their marriage alive. In 2022, for instance, Ok Magazine reported that their marriage was actually &#8220;plagued by jealousy&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;She puts on a happy show for the cameras, but there&#8217;s a lot going on behind the scenes,&#8221; the source spilled to the publication.</p>



<p>For her part,  the tipping point was during the pandemic. </p>



<p>&#8220;Carrie used to feel insecure in the marriage. During lockdown, the tables turned,&#8221; said the insider of the duo, who wed in 2010. &#8220;Little things about Mike annoyed her.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, on Mike&#8217;s part, it goes far deeper than that. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mike is seeing even less of Carrie. He goes crazy thinking about all of the guys she&#8217;s closely working with, like Jason [Alden],&#8221; the source added. </p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll sometimes hit the bar and get drunk with his friends as a distraction or because he&#8217;s bored or feeling lonely.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-carrie-underwood-divorce-really-happening">Is a Carrie Underwood divorce really happening?</h2>



<p>The truth is, all of this information is coming from supposed folks from within their inner circle. back in 2022, the source that spoke to OK! called their marriage so &#8220;bad&#8221; that they were sure a divorce was immenent.</p>



<p> &#8220;They&#8217;ve tried everything to make things work — therapy, couples retreats — but nothing seems to help. Carrie and Mike act like strangers half of the time,&#8221; the insider insisted. </p>



<p>But again, that was two years ago and while the rumors persist, they still haven&#8217;t parted ways. </p>



<p>However, Carrie Underwood&#8217;s upcoming career move &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/carrie-underwood-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing Katy Perry on <em>American Idol</em></a> (which seems to be part of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-voice-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing trend</a> of letting Country dominate these singing competitions) &#8212; could take her away from home even more.</p>



<p>Perhaps, if these tensions are real, they&#8217;ll find a way to work through them. Fourteen years of marriage sounds like something worth fighting for, unless there are other issues at play. If Mike Fisher and Carrie Underwood divorce, they&#8217;ll find themselves starting their lives over.</p>

<p>Do you remember the story with Carrie Underwood, her face, and her horrible accident?!</p>



<p>Several years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/carrie-underwood-got-50-stitches-in-her-face-ouch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Underwood received 50 stitches</a> to her face following a pretty nasty injury.</p>



<p>Her recovery was not as simple or painless as she might have hoped. </p>



<p>There was a lasting effect on her psyche &#8212; and on her face. Now that the <em>American Idol</em> winner is returning to her roots, let&#8217;s go back and look at what happened and how her accident still affects her today. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrie-underwood-s-accident-what-happened">Carrie Underwood&#8217;s Accident: What Happened? </h2>



<p>In the spring and summer of 2024, Carrie Underwood&#8217;s appearance during performances and on social media prompted some discussions among fans.</p>



<p>Yes, her face looks different than it once did. Is that just a normal product of aging? Or are fans still seeing the long-term visual markers of her terrible accident?</p>



<p>Underwood&#8217;s injuries are no secret, but they happened so long ago that some fans need a refresher on what exactly happened to nearly seven years ago. </p>

<p>In November of 2017, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/carrie-underwood-pregnant-does-she-want-more-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Underwood</a> received some nasty injuries after a tragic fall.</p>



<p>There was no scandal. It didn&#8217;t involve a crime, or any illicit substances, or anyone trying to harm her.</p>



<p>Instead, Carrie Underwood received injuries to her face and body after falling while walking her dogs. Yes, it can happen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrie-underwood-s-face-suffered-injuries-as-well-some-broken-bones">Carrie Underwood&#8217;s Face Suffered Injuries, As Well Some Broken Bones</h2>



<p>The results of Carrie Underwood&#8217;s accident included a broken wrist and serious injuries to her face.</p>



<p>After being rushed to urgent care, medical experts at the hospital gave her about 50 stitches above her lip.</p>



<p>She also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/tori-roloff-shares-heartbreaking-photo-reveals-son-underwent-sur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="2">underwent surgery</a> for her broken wrist. Not all bone breaks require surgery, so that sounds <em>extra </em>painful. Sometimes, even a &#8220;simple&#8221; fall can have catastrophic consequences.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood on June 13 of 2024." class="wp-image-506140" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood performs onstage during the 2024 Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction and Awards Gala at New York Marriott Marquis Hotel on June 13, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Bennett Raglin/Getty Images  for Songwriters Hall Of Fame)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZP6AVs8Xmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Bobby Bones</em> podcast</a>, Carrie Underwood detailed her accident.</p>



<p>“I was taking the dogs out and I just, I tripped,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;There was one step and I didn’t let go of the leashes. Priorities!&#8221;</p>



<p>Underwood summarized at the time: &#8220;So that’s why my left hand’s fine. But I went to catch myself and I just missed a step.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-were-the-long-term-consequences-for-carrie-underwood-s-face">What were the long-term consequences for Carrie Underwood&#8217;s face?</h2>



<p>The accident that befell Carrie Underwood resulted in stitches on her face and surgery on her wrist. All of that took time to heal.</p>



<p>In November of 2018, about one year after her fateful fall, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/carrie-underwood-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Underwood spoke</a> to <em>Vulture </em>about the stitches meant limited mobility for her face.</p>



<p>This mean that, in the studio, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/sara-evans-husband-just-got-arrested-for-trying-to-run-country-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="3">Country singer</a> felt the impact upon her vocal performance. It&#8217;s pretty normal to move your face when you sing, after all.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="705" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-1024x705.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood in October of 2018." class="wp-image-506141" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-300x206.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-768x528.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-2048x1409.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-960x661.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-1080x743.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0802_carrieunderwood_05-1200x826.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood attends the 2018 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on October 9, 2018.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images For dcp)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There was also, she recalled, a psychological aftereffect to the fall. She began to doubt her own ability to measure up while her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/kim-kardashian-covers-entire-face-body-in-outrageous-met-gala-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="1">face and body</a> recovered.</p>



<p>“I would sing something and then look at [producer] David [Garcia] and be like, ‘Did that all come out clearly?’” Underwood described to <em>Vulture</em>.</p>



<p>That all sounds very painful. While Carrie Underwood can be <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/carrie-underwood-promotes-anti-mask-tweet-gets-absolutely-roaste/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerously wrong</a> from time to time, we wouldn&#8217;t wish such a painful experience on anyone. She seems to be fully recovered. We hope that this is the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>A few lucky ladies have been the girlfriend of Chace Crawford.</p>



<p>For most, Chace Crawford first caught people&#8217;s attention when he starred on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/12/gossip-girl-throwback-photo-attention-upper-east-siders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the OG <em>Gossip Girl</em></a>, back before The CW was purchased and scrapped for parts.</p>



<p>Though that sort of hit can easily create one-note has-been actors, it hasn&#8217;t slowed him down. Among other projects, he has one of the most memorable roles on <em>The Boys</em>. Which is saying a lot.</p>



<p>Chace Crawford&#8217;s relationship history isn&#8217;t quite as high profile as the actor himself, however. But it&#8217;s also not a secret.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-681x1024.jpg" alt="Chace Crawford smiling handsomely in early January of 2024." class="wp-image-502155" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-768x1155.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-1362x2048.jpg 1362w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-638x960.jpg 638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-718x1080.jpg 718w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-798x1200.jpg 798w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_01-scaled.jpg 1702w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chace Crawford attends the 2024 Astra TV Awards at Millennium Biltmore Hotel Los Angeles on January 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-has-dated-chace-crawford">Who has dated Chace Crawford?</h2>



<p>Anyone tuning into the OG <em>Gossip Girl</em> series couldn&#8217;t help but notice the jarringly handsome Chace Crawford as Nate Archibald.</p>



<p>That hasn&#8217;t changed on <em>The Boys</em>. Except that his character, The Deep, is a less likable person. A <em>considerably </em>less likable person. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a testament to Crawford&#8217;s versatility as an actor that he can pull off both famous roles.</p>

<p>On June 12, Chace Crawford opened up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUKbFxKgEpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Call Her Daddy</em> podcast</a>, revealing that he&#8217;d hooked up with another Gossip Girl alum.</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t share who it was &#8212; and he may not have been referring to a member of the main cast.</p>



<p>This is more open than he tends to be about romance. He keeps his relationships close to his chest &#8230; and has been able to avoid a lot of weird drama as a result. But even so, we know of some of his past romances.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chace-crawford-and-carrie-underwood">Chace Crawford and Carrie Underwood</h2>



<p>In May of 2007, Chace Crawford began dating <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/carrie-underwood-pregnant-does-she-want-more-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Country singer Carrie Underwood</a>. This was during the absolute pinnacle of <em>Gossip Girl</em>&#8216;s cherished grip upon popular culture.</p>



<p>The two hit things off quickly and dated for nearly a year. He even traveled with her when she went on tour.</p>



<p>They broke up in April of 2008. In fact, according to Underwood, their breakup happened via text.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood in June of 2024." class="wp-image-502158" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_carrieunderwood_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood attends the 2024 Songwriters Hall Of Fame Induction and Awards Gala at New York Marriott Marquis Hotel on June 13, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Joy Malone/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Presumably, Chace Crawford had other relationships between April of 2008 and March of 2013.</p>



<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s no shame in a 5-year dry spell. But famous actors who also happen to be ludicrously handsome are less likely to experience those than others.</p>



<p>However, in 2013, he began dating fellow actor (and model) Rachelle Goulding.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rachelle Goulding in August of 2019." class="wp-image-502159" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_rachellegoulding_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachelle Goulding attends the 15th Annual Oscar Qualifying HollyShorts Film Festival &#8211; Opening Night Gala at TCL Chinese 6 Theatres on August 08, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chace-crawford-dated-rachelle-goulding">Chace Crawford dated Rachelle Goulding</h2>



<p>In March of 2013, both Chace and Rachelle were living &#8212; and working &#8212; in New York.</p>



<p>When Chace later moved to Los Angeles, the two ended up breaking up. That makes sense.</p>



<p>By 2014, Chace looked back upon their relationship on <em>The Kyle and Jackie O Show</em> by saying that they &#8220;had fun.&#8221; We certainly hope so. Otherwise, why be together?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tomer Capone, Nathan Mitchell, Chace Crawford, Claudia Doumit, and Karl Urban in 2022." class="wp-image-502157" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tomer Capone, Nathan Mitchell, Chace Crawford, Claudia Doumit, and Karl Urban speak to the media during the Prime Video Presents UK media event at at The Londoner Hotel on May 19, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Amazon Prime Video)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, in 2015, Chace Crawford met someone else on the show <em>Blood &amp; Oil</em>.</p>



<p>Rebecca Rittenhouse is an actor (with an unfortunate surname that is not her fault, obviously).</p>



<p>Even though the two are both actors and thus somewhat public figures, they avoided the public eye with their romance.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="744" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-1024x744.jpg" alt="Chace Crawford and Rebecca Rittenhouse in August of 2015." class="wp-image-502160" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-300x218.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-768x558.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-2048x1487.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-960x697.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-1080x784.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0617_chacecrawford_05_rebeccarittenhouse-1200x871.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chace Crawford and Rebecca Rittenhouse speak onstage during the &#8216;Blood &amp; Oil&#8217; panel discussion at the ABC Entertainment portion of the 2015 Summer TCA Tour at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on August 5, 2015.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Frederick M.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chace-crawford-and-rebecca-rittenhouse">Chace Crawford and Rebecca Rittenhouse</h2>



<p>Unlike those last two somewhat-high-profile relationships, this lasted longer. Chace Crawford and Rebecca Rittenhouse remained boyfriend and girlfriend until 2018.</p>



<p>It appears that they had a very amicable breakup. They continued to share and co-parent their dog, even walking the pup together in March of 2020.</p>



<p>In 2021, the exes even vacationed together &#8212; with friends. They had not rekindled their romance, however, as <em>TMZ </em>reported that they <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/07/11/chace-crawford-not-back-with-ex-rebecca-rittenhouse-despite-vaca-pics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were simply &#8220;great friends.&#8221;</a> Good for them!</p>

<p>Or maybe take a Louisville Slugger to both of her car&#8217;s headlights.</p>
<p>And, you know what?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t blame them.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Tuesday, the former American Idol champion shared a message from conservative commentator Matt Walsh.</p>
<p>&quot;Here is my speech to the Nashville School Board where I spoke out against the cruel and indefensible mask mandate for children,&quot; wrote Walsh to explain the affiliated clip.</p>
<p>The topic of whether or not kids returning to school late this summer ought to be <em>required</em> to cover their faces when indoors is one of the most hotly-debated topics across every state in the country right now.</p>
<p>On one side, misguided individuals seem to believe this is a matter of freedom and/or personal choice.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On the other side, those who believe in science and medicine and who trust the experts in these fields believe this is a matter of public health.</p>
<p>Over the last several weeks, there&#8217;s been an enormous uptick in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths due to the onslaught of the Delta Variant, which is far more contagious than the originall version of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>According to the Tennessee Health Department, only 48% of eligible Nashville residents are vaccinated.</p>
<p>As a result, more than half of the population over 12 years old are especially susceptible to this virus &#8212; while no child <em>under</em> the age of 12 is vaccinated.</p>

<p>And yet&#8230; somehow, for some incomprehensible reason&#8230; the issue of mask-wearing among this vulnerable population is not only unsettled.</p>
<p>It has turned into a fierce political debate.</p>
<p>Few observers are surprised where Walsh stands on the topic.</p>
<p>But quite a significant handful are stunned that Underwood appears to share his anti-masking view.</p>

<p>In the video he posted online, Walsh railed against the school board forcing boys and girls to wear masks at school, shouting:</p>
<p>&quot;I have listened to your arguments and i&#8217;ve noticed they are missing a few things, namely evidence, data, science, common sense and basic human dignity.&quot;</p>
<p>He ranted about his completely mistaken belief Covid-19 poses no risk to children&#8230; and was applauded by half the room.</p>
<p>Walsh argued that mandating children to wear masks was a form of &quot;child abuse&quot; and said he opposes &quot;teaching them that the air is toxic that everyone around them is sick.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="404" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood at 2018 CMAs" class="wp-image-314201" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas.jpg 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas-335x210.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas-347x218.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas-520x326.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/carrie-underwood-at-2018-cmas-640x401.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The guy is a dangerous moron, and he&#8217;s now using the Underwood controversy to drum up further support and attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Carrie Underwood liked my video and now the mob is coming for her.</p>
<p>&quot;She should know better than to like something that they don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unforgivable sin,&quot; Walsh wrote in sarcastic fashion after seeing the backlash that quickly came the artist&#8217;s way.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-683x1024.jpg" alt="Underwood" class="wp-image-308950" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/underwood-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>He added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long before Carrie Underwood officially renounces me? I give it 12 hours, tops.</p>
<p>&quot;I could be wrong though. I&rsquo;m basing this on our general experience with celebrities who face public backlash from the left.</p>
<p>&quot;In fairness, she could be the outlier. Time will tell.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="888" height="814" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs.png" alt="Carrie Underwood on CBS" class="wp-image-308948" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs.png 888w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-300x275.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-768x704.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-735x674.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-335x307.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-347x318.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-520x477.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-on-cbs-640x587.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(CBS)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Walsh then sent out one final sarcastic, self-aggrandizing tweet.</p>
<p><em>Like anyone else, I am upset and disturbed that Carrie Underwood liked one of my tweets. </em></p>
<p><em>She should know better than to indirectly endorse the opinions of an extremist and scoundrel such as myself.&#8217;</em></p>
<p><em>Her lack of judgment is appalling. I demand that she renounce me and apologize.</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Underwood has not yet commented on the scandal.</p>
<p>Although she has voiced support for progressive issues (namely gay marriage) in the past, she also said once that she prefers to &ldquo;stay far out of politics,&nbsp; at least in public, because nobody wins.&quot;</p>
<p>In this case, at least one person has very clearly lost.</p>
