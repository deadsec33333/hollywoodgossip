<p>Sad news out of the music world today, as Eminem&#8217;s mother, Debbie Nelson, has passed away at the age of 69.</p>



<p>The rapper&#8217;s strained relationship with Debbie inspired several of his songs and some of the more harrowing scenes in his 2002 biographical film <em>8 Mile</em>.</p>



<p>But the relationship between mother and son improved in recent years, and Debbie publicly congratulated Em on his induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-800227-651x1024.jpg" alt="Eminem's mother Debbie Mathers exits a Macomb County Court courtroom following his sentencing on concealed weapons charges April 10, 2001 in Michigan.

<p>The reconciliation began nearly a decade prior, when Em released the song &#8220;Headlights,&#8221; in which he expressed his regret over his earlier verbal attacks on Debbie.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-debbie-nelson-s-cause-of-death-revealed">Debbie Nelson&#8217;s Cause of Death Revealed</h2>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/eminems-estranged-mom-terminally-ill-with-lung-cancer-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Debbie was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer </a>earlier this year.</p>



<p>While there&#8217;s been no official announcement with regard to the cause of death, sources tell <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/03/eminem-mom-debbie-nelson-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> that Debbie succumbed to her illness Monday night.</p>

<p>News of Debbie&#8217;s worsening health first came to us courtesy of a report from <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/eminems-mom-is-terminally-ill-with-advanced-lung-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>.</p>





<p>“There are not many options [for Debbie],&#8221; a source told the outlet in September.</p>



<p>&#8220;She is currently staying between the cancer center and with family members. She has a very limited amount of time [left].”</p>



<p>The insider went on to express concern over whether Em even knew about his mother’s condition.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2164742495-1-1024x675.jpg" alt="Eminem performs before the WBA junior middleweight title bout between Terence Crawford and Israel Madrimov at BMO Stadium on August 3, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>“People around her aren’t even sure if Eminem is even aware of what is happening to his mother,” the source explained.</p>



<p>In addition to Eminem — whose real name is Marshall Mathers — Debbie is survived by another son, Nathan, as well as six grandchildren.</p>



<p>“I’m not ever gonna give up on my kids,” she told <em><a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/interview-eminems-mom-debbie-nelson-on-her-son-marshall-her-new-book-sending-slim-shady-holiday-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Village Voice</a></em> in 2007 while promoting her memoir, <em>My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem</em>.</p>

<p>“There’s hope for everybody. It’s a matter of just basically swallowing your pride. I’m still under doctor’s care, which I probably will be for a while,&#8221; Debbie continued.</p>



<p>“Basically, a lot of the stuff is hereditary, but that happens. Cancers and heart disease and all that, and all the genetic things. I worry about my boys, having high blood pressure and things.”</p>





<p>In the end, Debbie&#8217;s persistence paid off, as she and Em were at least partially reconciled at the time of her death.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-roller-coaster-year">A Roller Coaster Year</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s been an eventful year for the Mathers family.</p>



<p>In May, Eminem&#8217;s eldest daughter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/eminem-daughter-wedding-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailie Jade Mathers, got married</a> to longtime boyfriend Evan McClintock.</p>



<p>And in October, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/eminems-daughter-hailie-jade-mathers-pregnant-with-first-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailie revealed that she&#8217;s pregnant</a> with her first child.</p>



<p>So while 2024 is ending on a tragic note, Eminem and his loved ones still have much to be grateful for.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to the entire Mathers family during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Slim Shady will soon be a grandfather! Yes, Eminem&#8217;s daughter Hailie Jade Mathers is pregnant with her first child.</p>



<p>The hip hop legend shared the news with fans via a touching new music video for his song &#8220;Temporary.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a scene that reminded fans of how far Em has come since his chaotic early days in the spotlight, the bride and her father took to the dance floor for a traditional first dance at her wedding.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for sharing this with us, we know how private you are. this was so special and I feel so honored you shared this with your fans,” a third added.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-mathers-family">The Growing Mathers Family</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s true that Eminem has gone to great lengths to guard his privacy in recent years.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s a far cry from the days when he used to air his dirty laundry in deeply personal songs.)</p>



<p>But his daughter, host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/justalittleshadypodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Just a Little Shady&#8221;</a> podcast, is much more open.</p>



<p>For example, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/eminem-daughter-wedding-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailie and Evan got engaged</a> last year, they were quick to share their joy with fans.</p>

<p>In an interview with Hailie, <a href="https://people.com/eminem-tears-up-as-he-reveals-daughter-hailie-jade-is-pregnant-in-new-music-video-8722849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evan recalled the details</a> of the engagement.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw your dad go downstairs, and I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I gotta do it right now, or I&#8217;m not doing it today, and I&#8217;m gonna have to schedule another time,&#8217; &#8221; he remembered. </p>



<p>&#8220;So I just followed him downstairs, and, thankfully, he was just down there getting your cake and made it happen.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1439397290-1024x683.jpg" alt="Eminem performs onstage during the 37th Annual Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Microsoft Theater on November 05, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Approaching Eminem to ask for permission to propose to his daughter sounds like a frightening experience.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in Evan&#8217;s case, it paid off.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t yet have any details about Hailie&#8217;s due date or how far along she is. But we&#8217;re sure the 28-year-old podcast host will spill the tea on her next episode.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we&#8217;d like to be the latest to offer our sincere congratulations to Hailie, Evan, and the artist soon to be known as Slim Grandpa.</p>

<p>Eminem&#8217;s relationship with his estranged mom has inspired numerous songs and a memorable storyline in the rapper&#8217;s biopic.</p>



<p>Now, it looks as though the situation is coming to a head in tragic fashion.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/eminems-mom-is-terminally-ill-with-advanced-lung-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>, Eminem&#8217;s mother, Debbie Nelson, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2164742495-1024x675.jpg" alt="Eminem performs before the WBA junior middleweight title bout between Terence Crawford and Israel Madrimov at BMO Stadium on August 3, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>And while the music icon continues to provide for his mom financially, the two are reportedly not on speaking terms.</p>



<p>In fact, sources close to the situation say they&#8217;re unsure if Em is even aware of his mother&#8217;s illness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eminem-s-mom-fights-for-her-life">Eminem&#8217;s Mom Fights For Her Life</h2>



<p>A source describes Debbie as “terminally ill with advanced lung cancer&#8221; and notes that her son has not been to St. Joseph, Missouri, to see her.</p>



<p>“There are not many options [for Debbie],” the insider says. </p>

<p>“She is currently staying between the cancer center and with family members. She has a very limited amount of time [left].”</p>



<p>The source goes on to express concern over whether Em even knows about his mother&#8217;s condition.</p>



<p>“People around her aren’t even sure if <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/eminem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eminem</a> is even aware of what is happening to his mother,” the insider adds. </p>



<p>“He’s good to his mom. He makes sure he takes care of her, but they don’t really talk. It would be good for both of them [to communicate]. This could give them the chance to reconcile.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-debbie-s-history-of-health-issues">Debbie&#8217;s History of Health Issues</h2>



<p>In a 2008 interview, Debbie revealed that she was battling breast cancer.</p>



<p>“I’m not ever gonna give up on my kids,” Debbie told <em><a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/interview-eminems-mom-debbie-nelson-on-her-son-marshall-her-new-book-sending-slim-shady-holiday-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Village Voice</a></em> while promoting her memoir, <em>My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem</em>.</p>



<p>“There’s hope for everybody. It’s a matter of just basically swallowing your pride. I’m still under doctor’s care, which I probably will be for a while. </p>



<p>&#8220;Basically, a lot of the stuff is hereditary, but that happens. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-ready-to-return-to-work-following-cancer-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a> and heart disease and all that, and all the genetic things.

<p>These days, Eminem is focused on family like never before.</p>



<p>He recently beamed with pride at daughter <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/eminem-daughter-wedding-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailie&#8217;s wedding</a>. And insiders say the hip hop legend has even made peace with ex-wife <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/kim-scott-eminems-ex-wife-hospitalized-following-suicide-attempt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Scott</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that Eminem and his mother remain estranged. </p>



<p>And they might not have much time left to repair their relationship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Well, we think it&#8217;s safe to say that Hailie Mathers had a weekend to remember!</p>



<p>The daughter of Eminem announced on Monday that she&#8217;s engaged to longtime boyfriend Evan McClintock!</p>



<p>Clearly, Hailie did not inherit her father&#8217;s flair for the dramatic, as she announced the news in a rather off-hand manner:</p>



<p>&#8220;Casual weekend recap…&#8221; the 27-year-old influencer captioned a carousel of proposal pics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;2.4.23 i love you @evanmcclintock11,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Hailey and Evan were instantly flooded with congratulations, but quite a few commenters wondered about Slim Shady&#8217;s opinion of his future son-in-law.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the hip hop icon has not yet commented publicly on his daughter&#8217;s engagement, so we don&#8217;t what his opinion might be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rapper Eminem has gotten in trouble more than a few times. But he&#8217;s chilled in recent years. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But Em has mellowed considerably in middle-age, and he and Hailey have always enjoyed a very close relationship.</p>



<p>So Marshall probably approves of this new development in the life of his beloved daughter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But even though Evan is dealing with a kinder, gentler Eminem than the one we got to know in the &#8217;90s, asking for Pop&#8217;s blessing was probably a pretty daunting task.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of the elder Mathers&#8217; music, then we probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that Hailey is far more famous than most rapper&#8217;s daughters.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s largely because she figured prominently in his lyrics, but it&#8217;s also because she&#8217;s carved a career for herself as a popular influencer with more than 3 million followers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">What else is there to even say about this snapshot? Mathers can be the epitome of cool. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hailey&#8217;s millions of online fans first met Evan around this time last year, when he appeared in Hailey&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day post.</p>



<p>But while he only met the public fairly recently, Evan has reportedly been dating Hailey since way back in 2016.</p>



<p>Despite her massive web presence, Hailey does an impressive job of protecting her privacy, a fact that she acknowledged in June when she shared a second snap of Evan (below).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hailie Jade Mathers is engaged to Evan McClintock! The couple have been dating since 2016! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I rarely share my feed,&#8221; she captioned the photo, &#8220;but when I do, I&#8217;m happy it&#8217;s with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Em may not have addressed Hailie&#8217;s engagement yet, but he speaks often about how proud he is of his eldest daughter.</p>



<p>He most recently gushed with fatherly pride during an interview on Mike Tyson&#8217;s podcast.</p>



<p>Em told the boxing champ how much he&#8217;s in awe of Hailie&#8217;s achievements, particularly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/hailie-mathers-returns-to-instagram-after-6-month-hiatus-posts-s/">her graduation from college with honors</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hailie shares lots of photos of herself just hanging out at a coffee shop, writing as a caption in this case: &#8220;a before i had to go to the dentist mood.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s made me proud for sure,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to keep your kids grounded when they&#8217;re in a situation like I have,&#8221; Em continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;People also think, too, that money just buys happiness—that absolutely is not the truth. You&#8217;ve got to be right inside otherwise none of this s&#8211;t means nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our sincere congrats go out to the entire Mathers and McClintock families on this joyous occasion!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Eminem was part of one of the greatest halftime performances in Super Bowl history on Sunday night.</p>
<p>This statement should not be controversial to anyone who tuned in.</p>
<p>But the legendary rapper <em>did</em> go ahead and stir up some drama at the conclusion of his &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; rendition in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>How so? By doing the following&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yup. Eminem took to a knee after completing his segment of an old school rap-themed show that featured himself, Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg and Mary J. Blige.</p>
<p>The artist wasn&#8217;t performing.</p>
<p>He was almost definitely paying homage to&nbsp;Colin Kaepernick.</p>
<p>The former NFL quarterback kneeled uring the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality and social injustice throughout the country.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Other players eventually followed suit, and the move created widespread cultural chatter and controversial.</p>
<p>The former San Francisco signal-caller has been out of football since the year he made this move&#8230; with anyone whose head is above sand aware that he was blackballed by owners as a result of his gesture.</p>
<p>Eminem, for his part, has a history of supporting Kaepernick&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>In 2017, during the BET Hip Hop Awards, he performed a four-plus minute freestyle rap, calling out former President Donald Trump in the process and embracing Kaepernick and his message on racism and police brutality at another point.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Detroit rapper raised his fist at that time and rapped:</p>
<p>&quot;F-ck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that sh-t balled like Donald the bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>According to reports, meanwhile, officials from the NFL had seen Eminem and his friends rehearse for the Super Bowl halftime show and noted that he had taken a knee during these run-ups to Sunday as well.</p>
<p>The league had allegedly told Eminem NOT to honor&nbsp;Kaepernick in such a manner.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We watched all elements of the show during multiple rehearsals this week and were aware that Eminem was going to do that,&#8221; league spokesman Brian McCarthy simply told ESPN in response after the concert aired.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Eminem also included Kaepernick in the lyrics of his 2017 song &quot;Untouchable,&quot; which included these lyrics:</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb &#8230; So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum &#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#8217;t stand for the national anthem &#8230; We raise it, you better praise it.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This Super Bowl performance marked the first time hip-hop artists were the main performers at halftime of the big game, which the Los Angeles Rams won by a score of 23-20 over the Cincinnati&nbsp;Bengals.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of his planned kneeling, Eminem confessed late last week that he was anxious to be part of history.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;mma tell you, it&#8217;s f-cking nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s f-cking nerve-wracking,&quot; the rapper said on SiriusXM&#8217;s Sway in the Morning. &quot;This to me&hellip; there&#8217;s nothing more final than live TV. So, if you f-ck up, your f-ck up is there forever.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>If you ask this <a href="/">celebrity gossip</a> website, however?</p>
<p>Eminem did not f-ck up at the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Longtime Eminem fans will no doubt be familiar with the rapper&#8217;s ex-wife, Kim Scott, who has often been mentioned in his music, usually in less than complimentary terms.</p>
<p>In recent years, Em and Kim have worked through many of their issues and managed to form a civil co-parenting relationship.</p>
<p>Both parties struggled with substance abuse and endured numerous brushes with the law during their time together, but their situations seemed to have stabilized in recent years.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears that Scott&#8217;s mental health issues took a turn for the worse and very nearly claimed her life last week.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/11/eminem-ex-wife-kim-scott-suicide-attempt-hospitalized/">new report</a> from TMZ, Kim has been hospitalized after attempting to take her own life.</p>
<p>Few details of her suicide attempt are available at this time, but it seems that Kim was fully conscious when paramedics arrived at her home in response to a 911 call.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on who placed the call, but it appears that it was not Kim.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In fact, police reports indicate that she became combative with the first responders who showed up at her door.</p>
<p>Kim reportedly needed to be restrained by deputies who also arrived at the scene, and she was so resistant to receiving care that paramedics were unable to check her vitals.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if there were any further injuries, paramedics reports that Kim appeared to have suffered minor lacerations on the back of her leg.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>TMZ reports that &quot;a good amount of blood was on the floor&quot; of her home.</p>
<p>She was eventually taken to a hospital where she received full physical and psychiatric evaluations</p>
<p>Kim has since been released and is currently resting at home.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on whether she is receiving additional treatment, and no one in her inner circle has commented on the situation publicly.</p>
<p>Kim and Eminem &#8212; real name Marshall Mathers &#8212; married in 1999 and divorced in 2001.</p>
<p>They got remarried in 2006, but the second attempt lasted only a matter of months.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The couple had one child together, Hailie Mathers, who recently graduated from Michigan State University.</p>
<p>For years, Eminem lashed out at his ex with vicious and frequently violent lyrics.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, his tone changed, as he and his ex were able to set aside their differences for the sake of Hailie, as well as Whitney and Alaina Mathers, who Em adopted when their mother, Kim&#8217;s sister, proved unable to care for them due to substance abuse issues.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>These days, when Marshall mentions Kim in a verse, he does so in a much kinder fashion.</p>
<p>In the 2010 song Going Through Changes, he rapped:</p>
<p>&quot;I still love your mother, that&rsquo;ll never change, think about her every day / We just could never get it together hey, wish there was a better way&quot;.</p>

<p>In a 2017 track titled &quot;Bad Husband,&quot; he offered up the following apology:</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry, Kim, more than you could ever comprehend / Leaving you was fucking harder than sawing off a f&#8211;king body limb&quot;.</p>
<p>We wish Kim and her loved ones all the best during this difficult time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When Eminem&#8217;s pseudo-biopic 8 Mile hit theaters in 2002, it was an instant hit with critics and audiences, and the film&#8217;s soundtrack became one of the year&#8217;s bestselling albums.</p>
<p>Of course, Billie Eilish wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this, as she was just 11 months old at the time.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why Billie was one of the stars who seemed less than blown away by Em&#8217;s surprise performance of the 8 Mile hit &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; at the <a href="/2020/02/2020-oscar-winners-who-got-totally-robbed/">2020 Academy Awards</a> on Sunday night.</p>
<p>You may have seen the above .GIF of an unenthused Eilish reacting to the rapper&#8217;s rousing rendition of his signature song.</p>
<p>To be clear, no one really knows how Billie felt about the performance, as she hasn&#8217;t offered any commentary on it <em>or</em> her viral moment.</p>
<p>And that wasn&#8217;t Billie&#8217;s only meme-worthy reaction shot of the night.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Here she is reacting to a Kristen Wiig-Maya Rudolph comedy segment that fell a bit flat.</p>
<p>This one also went semi-viral, and lots of folks seem to be under the impression that it was also a reaction to Em&#8217;s performance, but that&#8217;s what the kids these days call &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, Billie wasn&#8217;t the only star who seemed less than blown-away by Mr. Mathers&#8217; performance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Yup, there&#8217;s the legendary Martin Scorsese.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was just tired. More than likely, he was thinking about how he would probably rather be just about anywhere else in the world than front-and-center at the Dolby Theater.</p>
<p>Of course, both at home and in the crowd, many audience members were ecstatic to see Em &#8211; who famously skipped the Academy Awards the year this song was released &#8211; take the stage.</p>

<p>In fact, in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/what-was-your-favorite-oscars-2020-performances-vote-1278474?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;__twitter_impression=true">a poll</a> conducted by The Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; was ranked as the best-loved performance of the night, even edging out Janelle Monae&#8217;s high-energy opening number.</p>
<p>So what gives?</p>
<p>Why were some celebs so obviously bored, while others &#8211; like Zazie Beetz below &#8211; absolutely smitten by the throwback jam.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Well, it probably had little to do with the song itself, and much to do with Sunday night&#8217;s messy, marathon Oscars telecast.</p>
<p>It was the lowest-rated broadcast in the awards&#8217; 92-year history,</p>
<p>At just over three and a half hours, the ceremony achieved the dubious feat of lasting longer than the runtime of The Irishman.</p>
<p>Critics felt the decision to go host-less for the second year in a row was a mistake, and the evening was marred by a number of glitches.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kobe Bryant (above) was honored, but the&nbsp;<a href="/2020/02/luke-perry-left-out-of-oscars-in-memoriam-segment-fans-react-wit/">&quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment left out Luke Perry</a> and several other beloved stars.</p>
<p>And the singer for that segment?</p>
<p>You guessed it: Billie Eilish.</p>
<p>Maybe she was just grimacing at the thought of what she would be asked to do later &#8230;</p>

<p>Fans have grown accustomed to this approach, and like other holdovers from the early 2000s such as Family Guy and South Park, the rapper has often been given a pass in situations where other artists would be forced to publicly apologize.</p>

<p>But even some of Em&#8217;s most ardent defenders might find themselves cringing at a lyric the rapper recorded back in 2009 and wisely decided <em>not</em> to release.</p>
<p>As E! reports, the offensive line unexpectedly appeared in a Reddit post entitled&nbsp;&quot;(SNIPPET) Eminem &#8211; Things Get Worse (Rihanna Diss).&quot;</p>
<p>Published on the site on Monday afternoon, the post contains a 7-second audio clip, in which Eminem &#8212; whose real name is Marshall Mathers &#8212; can be heard rapping the following line:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;d side with Chris Brown, I&#8217;d beat down a b-tch too.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="775" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-775x1024.jpg" alt="Rihanna in Pink" class="wp-image-297578" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-775x1024.jpg 775w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-227x300.jpg 227w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-768x1014.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-1163x1536.jpg 1163w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-735x971.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-254x335.jpg 254w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-263x347.jpg 263w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-394x520.jpg 394w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-485x640.jpg 485w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-581x768.jpg 581w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-727x960.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink-818x1080.jpg 818w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/rihanna-in-pink.jpg 1396w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Not much room for interpretation there.</p>
<p>The lyric clearly refers to the shameful 2009 incident in which <a href="/2017/08/chris-brown-details-abusive-relationship-with-rihanna-she-hates/">Brown brutally beat Rihanna</a>, leaving the singer hospitalized.</p>
<p>The snippet seems to be from the recording sessions leading up to the release of Mathers&#8217; 2009 album Relapse.</p>
<p>A different version of the verse that wound up on &quot;Things Get Worse,&quot; a collaboration with rapper B.O.B.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear who decided to shelve the lyric, but fortunately, the decision was made to replace the line with something less offensive before the song&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>The lyrics are particularly shocking in light of the fact that Mathers and Rihanna are longtime professional associates who have collaborated on a number of songs.</p>
<p>This fact was not lost on the many irate music fans who commented on the situation on social media.</p>
<p>&quot;Eminem grown ass really glorifying abuse for a damn song after my fav lend her vocals to numerous songs for him is disgusting,&quot; one fan tweeted.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The line was recorded before Em and Rihanna collaborated on such hit singles as &quot;Love the Way You Lie&quot; and &quot;The Monster.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with &quot;2009 was a different time&quot; and &quot;someone (possibly Eminem) made the decision not to release the line&quot; that fact is being cited by Eminem apologists eager to absolve the rapper of any blame.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that Brown&#8217;s savage assault was on Rihanna was one of the most appalling celebrity stories of the past decade, and its place on the list of Things You Just Don&#8217;t Joke About is carved in stone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same can be said for all instances of domestic abuse, regardless of whether or not the victims or perpetrators are famous.</p>
<p>Neither Eminem nor Rihanna has commented on the leak publicly, but unless the audio turns out to be fraudulent, it&#8217;s clear that the rapper owes his frequent collaborator an apology &#8212; and a large donation to a battered woman&#8217;s shelter in her name would be a good place to start.</p>

Nick is nursing an 11-year-old grudge.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been feuding with Eminem since 2008, when the infamous rapper took cheap shots at Nick&#8217;s then-wife, Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>More than a decade later, Nick is making it clear that he still feels that Eminem needs to be held accountable for what he said.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Speaking on T.I.&#8217;s podcast <em>ExpediTIously</em>, Nick Cannon opens up about his longstanding resentment towards Eminem.</p>
<p>He clearly doesn&#8217;t like that the rapper never met up with him to settle things.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t wanna battle me,&#8221; Nick observes.</p>
<p>He says that: &#8220;it could have went down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like, whatever he wanna do, I&#8217;m with it,&#8221; Nick shares.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The feud began in 2008, shortly after Nick and Mariah had first married.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we were flying back on a jet from Africa or somewhere,&#8221; Nick recalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this motherf&#8211;ker drops a song, like, talking s&#8211;t,&#8221; he complains.</p>
<p>Within that song, Nick accuses, Eminem was &#8220;Calling her [Mariah] all kinds of b&#8211;ches and hoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s enough to upset anyone, but especially her husband.</p>

<p>Nick recalls his furious response: &#8220;I’m like, &#8216;this is my wife. This is my new wife.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote a letter first,&#8221; he reveals.</p>
<p>A <em>letter</em>? We suppose that the telegram lines were down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t even know if Twitter had come out yet,&#8221; Nixk admits.</p>
<p>Twitter came out in 2008, but existing and being popular are not the same thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I wrote this long-ass letter,&#8221; Nick relates.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Within the letter, the content was &#8220;pretty much saying, &#8216;look, I respect you as an artist.'&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great way to get off on the right foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I’m actually a fan,&#8221; Nick admitted within the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he told Eminem at the time. &#8220;I think you’re one of the best ever to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But from man to man,&#8221; Nick wrote. &#8220;You are talking out of pocket to my wife.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;You gotta be held accountable for that,&#8221; Nick expresses.</p>
<p>Goodness. If this were ye olden times, Nick would have had to strike Eminem across the face with a fancy glove to challenge him to a duel.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Nick recalls telling him. &#8220;I need to see you face-to-face.'&#8221;</p>
<p>He even says that he &#8220;went looking for&#8221; Eminem. Again, this is some straight-up feudal era knights-of-honor nonsense.</p>
<p>Nick even says that he would have flown to Detroit for this confrontation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was like, look, if you wanna get on the phone, if I gotta go to Detroit,&#8221; Nick recalls.</p>
<p>This guy was <em>big mad</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You done disrespected my wife,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Nick explains his extreme fixation: &#8220;I gotta show my wife I&#8217;m a man, number one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toxic masculinity ruins the party once again, we see.</p>

<p>&#8220;And two, he said my name,&#8221; Nick notes.</p>
<p>Which summons him instantly. Like Beetlejuice.</p>
<p>Nick concludes: &#8220;I said, &#8216;I know I&#8217;m not going to be able to out rap you, but I will whoop your ass.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;ll say this much for Nick Cannon:</p>
<p>He has a very grounded and realistic estimation of his abilities.</p>
<p>It sounds like Eminem does, too, which is probably why he never went face-to-face with Nick to square things away.</p>

<p>Radar Online <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/08/eminem-adopted-daughter-biological-father-dies-suspected-overdose-drug-charges-release-jail/">is reporting </a>that the troubled biological father of Whitney Scott Mathers &#8212; whom the rapper has raised for most of her life &#8212; passed away unexpectedly this week.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Eric Hartter was just 40 years old.</p>
<p>“A call was made by a family member who came by to check the location, and found the victim unresponsive with no signs of trauma,” said a spokesperson for the Detroit Police Department in a statement about Hartter&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>“A medic pronounced him DOA on scene.”</p>
<p>This is the second time that Hartter&#8217;s name has appeared in tabloid headlines in recent weeks.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In July, <a href="/2019/07/eminem-father-of-rappers-adopted-daughter-sentenced-to-prison/">Hartter was tried on drug possession charges</a> while already serving time for petty theft.</p>
<p>He was released on schedule, but was ordered to attend an addiction treatment program.</p>
<p>It is unknown if Hartter&#8217;s substance abuse issues played a role in his untimely passing.</p>
<p>Police say an autopsy has been scheduled, and results of a toxicology report will be released before the year is out.</p>

<p>Even casual fans of Eminem &#8212; real name Marshall Mathers &#8212; are familiar with the intense domestic drama that&#8217;s defined much of the rapper&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>But they may not be aware of his ties to Hartter, who fathered a child with Mathers&#8217; ex-wife, Kim.</p>
<p>Marshall and Kim weren&#8217;t married for long, but their relationship had an indelible impact on the iconic emcee&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Not only did the former couple have a daughter together, Mathers later adopted Kim&#8217;s niece, Alaina, as well as her daughter Whitney from her relationship with Hartter.</p>

<p>As one of the wealthiest recording artists on the planet, Em was able to provide a better life for Kim&#8217;s niece and daughter.</p>
<p>But he was not able to insulate them entirely from the challenges presented by their unstable families.</p>
<p>Though Whitney Mathers did not have a close relationship with her father, insiders say she and Hartter were still in contact at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Hartter&#8217;s passing caps off a tumultuous few months for Marshall, whose father,<a href="/2019/06/marshall-bruce-mathers-dies-father-of-eminem-was-67/"> Bruce Mathers, passed away</a> in June.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to Eminem and his family at this difficult time.</p>
