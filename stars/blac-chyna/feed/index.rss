										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>According to multiple new reports, Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna have reconciled.</p>



<p>In a legal sense of this word and term.</p>



<p>E! News, Us Weekly and other outlets confirmed on Monday that the exes &#8212; who shares custody of a daughter named Dream &#8212; have settled their revenge porn lawsuit outside of court, just hours before jury selection on the trial was scheduled to begin.</p>



<p>Michael Rhodes, an attorney for Kardashian, subsequently confirmed the news.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Just this past Thursday, a judge from the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles County <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/blac-chyna-victory-judge-denies-rob-kardashian-lawsuit-motion/">denied Kardashian&#8217;s previous motion</a> to enforce a settlement over Chyna&#8217;s allegations.</p>



<p>It seemed at that time as if the trial would, indeed, move forward.</p>



<p>&#8220;Chyna is very pleased that the trial judge denied Rob&#8217;s motion to &#8216;enforce&#8217; a settlement that never existed,&#8221; Chyna&#8217;s attorney said afterwarrd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Without a settlement, Chyna will prove her case to a Los Angeles jury on June 20 that Rob posted devastating revenge porn of her to millions of his Instagram followers without her consent.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Blac Chyna filed her lawsuit way back in October 2017, about three months after she and her one-time fiance went their separate ways.</p>



<p>At the time, she accused Kardashian of using his social media to leak sexually graphic images of her without her consent.</p>



<p>There was even talk about four years ago that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/07/rob-kardashian-will-he-face-revenge-porn-charges/">Rob might face criminal charges</a> for this irresponsible and inappropriate act.</p>



<p>From Chyna&#8217;s point of view, she filed this lawsuit because she alleged Kardashian&#8217;s damaged her reputation via the X-rated leak; she also accused Rob of emotionally and physically abusing her.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Kardashian fired back his ex-lover&#8217;s claims in an April court filing. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Kardashian denies Ms. White’s allegation that he posted the images without Ms. White’s consent and denies that Ms. White had an expectation of privacy in the images,&#8221; lawyers for the reality star wrote in the documents. </p>



<p>&#8220;He also disputes that his conduct caused Ms. White to sustain any mental pain and suffering, humiliation or emotional distress.</p>



<p>&#8220;And contends that Ms. White is not entitled to recover monetary damages.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/kardashians-defeat-blac-chyna-in-court-win-defamation-lawsuit-ag/">Chyna lost a separate defamation lawsuit</a> against Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner.</p>



<p>The terms of her settlement with Rob on Monday have not yet been disclosed.</p>



<p>Blac Chyna&#8217;s attorney emphasized last week, however, just how serious she viewed the decision by Kardashian in 2017 to leak the aforementioned photos of his daughter&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Revenge porn is a very dangerous form of violence predominantly perpetrated against girls and women,&#8221; said Lynne Ciani.</p>



<p>&#8220;Victims of revenge porn typically experience serious anxiety, shame, and helplessness. Some revenge porn victims have committed suicide. </p>



<p>&#8220;Rob Kardashian has never taken responsibility for his heinous and vengeful act of posting revenge porn against Chyna in July 2017. </p>



<p>&#8220;He was never criminally prosecuted. It is finally time for Rob to be held accountable in a court of law.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that this settlement does not end Chyna&#8217;s legal entanglement with the Kardashians.</p>



<p>In the wake of a judge dismissing her defamation lawsuit against her near-in-laws several weeks ago, the Kardashians are seeking a total of $391,094.76 from Chyna in legal fees.</p>



<p>According to paperwork this family filed, the Kardashians listed the cost for &#8220;models, enlargements and photocopies of exhibits&#8221; as a large expense &#8212; at a total of more than $184,000. </p>



<p>The documents also referenced deposition costs of $63,000 and court reporter fees in the amount of nearly $20,000.</p>

<p>In an earlier court filing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/rob-kardashian-accuses-blac-chyna-of-breaking-agreement-asks-cou/">Rob Kardashian accused Blac Chyna of breaking</a> a previous agreement.</p>



<p>Had they both kept up their ends of an alleged out-of-court deal, they <em>both </em>might have been spared some hardship.</p>



<p>Of course, Chyna says that the alleged agreement as Rob described it did not exist.</p>



<p>The court has declined Rob&#8217;s request to force her to go with the deal. This isn&#8217;t over.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>On Thursday, June 16, a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles turned down Rob Kardashian&#8217;s motion.</p>



<p>He had asked the court to enforce an alleged settlement with Blac Chyna, his ex.</p>



<p>Chyna and her team deny that the agreement ever existed in the first place, and are now in a celebratory mood.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Blac Chyna shared her look in this wig and these cosmetics. Unfortunately, she&#8217;s recently come under scrutiny after a disturbing video appeared to show her brawling at an amusement park.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Her attorney, Lynne Ciani, spoke to <em><a href="https://people.com/tv/rob-kardashian-and-blac-chyna-fail-to-reach-settlement-on-revenge-porn-claims-exes-will-go-to-trial/">People</a></em> about this latest development.</p>



<p>&#8220;Chyna is very pleased that the trial judge denied Rob&#8217;s motion to &#8216;enforce&#8217; a settlement that never existed,&#8221; she stated.</p>



<p>&#8220;Without a settlement,&#8221; Ciani continued, &#8220;Chyna will prove her case to a Los Angeles jury on June 20.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Rob Kardashian shared his thoughts during and after his relationship with Blac Chyna. With disastrous results.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chyna intends to make her case &#8220;that Rob posted devastating revenge porn of her.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2017, Rob posted all of this &#8220;to millions of his Instagram followers without her consent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those of us who were following Rob in early July five years ago remember that incident all too well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Why was Blac Chyna invited to the Oscars? We have no idea. But she looked great on the red carpet, huh?</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Revenge porn is a very dangerous form of violence,&#8221; Ciani detailed.</p>



<p>Revenge porn, she added, is &#8220;predominantly perpetrated against girls and women.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Victims of revenge porn typically experience serious anxiety, shame, and helplessness,&#8221; Ciani expressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Many revenge porn victims also see their employment suffer as a result. It&#8217;s horrific.</p>



<p>Grimly, she cited: &#8220;Some revenge porn victims have committed suicide.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whatever people may think of Chyna as a person, we can all be glad that she was not also a suicide victim.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Blac Chyna looks as lovely as ever in this photo, but &#8230; some fans can&#8217;t help but wonder if she chose this pose because it might conceal a baby bump.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Rob Kardashian has never taken responsibility,&#8221; Ciani stated.</p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;for his heinous and vengeful act of posting revenge porn against Chyna in July 2017.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ciani added: &#8220;He was never criminally prosecuted.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Rob Kardashian holds daughter Dream in this picture. He does seem to be a doting father, doesn&#8217;t he?</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;It is finally time for Rob to be held accountable in a court of law,&#8221; Ciani concluded.</p>



<p>While revenge porn is illegal in many places, that does not mean that perpetrators are held accountable.</p>



<p>Justice is a complicated thing, and our legal system is ill-equipped to dispense it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Blac Chyna has gone blue. What do you think of the model&#8217;s unusual hair color, folks?</figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the alleged deal, Rob claimed that Chyna had offered to drop her lawsuit against him.</p>



<p>There was one condition, however:</p>



<p>Rob had to get Chyna out of a separate lawsuit with no further expenditures on her part.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Pilot Jones accused Rob and Chyna of outing him as gay.</p>



<p>After his outing, Pilot became the target of cruel social media harassment campaign.</p>



<p>Rob claimed that Chyna changed her mind and acted in bad faith, while she says that there was no deal to begin with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Back in April, Blac Chyna&#8217;s $100 million defamation lawsuit against the Kardashians finally went to court.</p>



<p>And it didn&#8217;t take long for the jury to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/kardashians-defeat-blac-chyna-in-court-win-defamation-lawsuit-ag/">find in the Kardashians&#8217; favor</a>.</p>



<p>The irony is that Chyna was accusing the Kards of destroying her reputation, but the suit itself resulted in what might have been the greatest public humiliation of her career.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>One of the most shocking moments of the trial came when Kris Jenner revealed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/kris-jenner-testifies-i-really-thought-blac-chyna-was-gonna-kill/">she feared for Rob Kardashian&#8217;s life</a> during his relationship with Blac.</p>



<p>Stories about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">Chyna pulling a gun on Rob</a> and striking him with blunt objects convinced the jury that she was not the helpless victim she made herself out to be.</p>



<p>Now, the Kardashians are requesting reimbursement for the $390,000 they spent on legal fees.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>And a lawyer for Chyna (whose real name is Angela White) is accusing the family of trying to bankrupt her client.</p>



<p>(Ed. note: We don&#8217;t recommend googling Chyna&#8217;s birth name if you&#8217;re at work, as it appears there&#8217;s a popular adult entertainer who goes by that moniker. Excuse us as we clear our search history!)</p>



<p>“Kris Jenner’s attempt to financially ruin Angela White, the mother of her granddaughter Dream Kardashian, will not work,” attorney Lynne Ciani said in a statement issued this week.</p>



<p>Ciani noted that defendants are entitled to such compensation only when a jury determines that “they are without fault.”</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But the jury in Chyna vs. the Kardashians found that Kris and Kylie Jenner both “falsely claimed” that Chyna had abused Rob during their relationship.</p>



<p>“The same Los Angeles jury reached a verdict that defendants Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner did not act reasonably and in good faith to protect their own economic interests in the ‘Rob &amp; Chyna’ show,” Ciani continued.</p>



<p>Yes, one of Blac&#8217;s claims against the Kardashians was that Kim and company had done her financial harm by sabotaging the reality show in which she co-starred with Rob.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The jury apparently found that she her claim was partially true:</p>



<p>The Kardashians had failed to promote the project, even though it starred one of their own.</p>



<p><em>Rob &amp; Chyna</em> is not the first Kardashian spinoff to fail in its first season (remember <em>Life of Kylie</em>?), but the Kards usually do everything that they can to boost their projects.</p>

<p>And it seems the jury found that they failed to do so in the case of <em>Rob &amp; Chyna</em>.</p>



<p>So while Blac may have lost her lawsuit against the Kardashians, she probably won&#8217;t be forced to pay their legal fees.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a minor victory for Chyna, but one that&#8217;ll save her quite a chunk of change.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The Kardashians are probably hoping that that will be their last legal battle against Chyna.</p>



<p>But she and Rob have still have a daughter together, and something tells us that their custody and child support agreements will require frequent retooling in the years to come.</p>



<p>So the Kardashians might want to do their best to remain on Chyna&#8217;s good side &#8212; otherwise, they&#8217;re sure to wind up back in court in the very near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last month, the Kardashian family won their <a href="/2022/05/kardashians-defeat-blac-chyna-in-court-win-defamation-lawsuit-ag/">defamation suit against Blac Chyna</a>.</p>
<p>This was a complicated case, involving multiple Kardashians and Jenners, their short-lived E! deal, and of course precious little Dream.</p>
<p>Rob and Chyna allegedly reached a deal with each other over their years-long revenge porn suit.</p>
<p>Now, Rob accuses Chyna of backing out of the deal, and Chyna&#8217;s attorney is accusing Rob of a new crime.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rob Kardashian is currently asking a judge to make Blac Chyna stick to a deal that the two allegedly made.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/06/06/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-revenge-porn-settlement/"><em>TMZ</em></a> reports that Rob filed documents on Monday.</p>
<p>Per his attorneys, Chyna agreed to drop a lawsuit against him over that awful revenge porn incident &#8230; on one condition.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The condition was, according to the documents, that Rob must help to get Chyna dropped from a separate lawsuit.</p>
<p>Remember all of <a href="/2022/02/rob-kardashian-spews-racist-homophobic-slurs-threatens-pilot-jon/">that ugly business with Pilot Jones</a>, who &#8212; among ohter things &#8212; accuses the erstwhile couple of outing him as gay?</p>
<p>Rob says that he had agreed to work to get Chyna dropped from the suit.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rob was supposed to get Chyna out of that legal quagmire without any further cost to her.</p>
<p>He says that she had agreed to drop the revenge porn case in return.</p>
<p>According to Rob&#8217;s filing, he accepted the deal, but Chyna is now threatening to move forward on the revenge porn case, taking it to trial.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Obviously, this is precisely what Rob and his legal team were trying to avoid in the first place.</p>
<p>Rob wants her to formally drop the case.</p>
<p>He is asking the court to enforce the contract that the exes struck with one another.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Blac Chyna&#8217;s attorney, Lynne Ciani, responded to the case and spoke to <em>TMZ</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Under California law, settlement discussions are confidential,&quot; Ciani asserted.</p>
<p>She claimed that &quot;Rob Kardashian has violated California law by revealing alleged details of ongoing settlement discussions.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Chyna is permitted under California law to disclose that settlement discussions regarding her revenge porn case against her ex-fiance are ongoing,&quot; Ciani noted.</p>
<p>&quot;When and if a confidential settlement is reached on this case,&quot; she noted, &quot;Chyna will alert the court first and then the media.&quot;</p>
<p>Ciani continued: &quot;Regarding the earlier trial in April 2022, a Los Angeles jury soundly rejected Rob&rsquo;s testimony that Chyna had physically abused him.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ciani then asserted: &quot;The jury found that Chyna, in fact, had not physically abused Rob.&quot;</p>
<p>That is a significant and divisive topic, but neither here nor there when it comes to the court case at hand.</p>
<p>It is unclear if Rob&#8217;s mentioning the deal in a court filing actually broke any state laws.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As it stands, the revenge porn trial is scheduled to begin next week.</p>
<p>The court may hold an emergency hearing in order to address Rob&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>Perhaps Chyna&#8217;s own filing will shed light on why she is allegedly breaking a deal.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rob and Chyna&#8217;s relationship was full of contention and conflict, and the years since they broke up have not been any different.</p>
<p>This is an ugly case, and we hope that it can all be resolved soon.</p>
<p>However, we hope that it&#8217;s resolved justly. We all know that disagreements, both in and out of court, are sometimes settled wrongly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The verdict is in.</p>
<p>And the Kardashians aren&#8217;t out any money as a result.</p>
<p>Just over a week after Blac Chyna&#8217;s defamation case against the Kardashian-Jenner family kicked off in court, a jury has unanimously sided with Kim, Kris and company.</p>
<p>On May 2, these 12 men and women awarded <em>no</em> damages to Chyna, who previously accused Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kris Jenner of defamation and contract interference.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The just-completed trial came five years after Chyna split from Rob Kardashian, to whom she was once engaged and with whom she shares a daughter.</p>
<p>Shortly after the stars broke up, Chyna filed a lawsuit that claimed Rob and his sister defamed her via a number of negative social media posts&#8230; while also claiming they conspired with E! executives to cancel her and Rob&#8217;s reality show after just one season.</p>
<p>On Friday,&nbsp;a judge had issued a directed verdict to find Kim <strong><em>not</em></strong> liable with respect to defamation, ruling that there is &quot;no evidence&quot; that Kardashian took a &quot;responsible part&quot; in publishing any alleged defamatory statements.</p>
<p>The claim against her for alleged interference with a contract then went to the jury.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday, meanwhile, a jury sided with the Kardashians across the board, awarding Chyna no monetary damages in the wake of her allegations.&#8217;</p>
<p>During the Los Angeles court proceedings, Rob, Kylie, Kim, Khloe and Kris all took the stand to testify.</p>
<p>In Rob&#8217;s testimony on April 27, he stated that his relationship with Chyna &quot;was all negative&quot; and that he was at his &quot;weakest&quot; when their romance began.</p>
<p>He also detailed alleged assaults against him, saying that <a href="/2022/04/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-beat-me-with-a-metal-rod-pulled-a-gun/">Chyna beat him with a metal rod</a> in 2016 and also pulled a gun on him.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I was probably in the worst place in my entire life,&quot; Rob said on the witness stand, noting he was diagnosed with ketoacidosis and diabetes at that time. &quot;She was catching me at my lowest.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of her own testimony, Chyna did not deny the gun incident.</p>
<p>She simply said it was <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">meant as a some kind of cruel joke</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Following Rob and Chyna&#8217;s 2017 split, <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-breaks-down-in-court-bawls-over-nude-photo-leak/">Kardashian leaked nude photos</a> of his ex.</p>
<p>He also hurled a series of allegations against her on Instagram, including claiming she&#8217;s guilty of substance abuse.</p>
<p>The actions resulted in Rob being banned from the platform.</p>
<p>In early April, before the trial got underway, Chyna touched on her intentions behind the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&quot;When they got my No. 1 hit show killed back in January 2017, that not only hurt me financially and emotionally, that hurt my beautiful KIDS,&quot; she wrote on Twitter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In response to the verdict, the Kardashian-Jenner family&#8217;s lawyer, Michael G. Rhodes, said he had just spoken to his clients and &quot;they&#8217;re happy to have this behind them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the case was very clear. The jury did a great job, they got it. The family was very pleased and grateful, they were exuberant,&quot; Rhodes added.</p>
<p>For her part, Blac Chyna plans to appeal.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&rdquo;Two things. Number one, the jury found that Chyna had not physically abused Rob Kardashian,&rdquo; attorney Lynne Ciani told Page Six and other reporters outside of the courthouse shortly after the verdict was announced.</p>
<p>She added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number two, the jury found that all four defendants intentionally interfered with [Chyna&rsquo;s] contracts with the E! Network.</p>
<p>&quot;We will appeal the remainder of the verdict.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Well, <a href="/2022/04/johnny-depp-amber-heard-cut-off-my-finger-punched-me-stubbed-out/">Johnny Depp and Amber Heard</a> aren&#8217;t the only ones leveling shocking allegations at each other on the stand this week.</p>
<p>Three thousand miles from the Virginia courtroom where that drama is unfolding, Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are also making criminal accusations in a civil trial.</p>
<p>And as with the Johnny and Amber situation, this notoriously awful relationship is being exposed as even worse than the public previously thought.</p>
<p><a href="/2022/04/kylie-jenner-blac-chyna-threatened-to-kill-me/">Chyna is suing the Kardashian family for defamation</a>, and Rob took the stand on Wednesday to offer an insider&#8217;s view of their tempestuous relationship.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>She&#8217;s asking for $100 million, alleging that the Kards sabotaged her reality show with Rob and took other actions that hurt her career.</p>
<p>But during yesterday&#8217;s testimony, Rob did further damage to Chyna&#8217;s reputation, alleging that his ex beat him with a metal rod and held a gun to his head on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#8217;t real love. I had a baby with this girl,&quot; Rob told the court.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I had a gun held to my head several times by this woman. That&#8217;s not love,&quot; he added.</p>
<p><a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">Chyna says she was just joking</a> when she pointed a gun at Rob, and when asked to describe the incidents, Rob conceded that at first, he thought she was merely messing around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ripped my shirt early in the evening and we were throwing money around in our Snapchat,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning I thought it was playful. I didn&rsquo;t think it got serious until the second gun encounter &hellip; you don&rsquo;t point a gun on your fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s head whether you think it&rsquo;s loaded or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From there, Rob described an incident in which Chyna allegedly struck him several times with a metal rod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She landed several blows on my body (with the metal rod) &hellip; but not everyone is going to bruise just because someone hit you,&quot; he explained.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;It didn&rsquo;t leave a mark when I had a gun to my temple. The cord around my neck, I&rsquo;m sure that left a mark, but no, I didn&rsquo;t need a band aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything I testified to happened,&rdquo; Rob continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was on a cocaine and alcohol. She has a history of doing this. Just because I didn&rsquo;t have marks doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not true. Stop putting that out there! It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/04/27/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-kardashian-trial-gun-head-kill-love/">According to</a> TMZ, Rob lashed out when Chyna&#8217;s lawyer questioned the veracity of his claims.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop trying to make it sound like it didn&#8217;t happen &#8230; There were no marks on my face or neck. That doesn&#8217;t mean it didn&#8217;t happen,&quot; he angrily told the opposing counsel.</p>
<p>Rob went on to state that much of what he did during his time with Chyna was for the benefit of her career, including going out and about in LA so that the two of them could be photographed together.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t like to leave the house, it upsets me. I&#8217;m insecure about my body. I&#8217;ve gained some weight. I don&#8217;t like going out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked why he stayed with Chyna for so long when he seemed to gain nothing from their relationship, Rob explained that she came to him at a time when his self-esteem was at its lowest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was probably at the worst place in my life &hellip; She was the one person who brought me in,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just comfortable with her&hellip; and I was at my loneliest point. I ignored all the bad things. I have a very loving family but I just gave myself to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chyna previously discussed the gun incident during her own testimony, telling the court that the gesture was intended as a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not loaded,&rdquo; she testified.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Corey Gamble took the stand on Tuesday, laying out his version of events that transpired between Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian back on December 15, 2016.</p>
<p>The long-time boyfriend of Kris Jenner, Gamble was sworn in as a witness in Chyna&#8217;s ongoing defamation lawsuit against her former fiance and his family members, having accused the Kardashians in this legal paperwork of disparaging her to such an extent years ago that they cost her $100 million in earnings.</p>
<p>Specifically, Chyna points to social media posts Rob shared after the couple split up, most notably a series of <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-breaks-down-in-court-bawls-over-nude-photo-leak/">explicit nude photos he leaked of his ex</a>.</p>
<p>Chyna also claims that Kris and her daughters pressured E! to cancel her and Rob&#8217;s reality show after just one season.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Called to testify by the defense on Tuesday inside of a Los Angeles courthouse, Gamble told jurors that he was awoken in the middle of the aforementioned night by a call from Rob to Kris.</p>
<p>&quot;F-ck you, I&#8217;m a kill you fat motherf-cker,&quot; Gamble says he heard Chyna screaming in the background.</p>
<p>Because Rob and Chyna were staying at Kylie Jenner&#8217;s house at the time&#8230; and because it was just a few blocks away and Corey sensed Rob was in major trouble&#8230; Gamble said he raced over in his car to assist.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="540" height="436" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/corey-gamble-image.jpg" alt="Corey Gamble Image" class="wp-image-330450" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/corey-gamble-image.jpg 540w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/corey-gamble-image-300x242.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/corey-gamble-image-335x270.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/corey-gamble-image-347x280.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/corey-gamble-image-520x420.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><figcaption>(E!)</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the front door, Corey says he heard Chyna yelling at Rob in anger, telling him she hated him and threatening that she &quot;would kill him.&quot;</p>
<p>After letting himself in through the unlocked door, Gamble said he saw Chyna standing by the bedroom with a rod of some sort in her hand and Rob &#8212; about seven feet away &#8212; looking red in the face and neck.</p>
<p>Once Chyna spotted Gamble?</p>
<p>She dropped this rod, he testified, and picked up a phone cord.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;She started whipping it at him,&rdquo; Gamble said under oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was hitting Rob and I got in the middle and got hit too.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to try to get her attention on me so [Rob] could get his belongings and get out of the house. I could smell the alcohol on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house was &ldquo;a mess&rdquo; Gamble continued, detailing how there were Christmas decorations strewn across the floor, along with a broken gingerbread house.</p>

<p>Rob tried to leave, Gamble went on, grabbing his keys and wallet and heading toward the driveway &#8212; but Corey&#8217;s car was blocking Kardashian&#8217;s vehicle at the time.</p>
<p>At this point, Chyna allegedly picked up a patio chair and hurled it at Rob&rsquo;s car, Gamble testified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She jumped on the back of him and punched him on the back of his head,&rdquo; Gamble said in court, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tried to get the small table to throw it at him but Rob was already in his car.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Gamble hung around the house after Rob got away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her what was going on and she yelled that she hated him &hellip; she didn&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; Gamble said. &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Why would I like this fat fucker if he wasn&rsquo;t a part of this family?&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked why he decided to intervene in the fight between the former couple, Gamble looked at the jurors and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up around that kind of behavior. That&rsquo;s why I told [Rob] that this was not going to stop. I could just tell this was something he didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="901" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-1024x901.jpg" alt="Rob &amp; JINA" class="wp-image-257931" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-1024x901.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-300x264.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-768x676.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-735x647.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-335x295.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-347x305.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-520x458.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-640x563.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina-960x845.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/rob-and-jina.jpg 1074w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(E!)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Chyna hasn&#8217;t denied getting physical with Rob in the past.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s even confessed to once holding a gun to Kardashian&#8217;s head, saying herself in court last week <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">that it was merely a joke</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in this trial, Kylie Jenner testified that Chyna once threatened to kill her, as well, and said that Tyga (who both Chyna and Kylie have dated) told her awhile back that <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-accused-of-drug-fueled-knife-attack-on-tyga-during-ka/">Chyna previously attacked him with a knife</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Those of us who have followed the legal battle between Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna have heard a lot of alarming claims.</p>
<p>Even <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">Chyna did not deny pointing a gun at Rob&#8217;s head</a> or wrapping a phone cord around his neck, claiming that these were playful moments.</p>
<p>The Kardashians and Jenners have weighed in about their experiences with Rob&#8217;s ex.</p>
<p>According to Kylie, Tyga sported a massive scar during their relationship after Chyna slashed him open with a knife.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday, April 25, Kylie Jenner took the stand during the ongoing legal struggle between Blac Chyna and her family.</p>
<p>On the witness stand, Kylie was deposed by Chyna&#8217;s attorney.</p>
<p>While there are many relevant topics &#8212; including alleged damage to a home that she owned &#8212; Kylie was asked about her relationship with Chyna.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kylie testified that she would never really consider Chyna to have been a close friend, even when things were relatively good.</p>
<p>She recalled, however, a conversation with Tyga.</p>
<p>Tyga is Kylie&#8217;s infamous ex and previously fathered a child with Chyna.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to Kylie, Tyga once displayed a six-inch scar along his arm.</p>
<p>He told Kylie that it was a knife wound that Chyna had inflicted upon him.</p>
<p>Kylie testified that Tyga had told her that Chyna abused both drugs and alcohol, which fueled the violent and injurious attack.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As the questioning continued, Kylie added that she had shared her concerns about Chyna with Rob, her older brother.</p>
<p>However, Rob told her that he planned to continue dating Chyna.</p>
<p>Kylie testified:&nbsp;&quot;I felt it was my duty to express my concerns, but ultimately it was up to him.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Also during the same hearing, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/04/25/kylie-jenner-testifies-tyga-claimed-blac-chyna-slashed-him-knife/"><em>TMZ</em></a> noted, was that Kylie was asked whether she thought that Chyna really loved Rob, or if her interest in him was fake.</p>
<p>&quot;I just felt maybe me dating the father of her child had something to do with it,&quot; she opined while under oath.</p>
<p>When asked if she believed that Chyna may have dated Rob out of spite, Kylie replied: &quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It is not shocking to hear that Chyna may have had strong, negative feelings about Tyga moving on from dating her to date Kylie Jenner.</p>
<p>But Kylie was a teenager &#8212; and a minor &#8212; when she began dating the famous foot fetishist and rapper.</p>
<p>If anyone should earn Chyna&#8217;s ire, surely it would be the grown adult man and not the high schooler &#8230; but that only applies if Chyna is a rational individual.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The story about Tyga&#8217;s injury is hearsay, and Tyga himself might need to confirm that what he told Kylie years ago is true for it to carry any weight.</p>
<p>Obviously, people sometimes lie about the origins of scars, but one would hope that no one would fabricate a story of domestic violence.</p>
<p>It is worrisome to say the least to hear two different men &#8212; Rob and allegedly Tyga &#8212; describe incidents of partner violence from Chyna.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Additional documentation from the trial shows that the Kardashians are asking the court to throw out part of the lawsuit even before it goes to the jury.</p>
<p>Their legal team argues that Chyna, who is seeking tens of millions from them in &quot;economic&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot; distress-related damages.</p>
<p>The Kardashians say that since her legal team has not even attempted to show testimony or evidence, that this portion of the suit should be dismissed entirely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Kris Jenner took the stand on Friday and, for the second consecutive day, was asked questions about her history with Blac Chyna&#8230; in the wake of Chyna suing Kris and her family members forr $100 million.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong><em>$100 million</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The Instagram influencer filed this legal complaint in 2017, alleging at the time that she suffered emotional distress as a result of ex-fiance Rob Kardashian&#8217;s social media campaign against her.</p>
<p>Chyna also alleged back then that Kris and her children conspired to have her and Rob&#8217;s reality show canceled after one season, costing her lots of money in the process.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The trial got underway with jury selection last Monday.</p>
<p>Once 12 men and women were selected, the defense opened its case by calling Blac Chyna to the stand.</p>
<p>At one point, she was cross-examined and asked about the incident from 2016 when <a href="/2020/04/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-pointed-a-gun-at-my-head/">she held a gun to Rob&#8217;s head</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;We were being silly,&quot; <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">Chyna, under oath, claimed</a> to the jurors. &quot;He thought it was funny.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jenner, however, testified a couple days later that there was nothing humorrous about what transpired.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told she put a gun to his head and she was drinking &#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine how that must feel to have a gun pointed at your head,&#8221; Jenner said on the same witness stand.</p>
<p>The altercation took place on December 14, 2016; it happened at Kylie Jenner&#8217;s home; and Chyna was accused at the time of not just&nbsp;pointing a gun at Rob &#8212; but of choking him with a phone cord&#8230; hitting him with a metal pole&#8230; and ripping open his shirt.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She tried to murder him. She put a gun to his head,&quot; Jenner said in court, tearing up after being asked by Chyna&#8217;s lawyer why she didn&#8217;t contact Chyna after the aforementioned date.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not a joke,&quot; Jenner added, citing the time &#8212; just a few weeks before the Chyna/Rob incident &#8212; when daughter Kim Karrdashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris.</p>
<p>Kris also emphasized that she didn&#8217;t pressure E! executives to pull season two of <em>Rob &amp; Chyna</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not have any influence over the E! network,&#8221; Jenner said simply.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Television producer Jeff Jenkins, who was one of the original executive producers of <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em>, previously testified that he wasn&#8217;t surprised E! axed the series because it&#8217;s &quot;very difficult to shoot a show &#8230; when they didn&#8217;t want to talk to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true:</p>
<p>After Chyna and Rob welcomed daughter Dream and got engaged, they frequentlyy fought and trashed each other on social media.</p>
<p>At his lowest point, <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-breaks-down-in-court-bawls-over-nude-photo-leak/">Rob even leaked nude photos of his ex</a> online in July 2017.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In February 2020, Judge Randolph M. Hammock severed from the current lawsuit from Chyna&#8217;s revenge porn claim against Rob and directed that it be tried separately.</p>
<p>The claim involves what Chyna&#8217;s court papers call &quot;humiliating and degrading&#8221; photos that Kardashian allegedly posted of Chyna.</p>
<p>A separate jury will hear that case after the conclusion of the current proceedings.</p>
<p>Later this month, meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are all expected to take the stand.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>During <em>her</em> testimony on Friday,&nbsp;Kris was asked about a text she sent over four years ago where she wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;He [Rob] is devastated, and he needs to ditch the bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Replied the manager and matriarch:</p>
<p>&quot;I probably could&#8217;ve used a word that was nicer.&quot;</p>

<p>But so far the biggest losers are Kim and company, because you know that with all the drama that&#8217;s been unfolding on a daily basis, the family is tortured by the fact that cameras aren&#8217;t allowed in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Yes, the <a href="/2022/04/amber-heard-confesses-love-for-johnny-depp-ahead-of-new-court-ba/">Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial</a> might be making the most headlines, but Chyna vs. the Kards is just as bonkers.</p>
<p>Take, for example, yesterday&#8217;s testimony from Kris Jenner, in which the momager revealed that Blac once threatened to <em>kill</em> Kylie Jenner!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The momager stated that she was &quot;alarmed&quot; when Kylie and then-boyfriend Tyga (who also has a child by Chyna) told her about the threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was alarming but we just kept it in the family,&rdquo; Kris said.</p>
<p>Tyga also told Kris that Chyna had attacked him with a knife and attempted to stab him.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;They lived across the street and she [Chyna] had a young child. I think we were more concerned about the Tyga situation,&quot; Kris added.</p>
<p>When Chyna&#8217;s attorney, Lynne Ciani, asked if she was concerned when Rob entered a relationship with the woman who threatened Kylie, Kris gave a surprisingly sensible answer.</p>
<p>&rdquo;I didn&rsquo;t have much of a reaction,&rdquo; Kris said.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;There was just a lot of drama &hellip; and I&rsquo;m used to that in my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Page Six <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/04/21/kris-jenner-claims-blac-chyna-threatened-to-kill-kylie-jenner/">reports</a> that Khloe Kardashian smiled at her mom&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened so fast, and we didn&rsquo;t know where their [Rob and Chyna&rsquo;s] relationship was going to go,&rdquo; Kris continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that I was not concerned. They had a rocky relationship from the start &hellip; but I love second chances and I wanted them to win.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted my son to be happy. I wanted a win for them. &hellip; You hope for the best and move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kris was then asked if she could recall a conversation in which she told a network exec that she was upset about the relationship between Rob and Chyna.</p>
<p>Kris admitted that she might have felt that way &quot;depending on the day,&rdquo; noting that there &ldquo;were a lot of ups and downs&rdquo; in the relationship.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I really wanted Chyna to grow and be the best version of herself,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kris concluded her testimony by noting that she negotiated a deal with E! execs for a seventh episode of the reality show <em>Rob &amp; Chyna</em>.</p>
<p>The episode consisted primarily of footage of Chyna giving birth to her and Rob&#8217;s daughter, Dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put that in a bank account for Dream,&rdquo; the momager said with what onlookers described as &quot;a huge smile.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a trust, earning interest.&quot;</p>
<p>Chyna is suing the Kardashians for $40 million in lost earnings and another $60 million in lost potential earnings.</p>
<p>She claims that the family did irreparable damage to her career by publicly slandering her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="841" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-841x1024.jpg" alt="Blac Chyna at the Mic" class="wp-image-271137" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-841x1024.jpg 841w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-246x300.jpg 246w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-768x935.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-1261x1536.jpg 1261w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-1681x2048.jpg 1681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-735x895.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-275x335.jpg 275w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-285x347.jpg 285w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-427x520.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-525x640.jpg 525w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-631x768.jpg 631w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-788x960.jpg 788w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/blac-chyna-at-the-mic-887x1080.jpg 887w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Of course, legal experts say that Chyna is fighting an uphill battle, as her career was never much to begin with, and she did significant damage to her own reputation by <a href="/2022/04/blac-chyna-i-was-totally-joking-when-i-pointed-a-gun-at-rob-kard/">pointing a gun at Rob&#8217;s head</a> and generally showing herself to be rather unstable.</p>
<p>Currently, Rob has primary physical custody of Dream.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as more information becomes available&nbsp;</p>
