<p>David Eason has been arrested.</p>



<p>Yes, <strong><em>again.</em></strong></p>



<p>According to The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, a website always well-versed on all things Teen Mom, the estranged and often-violent husband of Jenelle Evans spent this <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/11/12/exclusive-former-teen-mom-star-david-eason-arrested-for-violating-jenelle-evans-restraining-order-against-him-trespassing-on-the-land/">past weekend in jail</a>.</p>

<p>Eason was reportedly taken into custody on Friday for violating a domestic violence restraining order that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-granted-restraining-order-against-violent-bigoted-husband/">Evans had placed against him</a>. David was <em>also</em> charged with trespassing. </p>



<p>Both charges are misdemeanors.</p>



<p>They relate to an incident previously reported on&#8230; back in October, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/david-eason-caught-on-camera-breaking-into-exs-home-trying-to-steal-all-kinds-of-stuff/">Eason was caught on security cameras</a> breaking on to the property he formerly shared with Evans in North Carolina.</p>



<p>David, his misguided girlfriend (Kenleigh Heatwole) and a few other individuals broke through a gate at the time and attempted to steal various tools, equipment, and motor vehicles from The Land.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="548" height="308" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1.jpg" alt="You Probably Know This By Now, But..." class="wp-image-328740" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1.jpg 548w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1-480x270.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1-320x180.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1-335x188.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1-347x195.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-sort-of-smirks-1-520x292.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle and David Eason had their kids taken away by Child Protective Services not long after the latter shot and killed their family&#8217;s dog, Nugget.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Eason isn&#8217;t permitted on this property, as a result of the aforementioned protective order, and was actually escorted by a cop during the apparent break-in; the officer said he was present to supervise as Eason as retrieved his stuff from the shed.</p>



<p>“The deputy met the group and authorized them to use a SawZall tool to cut the lock of the gate leading onto the North Carolina property,” a local source told The Ashley last month. </p>



<p>“The deputy was under the impression that David was authorized to take the ATVs, motorcycles, dirt bikes, etc. but he was not.”</p>



<p>A county court clerk has confirmed that Eason was arrested on November 8 by the Pender County Sheriff’s Office and released on November 10 via a $1,000 bond set by the Magistrate to encompass both charges mentioned above.</p>

Studios on April 9, 2016 in Burbank, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans and Eason share one biological daughter and split up in March after many contentious years as husband and wife.</p>



<p>The latest drama between the spouses (excluding this arrest) centers on a troubling allegation leveled against her ex by Evans.</p>



<p>In testimony from a recent divorce hearing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jenelle-evans-accuses-david-eason-of-being-a-pedophile-in-brand-new-recording/">Evans said she came across</a> materials related to the “sexual exploitation of a minor&#8221; on David&#8217;s phone at some point in the past.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t elaborate. We aren&#8217;t privy to any other details in this case.</p>



<p>But Evans accuses Eason of not being fit to be around their child, Ensley, and asks that he is kept away from her until he undergoes a “psychological evaluation.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans went on to say that filed a police report back when she made this discovery &#8212; and then, on social media, the Teen Mom 2 alum wrote that she had reported what she had supposedly found to “police, FBI and custody court.”</p>



<p>We can’t say at the moment just where any kind of investigation stands in regard to this potentially ugly issue.</p>



<p>All we know right now is that Jenelle&#8217;s protective order expires next month and that Eason is due in court next month to answer for these new criminal charges.</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans leveled quite the serious allegation against David Eason.</p>



<p>As you likely know by now, Evans finally split from her violent husband back in March, stating at the time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Eason was a deadbeat dad and a drunk</a>.</p>



<p>Now, however, via a recording from a recent divorce hearing during which Evans spoke in further detail about Eason and their marriage… the Teen Mom 2 alum has said something even more damning.</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="899" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1024x899.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1024x899.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-768x674.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-2048x1798.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-960x843.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1080x948.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1200x1054.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason and Jenelle Evans attend the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (GETTY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, you can actually <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/11/08/exclusive-audio-hear-former-teen-mom-star-jenelle-evans-accuse-her-estranged-husband-david-eason-in-court-of-having-items-related-to-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor/">watch a tearful Evans testify</a> that she found memory cards from Eason&#8217;s phone that she says contained materials related to the “<strong>sexual exploitation of a minor</strong>.&#8221;</p>



<p>No other details are provided.</p>



<p>However, Evans accuses Eason of not being fit to be around their daughter, Ensley, and asks that he is kept away from her until he undergoes a “psychological evaluation.”</p>



<p>The judge <em>does</em> award Jenelle temporary legal and physical of the seven-year at the end of the hearing, although the allegations about Eason having child sex exploitation materials are not addressed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans went on to say that filed a police report back when she made this discovery &#8212; and then, on social media, Jenelle wrote that she had reported what she had supposedly found to “police, FBI and custody court.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say at the moment just where any kind of investigation stands.</p>



<p>In the wake of her divorce filing, Evans has moved to Las Vegas.</p>



<p>But the drama with Eason isn&#8217;t finished, as security cameras caught in a short while ago breaking into the property he formerly shared with his wife in North Carolina and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/david-eason-caught-on-camera-breaking-into-exs-home-trying-to-steal-all-kinds-of-stuff/">trying to take back some of his stuff</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elsewhere, but relatedly it seems, Kenleigh Heatwole is dating Eason for some reason right now.</p>



<p>Shortly after Jenelle&#8217;s bombshell audio went public, she wrote the following on Instagram:</p>



<p>“Playing victim in situations they’ve created and then flip the story to manipulate people to think they are innocent.&#8221;</p>



<p>In another reel, Heatwole said she felt the same way as a person who thought:</p>



<p><em>Me trying to decide if I’m gonna stay calm or if I’m about to undo all my personal growth and say the most horrible things that will stay with them forever.</em></p>

<p>Eason himself has not yet responded to his ex-wife&#8217;s latest accusations.</p>



<p>For her part, though, Kenleigh recently defended herself against those wondering why the heck she was dating some such as David Eason.</p>



<p>“He’s a lot sweeter than people portray him to be,” she insisted during an Instagram Live session.</p>

<p>The drama continues for Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>Over the past several days alone, we&#8217;ve reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-again/">Evans has been cut from Teen Mom</a> once again&#8230; and also that she has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-grandmother-amid-domestic-violence-scandal-report/">sent one of her kids away</a> to live with his grandmother.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile, we appear to have evidence that her estranged husband, David Eason, broke into her home on Sunday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="945" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1024x945.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1024x945.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-768x709.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-960x886.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1080x997.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1200x1108.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862.jpg 1903w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans and David Eason attends the 2016 MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros. Studios on April 9, 2016 in Burbank, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (GETTY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on surveillance footage from Jenelle&#8217;s home in North Carolina, Eason, his girlfriend and three others cut off the locks to this property on Sunday night using bolt-cutters.</p>



<p>They proceeded to load up a number of motorcycles and other items from Jenelle&#8217;s garage and place them inside of a trailer.</p>



<p>TMZ has <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/22/jenelle-evans-claims-ex-david-eason-broke-into-property/">actually obtained footage</a> from this attempted robbery, which was brought to Jenelle&#8217;s attention thanks to an alert from her Ring camera system.</p>



<p>According to both TMZ and also The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, Eason brought a local deputy with him as an escort, who was under the impression that Eason was permitted to pick up these vehicles and items.</p>

<p>Evans is currently residing in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>As part of her divorce proceedings from Eason, she has taken out an order of protection against her often-violent ex.</p>



<p>The Ashley writes that Evans was “screaming via the Ring camera” at the on-scene officer to make it clear that Eason was <em><strong>not</strong></em> allowed to take any of the bikes, tools and/or pieces of yard equipment that were being swiped “right in full view of the cameras.”</p>



<p>The Ashley’s insider said that Jenelle then called the Sherriff’s Office and spoke to a Sergeant.</p>



<p>Once he was forced to put everything back, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/10/22/david-eason-attempt-break-into-jenelle-evans-home-on-the-land-nearly-gets-arrested-for-trying-to-take-motorbikes-exclusive-details/">Eason got into an argument</a> with the deputy and, naturally, &#8220;narrowly avoided getting arrested,&#8221; this source adds.</p>

<p>Eason and Evans are scheduled to come face-to-face next month for a hearing in regard to their divorce.</p>



<p>Earlier this summer, on an episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-again/">Evans referred to Eason</a> as &#8220;mentally abusive&#8221; and also told Briana DeJesus:</p>



<p>“He would throw objects, put holes in walls,&#8221; explaining of her move to Nevada:</p>



<p>“I feel like so much stuff has happened that it’s like, ‘I’ve got to get out and relocate and get that fresh start, leave all the bad memories behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alas, it sort of feels like there will never be an end to this saga, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-evans-reveals-intention-to-move-to-las-vegas">Jenelle Evans Reveals Intention to Move to Las Vegas</h2>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-returns-to-teen-mom-franchise-following-david-eason-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle was fired from the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise</a> in 2019, it was largely due to David&#8217;s violent behavior.</p>



<p>Now that he&#8217;s out of the picture, she&#8217;s been permitted to return to the show that made her famous.</p>



<p>The Vegas bombshell came during a confessional in which Jenelle spoke candidly about her efforts to protect herself and her kids from her unstable ex.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="696" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-840011444-696x1024.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans attends the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.

<p>&#8220;I think Vegas is definitely gonna be a space &#8212; life my safe haven and definitely a good safe haven for my kids. There&#8217;s just so much to look forward to for this move to Vegas,&#8221; Jenelle said.</p>



<p>&#8220;So much has happened in North Carolina, it&#8217;s just traumatized all of us in different ways,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>But despite her eagerness to set up her new life in Nevada, Jenelle was forced to return to North Carolina for a court date with David.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to be here. But this week, I have a court case for a pending restraining order, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes,&#8221; she explained in a voice-over.</p>

<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel safe when I&#8217;m in North Carolina, because I don&#8217;t know if or where I can run into David.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s just capable of intimidating me. I feel harassed. I feel stalked. Now, every white truck on the highway, I&#8217;m staring at, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s him,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-s-fight-for-freedom">Jenelle&#8217;s Fight For Freedom</h2>



<p>Over the course of her marriage, Jenelle took a lot of flak for defending <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jenelle-evans-this-is-why-i-finally-left-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David&#8217;s abusive behavior</a> toward children and animals.</p>

<p>Now, however, it appears that her actions were at least partially motivated by fear.</p>





<p>&#8220;My nerves are shot. I keep having panic attacks,&#8221; Jenelle told the camera.</p>



<p> &#8220;I keep thinking how I have to go on stand. It&#8217;s just all very scary. And I&#8217;m like, shaking. But I gotta do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sick of feeling this way. And even though he&#8217;s not here, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m still walking on eggshells, which sucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following the hearing, Jenelle revealed to castmate Briana DeJesus that she was granted a six-month <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-granted-restraining-order-against-violent-bigoted-husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restraining order against David</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;All these fears in my head are just poof, gone now,&#8221; said a triumphant Evans.</p>



<p>Jenelle was recently spotted partying on the Las Vegas strip, so we guess the move went well.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s taken some criticism for leaving her kids at home to go out clubbing. But hey &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t be Jenelle if she weren&#8217;t stirring up controversy!</p>

<p>David Eason has reportedly found someone new to treat like absolute $hit.</p>



<p>The former Teen Mom star, who was fired by MTV years ago for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/">shooting and killing his family&#8217;s young dog</a>, is no longer married to Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>The polarizing cable network personality <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">filed to separate from Eason</a> in March.</p>



<p>He doesn&#8217;t seem very broken up about it, however.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="897" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1024x897.jpg" alt="David Eason and two kids" class="wp-image-503343" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1024x897.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-768x673.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-960x841.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1080x947.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1200x1052.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688.jpg 1796w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason, Marissa Eason and Ensley Eason attend the Cosmopolitan NYFW fashion show during New York Fashion Week at Tribeca 360 on February 08, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on a number of recent TikTok videos, Eason is now dating someone named Kenleigh Heatwole.</p>



<p>On this social media platform, the often-violent bigot has turned the camera on himself while inside Kenleigh’s house&#8230; while making some meals in her kitchen&#8230; and also while singing, jet-skiing and, of course, throwing back some drinks at a bar.</p>



<p>Based on research conducted by our friends <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/07/02/david-eason-shows-off-his-new-galpal-plus-an-update-on-his-divorce-from-teen-mom-star-jenelle-evans-exclusive-details/">at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>, it sounds as if:</p>



<p>Kenleigh is 25 years old.</p>



<p>She owns property in North Carlina.</p>



<p>She is a photographer and graphic designer.</p>



<p>She enjoys hunting, boating, and owns a Doberman &#8212; who should likely sleep with one eye open any time Eason is around.</p>

<p>In her aforementioned legal documents, Evans wrote that she has every &#8220;intent&#8221; to make her separation &#8220;permanent.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Throughout the duration of the marriage of the parties, the defendant has exhibited concerning and at times disturbing behavior towards the plaintiff,” she wrote in an attempt to expose Eason, later bringing up the incident that caused the couple to lost custody of its kids for about a month years ago:</p>



<p>“In May of 2019, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/jenelle-evans-david-eason-beat-and-killed-our-dog-because-thats/">Defendant shot and killed the family’s pet</a> French Bulldog Nugget in front of the minor child.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this same filing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Evans referenced the current felony charge</a> hanging over her spouse, which is the result of an alleged assault of her teenage son, Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle writes, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all been very ugly for a long time surrounding Eason, who has responded by claiming <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/david-eason-jenelle-evans-is-a-thief/">Evans is a thief</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not about to take sides in this messy split, but we are asking that Kenleigh Heatwole perhaps reconsider her romantic future.</p>

<p>Evans, for her part, was linked a short time ago to her manager, August Keen.</p>



<p>In her own recent TikTok video, we can Evans grab a man&#8217;s arm while the track “I Like The Way You Kiss Me” plays in the background.</p>



<p>However, after this rumor started to circulate around the Internet, Keen told In Touch Weekly simply:</p>



<p>&#8220;Jenelle is single.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans had her (latest) day in court on May 16.</p>



<p>The reality star &#8212; who has officially booked her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-returns-to-teen-mom-franchise-following-david-eason-split/">return to the Teen Mom franchise</a> &#8212; was granted a six-month restraining order on Thursday against her estranged husband, David Eason.</p>



<p>The legal document makes it illegal over that time period for Eason to contact Evans &#8230; to be on her property in North Carolina&#8230; and from talking about Jenelle at all on social media.</p>

<p>According to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Realty Roundup, both s<a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/05/16/david-eason-accuses-jenelle-evans-in-court-of-being-a-drug-addict-jenelle-defends-her-xanax-use-cries-when-asked-about-her-mother-barbara-exclusive/">pouses took to the stand</a> at this hearing.</p>



<p>“David accused her of being a drug addict, and said that Jenelle has taken Xanax the whole time they’ve been together,” a source told this website. </p>



<p>“Jenelle rebutted the claim that she’s a drug addict, and said she was prescribed Xanax and has been taking it for the last three years to help with her esophagus spasms. </p>



<p>&#8220;She told the judge that if she gets nervous or anxious, it will flare up her esophagus spasms and she will throw up.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Evans filed to separate from Eason</a> in February, stating at the time that her estranged husband was a drunk and a deadbeat dad.</p>



<p>The couple is parents to a young daughter named Ensley, while David has a teenage daughter from a previous relationship and Jenelle has a son named Kaiser with ex-Nathan Griffith and a son named Jace with ex Andrew Lewis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Eason was previously charged with a felony</a> for allegedly strangling Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle wrote in her separation filing, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>

<p>As for why a judge affirmed an order of protection at this hearing on Thursday, the aforementioned insider told The Ashley:</p>



<p>“The reason it was granted basically was that the amount of times David texted or talked about Jenelle could count as harassment.</p>



<p>&#8220;The judge granted it on the fact that Jenelle’s lawyer specifically claimed it was harassment, because David constantly talks about her, whether it’s in texts or social media or whatever. </p>



<p>&#8220;The restraining order was basically because they proved David was ‘harassing’ Jenelle.” </p>



<p>Indeed, Eason recently said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/david-eason-jenelle-evans-is-a-thief/">Evans was a thief and a cheater</a>.</p>

<p>Evans will need to re-file for another restraining order at these six months are up.</p>



<p>If Eason breaks the current one, he&#8217;ll be arrested and subjected to 48 hours in jail.</p>



<p>“He has some dark secrets no one knows but me,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jenelle-evans-im-afraid-my-husband-will-murder-me/">Evans told people on the Internet</a> in late April, saying she wasn&#8217;t permitted to say much more at the time due to an ongoing investigation&#8230; but adding in cryptic fashion that <em>IF</em> she did spill any of this tea:</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m scared and feel like my life would be on the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may not believe this, but David Eason has some mean things to say about Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>The often-violent former reality star jumped on TikTok this past Saturday to both defend himself and also to tear into his estranged spouse, who finally <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">filed to separate from Eason in March</a>.</p>



<p>Amid accusations from Evans that he&#8217;s a drunk and deadbeat dad, Eason addressed speculation over the weekend that he&#8217;s in financial trouble by pointing a harsh finger in the direction of his ex.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="876" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-1024x876.jpg" alt="David Eason and ex-wife" class="wp-image-499214" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-1024x876.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-300x257.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-768x657.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-2048x1751.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-960x821.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-1080x923.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1173002572-1200x1026.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Eason and David Eason attend ELF SACK at InstaSleep Mint Melts Presents New York Fashion Week Nolcha Shows Spring/Summer 2020 on September 7, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for Nolcha)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I would be making a lot more money but Jenelle took my money from me!” he told followers. </p>



<p>“If y’all want to know the truth! You’re all sitting out here talking about how I’m using her money. Well, how am I getting her money?”</p>



<p>Jenelle, of course, has tried to answer this question in the past.</p>



<p>According to a police report obtained by our friends at The Ashley’s Reality Roundup, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-to-police-help-my-husband-is-stealing-from-me/">Evans called local authorities</a> in North Carolina on March 6 to report that Eason had stolen her drivers license, her wallet and her credit cards.</p>



<p>This call was made just days after she filed for separation.</p>

<p>During this most recent TikTok exchange with all 12 or so of his fans, Eason said Jenelle “took all his clients” from him, presumably making a reference to his boat-cleaning business.</p>



<p>“She deleted everything on my phone, remotely,” Eason said, accidentally praising his ex for apparently having some impressive technological skills and adding: </p>



<p>“It cost me a lot of money.”</p>



<p>Eason has only spoken out a few times on his split from Jenelle, previously telling people on social media that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/david-eason-claims-jenelle-evans-cheated-on-him-threatens-to-eat-tiktok-users-dog/">Evans cheated on him a lot</a>.</p>

<p>“Why did we split? Because Jenelle cheated on me. She’s been cheating for years, actually,&#8221; Eason said about two months ago.</p>



<p>In legal documents obtained by The Sun several days prior to this allegation by David, Evans cited February 16 as the official date of the break-up and stating she has the “intent that the separation be permanent.”</p>



<p>She referred to “disturbing behavior” on the part of Eason, even bringing up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/jenelle-evans-david-eason-beat-and-killed-our-dog-because-thats/">David having killed the family dog</a> in 2019.</p>



<p>When a TikTok user also mentioned this homicide back in March? Eason responded by naming the dead animal and firing back as follows:</p>



<p>“Where’s your f-cking Nugget? I will eat that motherf-cker! I’ll put hot sauce on his ass. I’ll make a jacket out of that motherf-cker.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="694" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-694x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-499304" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-694x1024.jpg 694w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-203x300.jpg 203w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-768x1134.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-1387x2048.jpg 1387w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-650x960.jpg 650w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-732x1080.jpg 732w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-813x1200.jpg 813w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-scaled.jpg 1734w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans and David Eason appear to have brought out the worst in each other.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking ahead, meanwhile, Eason doesn&#8217;t see himself walking down the aisle ever again.</p>



<p>“I’m not gonna say I’ll never date again, but I’ll never get married again!” Eason said on May 4 via TikTok. “That’s for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: “There’s no reason to get married to anybody, ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sorry, ladies. Sounds like you won&#8217;t have a chance to lock down David Eason.</p>

<p>By his own admission, David Eason doesn&#8217;t always value the lives of others.</p>



<p>Case in most famous point?</p>



<p>The former Teen Mom participant <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/">shot and killed his family&#8217;s pet dog</a> back in 2019, prompting a Child Protective Services investigation and causing everyone to think of him as a fairly awful person.</p>



<p>Eason hasn&#8217;t done much in the years since to change our opinion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="888" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1024x888.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans with ex David Eason" class="wp-image-498758" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-300x260.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-768x666.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-960x832.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1080x936.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1200x1040.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862.jpg 1903w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans attends the 2016 MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros.

<p>Now, meanwhile, Jenelle Evans says she&#8217;s afraid her estranged husband will move from murdering animals to murdering human beings.</p>



<p>Specifically, herself.</p>



<p>Via an Instagram Q&amp;A on April 26, Evans said the following about Eason:</p>



<p>“Everything he’s saying he’s just doing it to make himself ‘look better’ but in actuality he knows the person he truly is behind closed doors.</p>



<p>&#8220;He has some dark secrets no one knows but me.”</p>

<p>Early last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Evans filed to separate from Eason</a>.</p>



<p>She wrote in legal papers at the time that Eason was a deadbeat father and a drunk.</p>



<p>“Throughout the duration of the marriage of the parties, the defendant has exhibited concerning and at times disturbing behavior towards the plaintiff,” she wrote at one point, citing the aforementioned violent act against the family dog as evidence.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in this filing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Evans references the current felony charge</a> hanging over her spouse, which is the result of an alleged assault of her young son, Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle writes, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-681x1024.jpg" alt="David Eason and Jenelle Evans in 2016" class="wp-image-498760" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-1362x2048.jpg 1362w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-798x1200.jpg 798w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-597192138-scaled.jpg 1703w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason and Jenelle Evans attend the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards at Madison Square Garden on August 28, 2016 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back to the Q&amp;A&#8230;</p>



<p>When asked to divulge said secrets, Evans &#8212; who recently requested a domestic violence restraining order against David for herself and her children &#8212; said she was unable to do so.</p>



<p>“Not the right time but also I’m scared and feel like my life would be on the line,” she said, implying Eason would hurt her and later adding: </p>



<p>“There’s a huge investigation going on so I can’t comment on much at the moment.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-683x1024.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans photograph" class="wp-image-498761" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1095004128-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans  attends the Indonesian Diversity FW19 Collections: 2Madison Avenue, Alleira Batik, Dian Pelangi and Itang Yunas front row during New York Fashion Week: The Shows at Industria Studios on February 7, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images for Indonesian Diversity)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In another reply to another follower, Jenelle explained that she’s frightened of David due to “the way he talks about people he hates,” alleging he has “threatened his baby mama’s life” and is controlling, demanding and selfish, among other things. </p>



<p>&#8220;Even his own daughter doesn’t want to live with him,&#8221; Evans said of Ensley, the toddler she shares with Eason.</p>



<p>Jenelle labeled Eason as &#8220;abusive,&#8221; but also said she has no regrets about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/jenelle-evans-boasts-that-life-is-good-as-david-eason-prepares-to-act-as-his-own-attorney-at-child-abuse-hearing/">standing by his side for so long</a>, stating on social media:</p>



<p>&#8216;I don’t regret that time because I learned a lot of life lessons that were very important for me to grow up and mature. Life is easier to understand I would say. I always have learned from by mistakes and he was def a big mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in 2019 Jenelle Evans&#8217; husband, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Eason, shot and killed her pet dog</a>, a small French bulldog named Nugget.</p>



<p>At the time, Jenelle defended David&#8217;s actions, and they both claimed that the dog presented a dangerous threat to their children and needed to be put down.</p>



<p>These days, however, Jenelle is singing a very different tune.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle separated from David</a>, alleging publicly that he was an abusive, cheating alcoholic.</p>

<p>Now, Jenelle is claiming that David recently took the life of yet another of her beloved pets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-evans-david-eason-killed-my-dog-again">Jenelle Evans: David Eason Killed My Dog. Again.</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/10989810/jenelle-evans-david-eason-ran-over-puppy-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>, Jenelle has obtained a protective order against David.</p>



<p>In court documents obtained by the outlet, Jenelle&#8217;s attorney describes an incident in which David ran over her dog, an event that she claims was witnessed by David&#8217;s teenage daughter.</p>



<p>&#8220;David has an argument with Jenelle outside of house in the driveway,&#8221; the complaint reads.</p>

<p>&#8220;David storms off, gets into Jenelle&#8217;s Toyota Sequoia to drive away without asking Jenelle&#8217;s permission, pulls out really fast, ran over a puppy, and killed it,&#8221; the description continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kids were at school but stepdaughter [David&#8217;s daughter Maryssa, 16] was home at the time and witnessed the dog dying. David also witnessed the dog dying.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jenelle previously referenced the incident in a social media post.</p>

<p>At the time, she seemed to suggest that the dog was Maryssa&#8217;s pet, writing:</p>



<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask him what he did to 2 of the puppies? He wants to talk sh-t about me well he&#8217;s the one that didn&#8217;t keep them safe. One of them was his daughters [sic].&#8221;</p>



<p>The legal complaint goes on to allege that Jenelle has PTSD as a result of her years of coping with David&#8217;s violent outbursts.</p>

<p>Jenelle claims that David &#8220;has exhibited emotionally abusive behavior to and in the presence of the minor children.&#8221;</p>



<p>She says that his &#8220;behavior causes a heightened level of anxiety for all three children in the home, and he has a history of physically acting out to include punching or hitting holes and walls, throwing objects, stealing items from Jenelle.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-david-gets-served">David Gets Served</h2>



<p>In addition to being served with the protective order this week, David was reportedly served with papers that formalize his legal <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/david-eason-jenelle-evans-cheated-on-me-sooo-many-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separation from Jenelle</a>.</p>

<p>David Eason has some mean things to say about Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>The former reality star and persistent bigot went back and forth with TikTok users a few days ago, responding at the time his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">wife&#8217;s decision to separate from him</a>.</p>



<p>Eason told his fans during this chat <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/david-eason-claims-jenelle-evans-cheated-on-him-threatens-to-eat-tiktok-users-dog/">that Evans had cheated on him</a>, claiming this infidelity was the basis for the couple&#8217;s split.</p>



<p>(Evans, for her part, pointed to patterns of &#8220;disturbing behavior&#8221; by Eason as among the reasons for her filing.)</p>

<p>In a follow-up interview with Celebuzz on Thursday, Eason reiterated this allegation against his estranged spouse.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have mountains of evidence about her cheating,” <a href="https://www.celebuzz.com/g/exclusive-david-eason-claims-that-jenelle-evans-was-unfaithful-with-dozens-of-guys/2/">Eason now tells Celebuzz</a>, not actually providing any of this supposed evidence and yet adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;She cheated on me with dozens of guys and I have all the evidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps Eason will provide this evidence at some point.</p>

<p>“It’s been the hardest thing in the world to look her in the face after years knowing she was telling other men that she wanted them to come to my house to be with her,” Eason continued, trashing Evans for telling these guys that he&#8217;s a &#8220;piece of sh-t&#8221; and also stating:</p>



<p>“She’s been ready for a new man to move in for a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jenelle, of course, made no mention of any cheating in her separation filing.</p>



<p>Instead, she cited David&#8217;s history of violence, writing in the document how, &#8220;in May of 2019, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/jenelle-evans-david-eason-beat-and-killed-our-dog-because-thats/">Defendant shot and killed the family’s pet</a> French Bulldog Nugget in front of the minor child.”</p>



<p>Jenelle also claims that David &#8220;told her to kill herself among other vile insults,&#8221; and that she recorded these interactions for her safety.</p>

<p>Eason has a very different story to tell, however.</p>



<p>He says he&#8217;s happy to have his old life back now because no friends or loved ones wanted to be around Jenelle when the pair were married.</p>



<p>“She has a problem with every single person — every friend of mine, every family member of mine. She’s pushed them all out of my life,&#8221; Eason said this week on TikTok. </p>



<p>As for accusations that he&#8217;s broke? And a deadbeat?</p>



<p>“That bitch ain’t got no money! She never had money because she always blows it,” Eason ranted on TikTok of Evans, claiming that he has a well-paying job of fixing up boats.</p>

<p>Eason and Evans shared a seven-year old daughter named Ensley; the former also has a daughter from a previous relationship, while the latter has a nine-year old son with ex Nathan Griffith.</p>



<p>In his new statement to Celebuzz, Eason said that he is “so much happier and healthier without Jenelle,&#8221; going on as follows:</p>



<p>“The stress I was under was making me physically sick. I&#8217;m so glad I don&#8217;t have to wake up to extreme anxiety every morning now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Contrary to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wont-let-me-file-for-divorce/">this report</a>, meanwhile, Eason says he&#8217;s ready to sign divorce papers right here, and right now.</p>
