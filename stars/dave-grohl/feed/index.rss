<p>Several months ago, we learned something salacious about Foo Fighters member Dave Grohl:</p>



<p>He had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/">fathered a child out of wedlock</a>.</p>



<p>“I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage,” the musician wrote on Instagram, admitting to the infidelity and paternity and adding:</p>



<p>“I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1024x746.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522173" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-768x559.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-2048x1492.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-960x699.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1080x787.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1200x874.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl of rock band Foo Fighters performs on the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival on July 5, 2024 in Roskilde, Denmark. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (HELLE ARENSBAK/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The question since this time, of course, has been: Did Grohl successfully regain his wife&#8217;s trust?</p>



<p>Or is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohl-divorce/">Jordyn Blum still thinking about filing for divorce</a>?</p>



<p>“Jordyn has forgiven Dave and is trying to move on,” a source says in latest issue of Us Weekl. &#8220;She is [still] completely devastated by the situation but is standing by his side.”</p>



<p>For now, at least, it seems.</p>

<p>As cited above, Grohl and Blum marriage made headlines last year after the star revealed his affair and subsequent love child. </p>



<p>Grohl and Blum themselves are the parents of daughters Violet, 18, Harper, 15, and Ophelia, 10.</p>



<p>According to this tabloid insider, Grohl and Blum have put in the work to keep their family together. Again, <em>for now</em>.</p>



<p>“They are going to counseling, and Dave has been doing anything he can to win back Jordyn’s trust,” the source says of the couple. “Neither of them wants the family broken.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="852" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1024x852.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl and wife Jordyn Blum attend Paul McCartney's &amp; Nancy Shevell's party at The Bowery Hotel on October 21, 2011 in New York City." class="wp-image-519882" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1024x852.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-300x250.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-768x639.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-2048x1705.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-960x799.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1080x899.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1200x999.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl and wife Jordyn Blum attend Paul McCartney&#8217;s &amp; Nancy Shevell&#8217;s party at The Bowery Hotel on October 21, 2011 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For the record, the name of Grohl&#8217;s mistress has been revealed; it is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jennifer-young-comes-forward-as-mother-of-dave-grohls-child/">Jennifer Young</a>.</p>



<p>From what we can gather, the singer is not involved with raising her baby.</p>



<p>After news of the cheating scandal broke, Blum was spotted without her wedding ring, fueling chatter that she and Grohl were headed for a break-up. </p>



<p>The Foo Fighters subsequently canceled their performance at the Soundside Music Festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which was scheduled for September 2024.</p>



<p>The spouses <em>did</em> spend the holidays late last year with each other in California, however.</p>



<p>Blum, meanwhile, has not addressed any part of this controversy in public.</p>

<p>For several days now, Dave Grohl&#8217;s mistress&#8217; identity has been a hot topic of conversation on social media.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grohl has admitted to fathering a child </a>with a woman who is not his wife of more than 20 years, Jordyn Blum.</p>



<p>In announcing his child&#8217;s birth on social media, the Foo Fighters frontman offered no information regarding the mother&#8217;s identity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-admits-to-extramarital-affair">Dave Grohl Admits to Extramarital Affair</h2>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage. I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her,&#8221; Grohl wrote on Instagram on Monday.</p>



<p>Grohl went on to admit that he had betrayed his wife and daughters and revealed that he plans to work hard to &#8220;regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful for your consideration toward all the children involved, as we move forward together,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-mistress-identity-what-do-we-know">Dave Grohl Mistress&#8217; Identity: What Do We Know?</h2>



<p>The identity of Grohl&#8217;s mistress remains a mystery. But gossip outlet <a href="https://www.deuxmoi.world/latest/dave-grohl-announces-birth-of-child-outside-of-marriage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeuxMoi</a> has offered new information courtesy of a tip from an anonymous informant.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dave is currently not living in the family home, but instead he is living in a home Jordyn recently renovated for her business,&#8221; the insider writes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t name the new baby&#8217;s mother, but she was well known to both Dave and Jordyn since 2017,&#8221; the source claims.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dave was not present for the birth but has been to see his new daughter multiple times. His other daughters have not yet met their sister.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1547234981-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters performs onstage during Harley-Davidson's Homecoming Festival - Day 2 at Veterans Park on July 15, 2023 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

<p></p>



<p>The insider goes on to claim that Grohl has been &#8220;struggling&#8221; since the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/taylor-hawkins-cause-of-death-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death of his friend and bandmate Taylor Hawkins</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>But, the insider says, &#8220;none of that can excuse what he has done to his family&#8221; and &#8220;divorce is definitely looking like an option.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-start-of-the-rumors">The Start of the Rumors</h2>



<p>DeuxMoi has long been considered one of the most credible gossip outlets. And they were the first to report on rumors that Grohl was cheating on his wife.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dave-grohls-baby-mother-33641935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a></em>, the proprietor of the site alleged in a 2023 podcast interview that Grohl had been unfaithful.</p>



<p>The revelation prompted a series of Reddit threads about Grohl&#8217;s alleged infidelity. </p>



<p>&#8220;This frontman aka nice guy that was once in the most popular 90s band of all time isn&#8217;t the perfect guy you think he is. I&#8217;ve known him to have a muse/lover for years,&#8221; wrote one user.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been seen with him at multiple shows and events in different cities over the years. Can&#8217;t believe this has never got out bc they were so obvious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s cooled down now but def went on strong for a while. I wonder if his marriage is open? I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t the only girl,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>Grohl has been keeping a low profile this week for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ll continue to keep you updated on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Do Dave Grohl and Taylor Swift have a beef? Well, now they do!</p>



<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/travis-kelce-performs-on-stage-with-taylor-swift-sends-universe-into-delirium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift&#8217;s <em>Eras </em>world tour performances</a> in London delighted fans. But even so, she has her critics.</p>



<p>Dave Grohl and his band, Foo Fighters, also performed in London for the first weekend of summer. Grohl made some comments that seemed to imply that he was accusing Taylor of not performing live.</p>



<p>What does Taylor have to say to that?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-cracked-a-joke-about-the-errors-tour">Dave Grohl cracked a joke about &#8216;The Errors Tour&#8217;</h2>



<p>While Taylor Swift was performing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/will-travis-kelce-be-at-taylor-swift-london-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium</a> on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Dave Grohl and his Foo Fighters band played London Stadium.</p>



<p>“So we like to call our tour the ‘Errors Tour,’” Grohl jokes on stage.</p>



<p>“We’ve had more than a few eras, and more than a few f&#8211;king errors as well,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Just a couple. That’s because we actually play live.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl in September of 2023." class="wp-image-502578" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl performs onstage during the launch of the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative at the U.S. Department of State on September 27, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Grohl is not a household name in the way that Taylor Swift is. However, many people do know of him. He&#8217;s one of the biggest faces in the realm of mainstream rock music.</p>



<p>He was also once a member of Nirvana.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s some random singer at open mic night getting people&#8217;s attention by (possibly) shading someone famous. This is an established, major name within the realm of music.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-dave-grohl-shading-taylor-swift">Was Dave Grohl shading Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>“What?!” Grohl remarked to his audience. “Just saying. You guys like raw, live rock ‘n’ roll music, right? You came to the right f&#8211;king place.”</p>



<p>Earlier in the night, he had mentioned the Eras world tour to his audience &#8212; which apparently prompted boos.</p>



<p>To that, Dave Grohl simply responded: “I tell you, man, you don’t want to suffer the wrath of Taylor Swift.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="733" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-733x1024.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl in March of 2024." class="wp-image-502580" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-733x1024.jpg 733w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-215x300.jpg 215w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-768x1073.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-1466x2048.jpg 1466w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-687x960.jpg 687w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-773x1080.jpg 773w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-859x1200.jpg 859w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-scaled.jpg 1833w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl performs onstage during the Eighth Annual LOVE ROCKS NYC Benefit Concert For God&#8217;s Love We Deliver at Beacon Theatre on March 07, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for LOVE ROCKS NYC/God&#8217;s Love We Deliver)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, a lot of people on social media &#8212; particularly Swifties and Swift-haters alike &#8212; were quick to assume that Grohl was shading Swift.</p>



<p>At the same time, many have recalled <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-32871300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Grohl&#8217;s commentary</a> at BBC Radio 1&#8217;s Big Weekend in 2015, during which he told a crowd that he felt &#8220;obsessed&#8221; with Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>A lot can change in nine years. Did he go from dedicating a song to her to insulting her as an artist and a performer in order to appease a crowd of Swift-hating weirdos?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-taylor-swift-perform-live-her-response-to-dave-grohl-s-shade">Does Taylor Swift Perform Live? Her Response To Dave Grohl&#8217;s Shade</h2>



<p>On Sunday, June 23, Taylor Swift once again performed at Wembley Stadium. During that performance, Taylor paid tribute to her band.</p>



<p>“Every one of my band members, every single one of our crew, my band &#8212; who’s gonna be playing live for you for three and a half hours tonight &#8212; they deserve this so much,” she praised.</p>



<p>You can see multiple videos of Taylor saying just that <a href="https://x.com/swifferupdates/status/1804960268239429968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Twitter</a> and elsewhere on social media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/swifferupdates/status/1804960268239429968
</div></figure>



<p>It is entirely possible that Taylor&#8217;s remark was simply a tribute to her band, reminding everyone of their hard work.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/taylor-swift-eras-tour-its-coming-to-an-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Eras </em>world tour won&#8217;t last forever</a>. These professionals deserve recognition &#8212; and also to work in the future. This is their job, and no matter how well Taylor pays them, they&#8217;ll one day likely want to work again.</p>



<p>If Taylor Swift <em>did </em>say this to clap back at Dave Grohl&#8217;s, then she did it delicately, diplomatically, and masterfully.</p>
