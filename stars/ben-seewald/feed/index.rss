<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/ben-seewald-is-too-immature-for-jessa-duggar-relationship-expert-says/">Jessa Duggar married Ben Seewald</a> back in 2014, it looked like a match made in heaven.</p>



<p>Ben and Jessa shared similar views, and most importantly, they had the approval of her domineering father.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/jim-bob-duggar-all-the-wild-beliefs-and-shocking-scandals-of-reality-tvs-most-controversial-father/">Jim Bob Duggar makes all the rules</a> in his household, and his daughters aren&#8217;t allowed to date anyone without his approval.</p>



<p>In fact, potential suitors are forced to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/duggar-family-courtship-questionnaire-revealed-bizarre/">fill out a 45-page questionnaire before they can date a Duggar daughter</a>. </p>



<p>Ben was only the second guy to pass all of Jim Bob&#8217;s tests.</p>



<p>So we know that he has Jim Bob&#8217;s approval, but how does <em>Jessa</em> wife feel about Ben a decade after tying the knot?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-ben-amp-jessa-still-married">Are Ben &amp; Jessa Still Married?</h2>



<p>Yes, they are &#8212; but if you ask those who are watching the pair closely, they won&#8217;t be for much longer!</p>



<p>Some observers believe she wasn&#8217;t thrilled with him to begin with, and her opinion has soured further in recent years.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t think Jessa and Ben are happy together. I just have this gut feeling. I believe they are miserable,&#8221; one person opined on the r/DuggarsSnark subreddit, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/8319586/jessa-duggars-fans-fear-miserable-in-marriage-ben-seewald/">according to</a> UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember when Jessa posted online (idk if she erased it). Her messy house. And how her kids are always messing it up. And idk it just made me feel that she is not truly happy,&#8221; this person continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you [guys] think? Do you believe she and Ben are not happy in their marriage?&#8221; another poster poised to the group</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely not. Jessa, I think was the &#8216;prize&#8217; in her community. I think she expected to also marry a &#8216;prize,'&#8221; one redditor replied, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;He is effectively, another child for her to take care of. Granted I think she likes being able to control him. [Ben] won’t step up and she’ll keep treating him the way she does.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jessa-and-ben-now-the-parent-trap">Jessa and Ben Now: The Parent Trap?</h2>



<p>The truth is, Jessa and Ben are still together, and more than that, they&#8217;ve just expanded their family.</p>

<p>The pair welcomed George Augustine Seewald on December 19th, 2023. This is their 5th child together, after already welcoming kids Spurgeon, Henry, Ivy, and Fern.</p>



<p>So, if they are unhappy, are they perhaps sticking it out for the kids? It surely would be a huge disruption to their lives if they jumped ship. </p>



<p>But again, commenters suggest that had these two had a normal dating life before getting together, things would&#8217;ve been very different. <br></p>



<p>&#8220;If Jessa had been allowed to date him, screw around, and then come to the realization that &#8216;Yeah, he’s kinda hot…but what a f**king moron.&#8217; She probably never would’ve married him and met someone who was actually compatible,&#8221; one person wrote on the thread. </p>



<p>Still, at least one person found a silver lining in the discord:</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see much love in their relationship but Jessa is safe and has complete freedom which is a lot more than most wives in these communities.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-jessa-duggar-still-in-iblp">Is Jessa Duggar Still In <strong>IBLP</strong>? </h2>



<p>But if by &#8220;community&#8221; they mean the IBLP &#8212; aka, the nondenominational Christian fundamentalist organization Institute in Basic Life Principles &#8211; then they need to get up with the times.</p>



<p>Jessa revealed that she, Ben, and their children “do not” belong to IBLP in a September 2023 Instagram Story Q&amp;A. </p>



<p>Furthermore, Ben currently serves as a pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in Arkansas.</p>



<p>But despite not being part of the &#8220;community&#8221; anymore, Jessa is one of the kids still very much involved with her parents. On Mother&#8217;s Day 2024, she even wrote a heartwarming message to her mother, Michelle Duggar, to honor how &#8220;blessed&#8221; she was.</p>



<p>So, if the rumors are true and another season of their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/the-duggars-to-be-exposed-again-on-shiny-happy-people-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reality show</a> is finally in the works, we bet you&#8217;ll see Jessa on the show. But Ben? Eh, only time will tell. </p>

<p>The term &#8220;Duggar divorce&#8221; is an oxymoron.</p>



<p>If you know anything about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/jim-bob-duggar-all-the-wild-beliefs-and-shocking-scandals-of-reality-tvs-most-controversial-father/">Jim Bob Duggar&#8217;s belief system</a>, you know that the man is very big on marriage and procreation.</p>



<p>In Jim Bob&#8217;s view, women were put on earth solely for the purposes of birthing children and becoming dutiful wives.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the man believes that divorce is a mortal sin, and that any married people who don&#8217;t stay married should be shunned by polite society.</p>



<p>So it would take a lot for one of Jim Bob&#8217;s kids to pull the plug on their marriage &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will never happen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-duggar-divorces-who-might-be-the-first-to-go">Duggar Divorces: Who Might Be the First to Go?</h2>



<p>During a recent discussion on the always-entertaining r/DuggarsSnark subreddit, commenters speculated about which couples might openly defy Jim Bob by going their separate ways.</p>



<p>And the consensus was that Duggar World is home to two marriages that appear to be doomed.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think when Jim Bob dies, there will be a few divorces,&#8221; one user wrote, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/8702176/duggar-fans-predict-couples-divorce-jim-bob-rules/">according to</a> UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like there’s a chance that when Josh gets out, after waiting for him for all these years Anna will get tossed aside,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Josh] and Anna would be my only guess tbh. [Josh] would be the one to initiate the divorce when he gets out of prison and doesn’t feel like pretending to be a good IBLP man anymore,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-josh-duggar-get-dumped">Could Josh Duggar Get Dumped?</h2>



<p>Yes, Josh and Anna are certainly the most troubled couple in the family.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="767" height="466" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar.jpg" alt="Now-disgraced criminal Josh Duggar sits beside wife Anna Duggar on 19 Kids and Counting." class="wp-image-460917" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar.jpg 767w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar-300x182.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar-735x447.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar-335x204.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar-347x211.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar-520x316.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/anna-and-josh-duggar-640x389.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Now-disgraced criminal Josh Duggar sits beside wife Anna Duggar on 19 Kids and Counting.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/josh-duggar-rejected-by-the-supreme-court-to-remain-behind-bars-for-a-very-long-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh&#8217;s latest appeal was rejected</a>. And that means he won&#8217;t get out of prison for nearly a decade. So we&#8217;ll probably have to wait quite a few years to see if those predictions come true.</p>



<p>But some Duggar-watchers think a different Duggat divorce will happen much sooner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-jessa-and-ben-call-it-quits">Could Jessa and Ben Call It Quits?</h2>



<p>&#8220;I think it’s going to be Jessa and Ben as well. I definitely do not see any love (not even like) between them,&#8221; one Reddit user predicted.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="635" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-1024x635.webp" alt="Jessa Duggar throwback photo" class="wp-image-483328" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-1024x635.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-300x186.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-768x476.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-735x456.webp 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-335x208.webp 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-347x215.webp 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-520x322.webp 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-640x397.webp 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-960x595.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1-1080x670.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Jessa-Seewald-1.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessa Duggar is featured here in a clip from TLC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I can see Jessa dumping Ben and going for a stronger man,&#8221; another wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope Jessa leaves Ben. She was my favorite when I used to watch the show and I always figured she would be there 1st to break all the rules when she turned 18,&#8221; a third commented, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;I think she’ll find herself when her kids are older.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jessa-s-alleged-misery">Jessa&#8217;s Alleged Misery</h2>



<p>Yes, a vocal contingent of Duggar fans have spent rooting for<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/jessa-duggar-answers-to-all-of-your-questions-about-jim-bobs-favorite-daughter/"> Jessa to free herself</a> from the constraints of the hyper-patriarchal world in which she was raised.</p>



<p>They believe that as a husband who was essentially hand-picked by Jessa&#8217;s father, Ben is the embodiment of that oppression.</p>



<p>He might not be as bad as these people have made him out to be. But Jessa would definitely need to leave her marriage in order to liberate herself from her father&#8217;s belief system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jessa-duggar-heres-why-fans-think-shes-miserable-in-her-marriage-to-ben-seewald/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessa&#8217;s miserable marriage</a> has been a topic of speculation since the moment she said &#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, now there are rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jesse-duggar-pregnant-again-the-reality-star-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessa is pregnant</a> yet again. So we guess Reddit can&#8217;t make up its mind.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, Jim Bob and Michelle have 19 children, and most of them will likely follow in their parents&#8217; footsteps by marrying very young.</p>



<p>Statistically, that means that the family will see at least one divorce in the years to come.</p>



<p>And you can be sure Jim Bob will flip his lid if and when it happens!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Jessa Duggar just <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/07/jessa-duggar-welcomes-baby-number-4-shares-intimate-birth-photos/">welcomed her fourth child</a> in 2021.</p>



<p>Most moms in her position would probably be thinking about retiring their uteruses, or at least waiting a long time before popping out another one.</p>



<p>But Jessa is a Duggar, which means she was raised to believe that procreation is her primary reason for being.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that fans are convinced Jessa is currently pregnant with baby number five!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>To be clear, Jessa has not made any sort of announcement to that effect.</p>



<p>Still, some fans are certain that she&#8217;s secretly expecting.</p>



<p>The main cause of the speculation is the fact that Jessa hasn&#8217;t posted any new photos on her Instagram page since November.</p>



<p>Yes, that would be a long absence from social media under any circumstances, but it&#8217;s particularly suspicious in this case, as Jessa abstained from posting through the entire holiday season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessa shows off her family. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>On Reddit and elsewhere, Jessa&#8217;s followers made note of the absence, and many concluded that there&#8217;s only a handful of possible explanations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jessa’s continued absence on social media &#8211; Her last post was November 21. She missed Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years. Is she just taking a break?&#8221; one person asked, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/7128389/duggar-fans-suspect-jessa-pregnant-fifth-child-clue/">according to</a> UK tabloid<em> The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m wondering if she WAS pregnant. I feel like the last time she was this MIA was when she miscarried after (?) Ivy? There was that whole bee-themed photo shoot she never posted photos of,&#8221; another speculated.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking she&#8217;s pregnant like others have said. Hopefully she will announce soon, I want to know what name she&#8217;ll come up with this time,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessa and Ben in a sponsored content post. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That seems to be the consensus theory, but some folks still aren&#8217;t buying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not disagreeing with you, but I just don’t see why pregnancy would be a reason to stop posting,&#8221; one person commented.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why miss out on sponsorship opportunities etc for months just for the sake of keeping a fifth pregnancy a secret?&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Pregnancy maybe but could her and Ben be going through marital issues especially stemming from Jinger&#8217;s book. Plus maybe Ben&#8217;s church has said something too about her social media,&#8221; another person guessed.</p>

<p>Yes, Jessa and husband Ben Seewald might soon find themselves at the center of a strange controversy thanks to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/jessa-duggar-heres-why-fans-think-shes-no-longer-speaking-to-her-family/">Jinger Duggar&#8217;s memoir</a>, which is set for release at the end of this month.</p>



<p> In the book, Jinger details a spiritual awakening that she experienced after attending services at Ben&#8217;s church.</p>



<p>The experience led her in a new direction which caused some theological disagreements with Jinger&#8217;s famously fundamentalist parents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png" alt="Jessa Duggar on Video" class="wp-image-416289" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png 678w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-300x239.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-335x267.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-347x276.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-520x414.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-640x510.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessa Duggar looks into the camera in this still from a 2020 video and talks about her mental health.

<p></p>



<p>So it could be that Jessa is steering clear of the internet simply because she doesn&#8217;t want to answer any difficult questions in the run-up to Jinger&#8217;s release date.</p>



<p>Of course, Duggar women have also held off on announcing their pregnancies in the years since the Josh Duggar sex scandals.</p>



<p>No one&#8217;s sure why that became the new family policy, but it&#8217;s possible that Jessa is keeping a low profile in order to follow suit.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, fans will surely continue to speculate about Jessa&#8217;s social media absence until such time as she chooses to make her long-awaited return!</p>

<p>Jessa Duggar has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most quiet, unassuming members of her family.</p>



<p>As one scandal after another engulfed her loved ones in recent years, Jessa has mostly steered clear of the controversies.</p>



<p>And for most of that time, she also managed to remain on decent terms with her ultra-conservative parents.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/06/jill-duggar-fans-think-shes-changed-her-voice-demeanor-values-si/">Jill Duggar cut ties with her parents</a>, and Amy Duggar spoke out against the culture of abuse that her uncle has fostered for so long, Jessa continued to play the part of the dutiful daughter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png" alt="Jessa Duggar on Video" class="wp-image-416289" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png 678w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-300x239.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-335x267.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-347x276.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-520x414.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-640x510.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessa Duggar looks into the camera in this still from a YouTube video and talks about her mental health. (Photo via YouTube)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But now fans suspect that Jessa&#8217;s relationship with her parents may have hit a rough patch.</p>



<p>In fact, some fans believe that Jessa has become the latest Duggar child to cut off contact with her folks.</p>



<p>And remarkably, the rift that allegedly drove the two parties apart has nothing to do with the Josh Duggar child pornography scandal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Josh&#8217;s arrest marked the beginning of the end of the Duggar&#8217;s media empire. </figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Instead, it has to do with the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/jinger-duggar-previews-upcoming-memoir-im-ready-to-expose-all-the-lies/">Jinger Duggar&#8217;s forthcoming memoir</a>, which is set for release in January.</p>



<p>Yes, Jinger is about to make her literary debut with a book entitled <em>Becoming Free Indeed</em>.</p>



<p>The title refers to the so-called Free Jinger movement that exploded on social media during Jinger&#8217;s teen years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="686" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-686x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-461820" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-686x1024.png 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-201x300.png 201w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-768x1146.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-735x1097.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-224x335.png 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-233x347.png 233w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-348x520.png 348w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-429x640.png 429w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-515x768.png 515w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-643x960.png 643w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM-724x1080.png 724w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-1.22.43-PM.png 792w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jinger Duggar is preparing to release a new memoir. And fans are anxious to see how her family will react. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Insiders say Jinger&#8217;s parents are worried about the book, as they&#8217;re concerned about possible damage to their reputation.</p>



<p>And apparently, those fears have not been assuaged by the news that the book will focus on Jinger&#8217;s religious beliefs and not the recent controversies surrounding her family.</p>



<p>At one point in the book, Jinger opens up about realizing that she no longer believed in some of the teachings she had grown up with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jinger Duggar smiles very broadly in this sweet photo of the former reality star. (Photo via Instagram_</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I realized that some of what I had been taught was hurtful and untrue,” Jinger writes.</p>



<p>“I knew I needed to speak publicly about this because I promoted teachings that I now believe are damaging.”</p>



<p>Then Jinger throws fans a curveball by revealing that it was Jessa&#8217;s husband, Ben Seewald, who helped her to arrive at her new belief system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald on an episode of TLC&#8217;s now-defunct Counting On. (Photo via TLC)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I noticed his church read the Bible in its entirety and preached scripture that way,&#8221; Jinger said of the mentoring that she received from her brother-in-law.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like now I’m in a much better place. I see God as amazing.”</p>



<p>Yes, Ben grew up in a spiritual tradition that differs from the Duggars&#8217; in a number of important ways.</p>



<p>So what does all of this have to do with Jessa&#8217;s relationship with her parents?</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Well, fans have noticed that Jessa appears to have distanced herself from her parents in recent years.</p>



<p>At first, it was widely believed that Jessa had angered her parents by siding with Jill, but now, a new theory has emerged:</p>



<p>Many suspect that Jim Bob and Michelle were willing to turn a blind eye to the Seewalds&#8217; beliefs as long as the theological rift was kept private.</p>

<p>But now, Jinger is about to expose the latest conflict among the Duggars, and Jim Bob believes it&#8217;s all Ben and Jessa&#8217;s fault.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just the latest in a long, long line of bizarre controversies involving TV&#8217;s most effed-up family of fundies!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>In recent months, Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald have been much more open about their relationship than most Duggar couples.</p>



<p>Pretending that they exist in a state of non-stop marital bliss is usually a part of the family&#8217;s self-promotion campaign.</p>



<p>But Jessa and Ben have broken with tradition (and years of brainwashing) by speaking publicly about the problems they&#8217;ve encountered over the course of their relationship.</p>



<p>In a surprisingly candid post from September, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/jessa-duggar-sparks-divorce-rumors-ive-been-a-thoughtless-wife/">Jessa admitted to being a thoughtless wife</a> to Ben.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa and Ben in a sponsored content post. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The confession led fans to conclude that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/jessa-duggar-ben-seewald-heres-why-fans-think-theyre-headed-for-divorce/">Jessa and Ben are headed for divorce</a>.</p>



<p>Now, however, a pair of relationship experts have assured all those concerned observers that the Seewalds will be just fine.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these experts are astrologists, so their opinion really doesn&#8217;t count for a whole lot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa Seewald, Ben Seewald and their kids Spurgeon, Henry and Ivy. Easter 2020. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;As opposite signs, Jessa and Ben’s relationship is marked by dynamic tension – and it’s hardly a secret!&#8221; <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/6435100/jessa-duggar-ben-seewald-marriage-problems-astrology/">a podcasting team</a> called the Astro Twins told UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em> this week.</p>



<p>&#8220;An intense Scorpio, Jessa is astrologically wired to want control, and it seems she has established her domain. But at what cost?&#8221; the duo continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;She married a Bull, the astrological sign that has two speeds: on and off. The Taurus man is deceptively simple, and does best when he has his own domain to manage HIS way.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa Duggar recently admitted to trouble in her marriage to Ben Seewald. Are these two on the rocks? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The AstroTwins suggested that this might be why Ben has been accused of not pulling his weight in the relationship.</p>



<p>&#8220;The problem here? Methodical Taurus moves at a much slower speed than Scorpio, which can aggravate Jessa’s cosmic control issues,&#8221; say the Twins.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben has been accused of being lazy and letting his wife do all the heavy lifting, which may not be untrue.</p>



<p>&#8220;As a result, she may be over-functioning (to wit: packing up the entire house and moving them while he was at work!) and he’s under-functioning, a tricky dance they seem to be stuck in.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, Jessa really did pack up the entire house and move without Ben&#8217;s help, which many took as a sign of trouble within the relationship.</p>



<p>But the AstroTwins say hope is not lost.</p>



<p>&#8220;If they can start to address these issues head-on rather than indirectly or passive-aggressively (as they’re doing now), this couple can turn things around,&#8221; they report.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Ben Seewald just got a haircut from his wife. What do you think, folks?!? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;In March 2023, Ben will begin his Saturn return, a 2.5-year period of maturity when people get their act together and start adulting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jessa, who’s two years older than him, is already going through her Saturn return now,&#8221; the Twins explain.</p>



<p>&#8220;They’re at two very different levels of maturity and development. If they can make it through this transitional and tumultuous time, they will reach a common level in a couple of years.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ben and Jessa Seewald on TLC, in a scene from their reality show Counting On.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>So there you have it.</p>



<p>The difference in Ben and Jessa&#8217;s maturity levels can apparently be explained by astrology.</p>



<p>But because the Duggars are raised to believe that astrology is an invention of the devil, the couple probably won&#8217;t be very interested in the AstroTwins&#8217; advice!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Until recently, Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald&#8217;s relationship seemed to be pretty devoid of drama.</p>



<p>Even before the entire Duggar clan was scandalized by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/anna-duggar-says-theres-more-to-the-story-of-her-creepy-husband/">Josh&#8217;s conviction on child pornography charges</a>, Jessa and Ben seemed far less interested in the spotlight than most of her family.</p>



<p>But earlier this month, Jessa shocked fans with a candid confession about her marriage.</p>



<p>Despite appearances to the contrary, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/jessa-duggar-sparks-divorce-rumors-ive-been-a-thoughtless-wife/">Jessa claimed that she&#8217;d been a &#8220;thoughtless&#8221;</a> wife to Ben.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa and Ben in a sponsored content post. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>She sparked further concern by indicating that the inconsiderate behavior goes in both directions and that &#8220;offenses inevitably happen&#8221; in the Seewald household.</p>



<p>&#8220;No marriage is perfect. At times, we step on each other&#8217;s toes. Sometimes we fail to communicate our plans and our goals, or we overbook and run ourselves ragged,&#8221; Jessa wrote on Instagram, along with the below photo of Ben cooking.</p>



<p>(Even the photo selection sparked controversy, as Duggar men rarely help out in the kitchen.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa Duggar recently admitted to trouble in her marriage to Ben Seewald. Are these two on the rocks? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p> &#8220;We have differing opinions, and we have to talk through things and work them out. We speak hastily and have to repent of our thoughtlessness,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s worth noting that Jessa also sang Ben&#8217;s praises in the post.</p>



<p>&#8220;I married up in every way, and I’m not ashamed to admit it!&#8221; she wrote, adding:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png" alt="Jessa Duggar on Video" class="wp-image-416289" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png 678w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-300x239.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-335x267.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-347x276.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-520x414.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-640x510.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption>Jessa Duggar looks into the camera in this still from a 2020 video and talks about her mental health. (Photo via YouTube)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Ben daily models to me this Christlike love.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s probably the highest compliment that a Duggar woman can pay to her husband.</p>



<p>Even so, Jessa&#8217;s post continues to draw attention from concerned fans, many of whom have taken to the comments to express their fears.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Jessa shows off her family. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Some marriages, depending on the individual personalities, are more difficult than others, causing daily frustration and mental fatigue,&#8221; one person wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;It requires a tremendous amount of will and energy to forgive, to be patient, to be loving, and to be quiet in some instances.&#8221;</p>



<p>There were many comments of that nature, with a surprising amount of fans opening up about rough patches that they&#8217;ve experienced in their own marriages.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ben and Jessa Seewald on TLC, in a scene from their reality show Counting On.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Jessa is happy to have provided her fans with a safe space to discuss their own relationship woes.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s important to bear in mind that Jessa emphasized that her marriage is mostly very happy.</p>



<p>Other commenters were interested in another matter entirely, with several asking for clarification on the question of whether or not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/jessa-duggar-finally-responds-to-rumors-that-shes-pregnant-with-baby-5/">Jessa is pregnant with her fifth child</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>That&#8217;s what Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald are rumored to be expecting a fifth child. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jessa offered a simple &#8220;no&#8221; in response to one such inquiry.</p>



<p>So we guess it&#8217;s safe to say that Jessa and Ben are not expecting a fifth kid anytime soon.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also safe to assume that the couple won&#8217;t be going their separate ways anytime soon.</p>



<p>After all, divorce is strictly forbidden in the Duggars&#8217; community, and Jessa still sticks pretty close to the rules set out by her parents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Back in 2014, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/11/jessa-duggar-and-ben-seewald-married/">Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald got married</a> in one of the big, lavish weddings that Jim Bob used to enjoy throwing so much.</p>



<p>In the years since, the couple has mostly kept a low profile, especially in the months since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/josh-duggar-conviction-has-he-finally-destroyed-the-duggar-media/">Josh Duggar was convicted on child pornography charges</a>.</p>



<p>(The scandal didn&#8217;t involve Jessa and Ben directly, but most of the Duggars have been steering clear of the spotlight more than usual since the verdict.)</p>



<p>But despite the fact that Jessa and Ben have been carefully guarding their privacy, fans believe their relationship has been showing obvious signs of strain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ben and Jessa Seewald on TLC, in a scene from their reality show Counting On.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In fact, some have gone so far as to suggest that the Seewalds might be considering ending their marriage.</p>



<p>The speculation began when fans noticed that photos of Ben are few and far between on Jessa&#8217;s Instagram page.</p>



<p>The mother of four tried to rectify this with a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/jessa-duggar-sparks-divorce-rumors-ive-been-a-thoughtless-wife/">post dedicated to her husband</a>, but she wound up just making matters worse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa Duggar recently admitted to trouble in her marriage to Ben Seewald. Are these two on the rocks? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes we fail to communicate our plans and our goals, or we overbook and run ourselves ragged. We have differing opinions, and we have to talk through things and work them out,&#8221; Jessa captioned the photo above. </p>



<p>&#8220;We speak hastily and have to repent of our thoughtlessness. Offenses inevitably happen,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>&#8220;How we deal with them, and how we respond to one another, makes all the difference in whether our relationship thrives or dies.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa and Ben in happier times. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Jessa tempered her criticism by joking that she &#8220;married up,&#8221; but many fans weren&#8217;t buying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t think Ben and Jessa are in a happy loving relationship, just doing what they have to, knowing that they can’t ever get a divorce,&#8221; one person commented on the r/DugarsSnark subreddit.</p>



<p> &#8220;I would guess their marriage is in its dying throes based on the &#8216;I married up&#8217; post she made the other day. She’s really trying to convince herself,&#8221; another added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Surprise House Move While Hubby Was at Work!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8aMaPR7mQ0?start=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Others pointed to an unusual video Jessa posted recently in which she moved her family to a new house without Ben&#8217;s knowledge.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben is working today, but I didn&#8217;t have anything going on and I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Well, the house is finished,'&#8221; Jessa said on YouTube. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think it would be an awesome surprise if we went ahead and packed everything up and moved over to the house. And he just, like, shows up over there and we&#8217;re moved in.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ben Seewald seems confused in this clip screenshot from a video Jessa posted. (Photo via YouTube)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, fans were unimpressed by Jessa&#8217;s grand gesture.</p>



<p>&#8220;This seemed like Jessa didn’t want any of Ben’s input or interference with the move so she spun it as a &#8216;surprise,'&#8221; one person wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;Surprises should be, &#8216;I made dinner for you!&#8217; not, &#8216;I moved into a new house while you (preached?????)!&#8217; There&#8217;s a difference … It&#8217;s scary how well she did that move if Ben was honestly surprised,&#8221; another chimed in.</p>



<p>The clip led to more divorce speculation, but as one commenter pointed out, it seems unlikely that these two will ever call it quits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa Seewald, Ben Seewald and their kids Spurgeon, Henry and Ivy. Easter 2020. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;There is ZERO chance of these two getting divorced any time soon. They are both fundie Christians with similar values and mindset,&#8221; this Redditor wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;As long as Ben lets her call the shots and stays out of her way, she&#8217;s good. She has everything she ever wanted out of life right now,&#8221; they continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;BTW, the &#8216;new&#8217; house they poured so much $ into belongs to a church. They get divorced or even separate, bye bye house.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald are rumored to be going through tough times. (Photo via TLC)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, even if Ben and Jessa wanted to get divorced, the logistics of doing so would likely prevent them from ever even trying.</p>



<p>Both parties would face rejection from their families and their community if they ever even suggested such a solution.</p>



<p>So if the rumors of Jessa&#8217;s unhappiness are true, sadly, it seems that she&#8217;ll be forced to suffer in silence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Jessa Duggar rarely speaks about her marriage.</p>



<p>And when she does, it&#8217;s the usual Duggar drivel about how her husband leads and she follows, and being a subservient wife is her favorite thing in the world after going to church.</p>



<p>But from time to time, Jessa speaks candidly and admits that her life is not as hunky-dory as it seems.</p>



<p>And her latest confession had to do with recent rough patches in her relationship with husband Ben Seewald.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa and Ben in a sponsored content post. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Earlier this week, Jessa posted a photo of Ben cooking (below), and fans expected the usual Duggar ode to the quiet joys of domestic life.</p>



<p>And indeed, things started out that way, as Jessa observed that she &#8220;married up in every way.&#8221;</p>



<p>From there, however, Jessa threw us a curveball and admitted that while Ben was making pizza, she was contemplating the many ways in their marriage had gone wrong.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jessa Duggar recently admitted to trouble in her marriage to Ben Seewald. Are these two on the rocks? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We have differing opinions, and we have to talk through things and work them out,&#8221; Jessa informed her followers.</p>



<p>&#8220;We speak hastily and have to repent of our thoughtlessness. Offenses inevitably happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>For a second there, it sounded like Jessa was building up to making some sort of serious announcement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png" alt="Jessa Duggar on Video" class="wp-image-416289" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png 678w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-300x239.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-335x267.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-347x276.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-520x414.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-640x510.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption>Jessa Duggar looks into the camera in this still from a YouTube video and talks about her mental health. (Photo via YouTube)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But at the end of the post, she veered back into familiar Duggar territory,</p>



<p>&#8220;How we deal with them, and how we respond to one another, makes all the difference in whether our relationship thrives or dies,&#8221; Jessa observed.</p>



<p>Yes, in the end, it was just more boring, boilerplate marital advice from a Duggar who thinks she&#8217;s an expert on just about everything (as they all do).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Jessa Duggar wears sandals with socks, poses with her family. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some fans who didn&#8217;t read closely walked away with the impression that Jessa and Ben&#8217;s relationship was in serious trouble.</p>



<p>But we think the bits about not getting along with her husband were merely offered up so that her advice to married couples wouldn&#8217;t sound so boastful.</p>



<p>For the most part, fans praised Jessa for being so &#8220;truthful&#8221; and acted like she&#8217;d just offered some sort of profound insight into the state of modern marriage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>That&#8217;s what Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald posing with yet another sonogram photo! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Some marriages, depending on the individual personalities, are more difficult than others, causing daily frustration and mental fatigue,&#8221; wrote one such commenter, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/6179520/jessa-duggar-divorce-rumors-admits-offenses-marriage-ben-seewald/">according to</a> UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;It requires a tremendous amount of will and energy to forgive, to be patient, to be loving, and to be quiet in some instances.&#8221;</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/jessa-duggar-finally-responds-to-rumors-that-shes-pregnant-with-baby-5/">Jessa is rumored to be pregnant with her fifth child</a>, but there&#8217;s been no confirmation or denial on her part.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Jessa shows off her family. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Regardless of whether or not she&#8217;s currently knocked up, Jessa probably will welcome at least one more kid at some point.</p>



<p>In the meantime, she&#8217;ll probably continue to offer unsolicited advice to her Instagram followers.</p>



<p>It seems that with her reality TV career at an end, Jessa has set her sights on becoming a sort of fundie Oprah.</p>



<p>And who knows &#8212; it might work out for her!</p>

<p>There was a time when Jim Bob Duggar ruled over his children with an iron fist.</p>



<p>For decades, Jim Bob&#8217;s word was law, and no one dared question his authority.</p>



<p>But those days are long gone.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/bobye-holt-jim-bob-duggar-knew-that-josh-was-molesting-his-sisters-and-still-let-him-babysit/">Josh Duggar sex scandals</a> led several of Jim Bob&#8217;s kids to question his wisdom, and a few have started openly disregarding the strict rules with which they were raised.</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="626" height="640" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/jim-bob-duggar-confessional-photo.jpg" alt="Jim Bob Duggar Confessional Photo" class="wp-image-411196" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/jim-bob-duggar-confessional-photo.jpg 626w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/jim-bob-duggar-confessional-photo-293x300.jpg 293w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/jim-bob-duggar-confessional-photo-328x335.jpg 328w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/jim-bob-duggar-confessional-photo-339x347.jpg 339w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/jim-bob-duggar-confessional-photo-509x520.jpg 509w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><figcaption>(TLC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nowadays,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/jeremy-vuolo-jim-bob-duggar-hates-that-jinger-wears-pants/"> Jinger Duggar wears pants</a> in defiance of the infamous Duggar dress code.</p>



<p>Not to be outdone, rebellious <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/09/jill-duggar-drinks-alcohol-sends-ultimate-eff-you-to-parents/">Jill Duggar started drinking alcohol</a>.</p>



<p>This was an even bigger deal than Jinger&#8217;s decision to purchase a forbidden pair of Levi&#8217;s.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Jim Bob doesn&#8217;t drink, and insiders say he teaches his children that booze is an invention of the devil.</p>



<p>But Jill cut ties with her parents years ago, so JB probably wasn&#8217;t too shocked when she posted pics in which she and her husband, Derick Dillard, could be seen hoisting a few cocktails.</p>



<p>However, Jill&#8217;s younger sister Jessa Duggar has remained loyal to her parents throughout the family&#8217;s many scandals.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>So you can imagine Jim Bob&#8217;s surprise when photos surfaced that appeared to show Jessa enjoying a drink with her husband, Ben Seewald.</p>



<p>The image below has generated some intense debate in the Duggar-focused corners of social media.</p>



<p>The pic was originally posted by Jessa, and it appears to show Ben enjoying an adult beverage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But is the scene more innocent than it appears?</p>



<p>Duggar watchers are divided.</p>



<p>&#8220;Someone put this on an FB group and asked if Ben is drinking alcohol? Personally I bet it&#8217;s a virgin drink but what do y&#8217;all think?&#8221; one person asked on Reddit.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Very much doubt it&#8217;s alcoholic. Ben is way too into the koolaid to drink publicly like that,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I guess I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he drinks occasionally, but it would be hidden in his own kitchen after the kids are in bed if anything,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen two of his sisters with beers before. Maybe? But yeah I&#8217;m still leaning toward non alcoholic,&#8221; a fourth observed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Judging by the little hands reaching for it, and his lack of concern, it’s probably just a big glass of Orange juice,&#8221; a fifth pointed out.</p>



<p>Yes, the most likely explanation here is that Ben was enjoying some sort of booze-free mocktail.</p>



<p>Of all the Duggar sons-in-law, few are as committed to the family&#8217;s defiantly old-school belief system as Ben.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Still, it&#8217;s interesting that Jessa and Ben would post a pic like that and not clarify that Ben&#8217;s beverage contained no alcohol.</p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s a sign that they&#8217;re not as worried about keeping up appearances as they used to be.</p>



<p>Or as Jim Bob would like them to be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Yes, we doubt that Ben and Jessa have gone so far as to start guzzling hooch in public with no concern for who sees them.</p>



<p>But it seems obvious that they&#8217;re not as worried about Jim Bob&#8217;s approval as they once were.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re sure that the Duggar patriarch can feel the balance of power shifting within his own family.</p>

<p>Is she really happy in her marriage. Can she ever be happy living a life that she didn&#8217;t really choose for herself?</p>
<p>These worries date back to a time before <a href="/videos/jim-bob-duggar-shows-jessa-how-to-kiss-in-stomach-turning-throwb/">Jessa learned how to kiss</a> from her parents, when she had her own thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>Fans don&#8217;t have to guess how Jessa&#8217;s parents molded her to please her then-future husband. They saw it themselves on TV.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jessa and Ben have been married for eight years.</p>
<p>However, a <em>19 Kids &amp; Counting</em> clip has been making the rounds &#8212; one that showed Jessa getting advice from the worst person to ask: her mother.</p>
<p>At the time, Jessa was simply in a courtship with Ben, but she wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of him and turned to Michelle for help.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png" alt="Jessa Duggar on Video" class="wp-image-416289" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video.png 678w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-300x239.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-335x267.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-347x276.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-520x414.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/jessa-duggar-on-video-640x510.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption>(YouTube)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I am in a courtship with a wonderful man named Ben Seewald, and we&#8217;ve been courting for about four months now,&quot; Jessa explained to the camera.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been good. I&#8217;m missing him, though,&quot; viewers saw her tell Michelle.</p>
<p>&quot;So he&#8217;s like super-emotional like a feeling kind of person and I&#8217;m really not, you know that,&quot; Jessa explained to Mommy Dearest.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="880" height="513" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar.png" alt="Jesse Duggar, Michelle Duggar, and Jim Bob Duggar" class="wp-image-345377" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar.png 880w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-300x175.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-768x448.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-735x428.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-335x195.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-347x202.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-520x303.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/jesse-duggar-michelle-duggar-and-jim-bob-duggar-640x373.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(YouTube)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;m kind of just like, cut and dry,&quot; Jessa noted.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she detailed, &quot;so he&#8217;s always texting me like the sweetest things. &quot;He&#8217;s like &#8216;If I had all the flowers in the world, all the rose gardens in the world I&#8217;d give them all to you.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>Jessa very humorously continued: &quot;And I&#8217;m like &#8216;Uh, where would I put em?&#8217;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, this is when Michelle &#8212; the product of decades of cult brainwashing &#8212; offered her version of relationship advice.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though I know that typically you just are real, you know, plain and simple about things, you probably should say something like &#8216;Oh Ben, that is so sweet, oh thank you!&#8217;&quot; she suggested.</p>
<p>Michelle continued: &quot;However he expresses love is probably the way that he receives it as well.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;And on your part, you probably will practice learning how to express that love language that he needs to hear from you to him,&quot; Michelle advised.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she admitted, &quot;it&#8217;s a learning process.&quot;</p>
<p>While learning to communicate is important, that sounded incredibly one-sided &#8230; and that&#8217;s what social media users are saying, too.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;This is gross,&quot; commented a redditor after <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/v1evum/jessa_gets_coaching_in_keeping_sweet_from_meech/">the clip</a> circulated. &quot;They act like Jessa has some kind of defect.&quot;</p>
<p>The commenter continued: &quot;There is nothing wrong with being direct and not demonstrative.&quot;</p>
<p>Sagely, the redditor observed: &quot;This is why these people need to stop marrying the first person they meet.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;They needed time to find out if their personalities complemented each other or not,&quot; the commenter reasoned.</p>
<p>&quot;If Ben needed someone to reciprocate his romantic personality,&quot; the Reddit comment went on, &quot;he deserved that.&quot;</p>
<p>They continued: &quot;If Jessa can&#8217;t do that for him, she deserved someone who fit her better too.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She would&rsquo;ve had much more fun with someone who also had a dry sense of humor and could push her, intellectually I mean,&quot; a second redditor explained.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t mean someone mean and sarcastic,&quot; the comment clarified, &quot;but just someone who would get her.&quot;</p>
<p>The commenter observed: &quot;I think she&rsquo;s lost a lot of herself in marriage.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She could have been more tactful in her response, but yeah, this was clearly a sign that they were not a good match,&quot; a third chimed in.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s sad that they encouraged her to double down and change her personality,&quot; the redditor lamented, &quot;rather than end the courtship.&quot;</p>
<p>Another agreed: &quot;I think it&rsquo;s sick. Michelle&rsquo;s response is gross. Others is not as gross, but close. Frightening how people think girls should be raised.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Sooooo&#8230;.how come it&#8217;s all on her to learn his love language,&quot; asked another.</p>
<p>&quot;Why does she have to give and receive in HIS preferred way?&quot; the commenter pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;Why isn&#8217;t she being encouraged to give in his love language and communicate her own so he can learn to give love to her in HER preferred way???Grrrrrrrr,&quot; another expressed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="720" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on.jpg" alt="Jessa on Counting On" class="wp-image-412295" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-480x480.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-320x320.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-200x200.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-335x335.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-347x347.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-520x520.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/jessa-on-counting-on-640x640.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption>([&amp;quot;CopyrightNotice&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Credit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rights&amp;quot;])</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;They think that Jessa having her own romantic style is some sort of bad thing when that is not the case,&quot; another stated.</p>
<p>That more or less summarizes the Duggar cult&#8217;s beliefs: women must warp themselves to ideally suit their husbands, not just sexually but in personality.</p>
<p>To them, Jessa&#8217;s literal-minded wit was a personality flaw because it was a sign of independent personhood, rather than something molded to please the man who is now her husband.</p>
