<p>Aaron Carter passed away in 2022. His young son is now 3 years old.</p>



<p>Prince Carter just made his red carpet debut.</p>



<p>This bittersweet occasion involves a new documentary following his family&#8217;s tragedies.</p>



<p>He also looks like a precious mini-me. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-carter-stepped-out-on-the-red-carpet">Prince Carter stepped out on the red carpet</h2>



<p>On Wednesday, April 9, 3-year-old Princeton Lyrik Carter made his red carpet debut.</p>



<p>The precious child, son of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/aaron-carter-fiancee-melanie-martin-where-is-she-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanie Martin</a> and the late Aaron Carter, appeared with his mother and other family.</p>



<p>This was not just any red carpet event. This was a screening of <em>The Carters: Hurts To Love You</em>, which delves into the toll that fame exacted upon this famous family. This impacted Aaron at a particularly young age.</p>

<p>Prince truly looks like he&#8217;s living up to his name. He looked very much like a fancy little man in a black leather jacket. </p>



<p>And did you peep those Batman sneakers? <em>Adorable</em>.</p>



<p>Prince was just shy of one year old at the time of Aaron&#8217;s tragic death. </p>



<p>It is conceivable that he has faint memories of his departed father, but Aaron Carter is likely more of an <em>idea</em> to him than anything else. </p>



<p>This sensation is unlikely to fade as he grows up in his late father&#8217;s shadow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-was-a-precious-albeit-bittersweet-moment">This was a precious, albeit bittersweet moment</h2>



<p>To his credit, Prince seemed totally relaxed in his mother&#8217;s arms, even as countless cameras snapped photos of him.</p>



<p>Others on the red carpet were more familiar with the limelight, including David Arquette and Tori Spelling.</p>



<p>And, of course, Angel Carter Conrad &#8212; Aaron&#8217;s twin sister &#8212; was there.</p>



<p> She even posed with her little nephew.</p>

<p>On November 5, 2022, Aaron Carter was found dead at home. He was only 34 years old.</p>



<p>The singer had been worrying fans for years with various red flags, behavioral incidents, legal troubles, and actions that appeared to be cries for help.</p>



<p>He had died from drowning. The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed-horrible-and-tragic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical examiner</a> ruled that his tragic death was an accident, one following use of alprazolam and a flammable gas, difluoroethane.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-did-not-truly-get-to-know-his-father">Prince did not truly get to know his father</h2>



<p>Just two months before his passing, Aaron had checked himself into an outpatient program. </p>



<p>At the time, Martin had full temporary custody of Prince. Aaron clearly hoped to regain custody of their son.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Aaron did not live to set things right. </p>



<p>On some level, his loved ones will always wonder what he&#8217;d be like today if he were still with us.</p>

<p>Kaya Jones has spoken out against Nick Carter before.</p>



<p>Now, she&#8217;s doing so in a docuseries.</p>



<p>For years, the public and courtrooms alike have heard details of multiple women&#8217;s assault allegations towards Nick Carter. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/melissa-schuman-allegations-nick-carter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melissa Schuman&#8217;s allegations are part of the docuseries</a>, too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pussycat-dolls-alum-kaya-jones-has-spoken-out-against-nick-carter">Pussycat Dolls alum Kaya Jones has spoken out against Nick Carter</h2>



<p>In November of 2017, Melissa Schuman spoke out against Nick Carter, accusing him of sexual assault.</p>



<p>During a lengthy blog post at the time, she detailed how the two had worked together in the early 2000s. According to her allegations, Carter had sexually assaulted her.</p>



<p>One day after Schuman spoke out, Kaya Jones took to <a href="https://twitter.com/KayaJones/status/933367321623650304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to condemn the Backstreet Boys member.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="892" height="312" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0513_kayajones_tweet_01.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of Kaya Jones' tweet in November of 2017." class="wp-image-499807" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0513_kayajones_tweet_01.png 892w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0513_kayajones_tweet_01-300x105.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0513_kayajones_tweet_01-768x269.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In November of 2017, Kaya Jones took to Twitter to condemn Nick Carter and support the women accusing him of sexual assault.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Nick Carter was my boyfriend while I was in the Pussycat Dolls,” Kaya Jones wrote on Twitter at the time.</p>



<p>“He knew about the abuse I endured and did nothing. I guess I now know why,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Jones concluded her tweet: &#8220;Disgusting. Disgraceful. Disgusted in my heart. Especially because he was a victim of abuse himself. Shame on you Nick!”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-kaya-jones-mean">What does Kaya Jones mean?</h2>



<p>Jones has previously leveled accusations that she suffered abuse while part of the Pussycat Dolls.</p>



<p>While other members of the group have denied sharing her experience, she likened the group to a &#8220;prostitution ring&#8221; with music executives able to prey upon them.</p>



<p>Some have speculated that Jones may have been singled out by one or more predators within the industry. Sometimes, powerful industry predators will mislead victims to believe that &#8220;everyone&#8221; operates in this way. This deceitful tactic makes victims feel that they cannot come forward.</p>

<p>As for what Kaya Jones is saying about Carter in the 2017 tweet, it was seemingly a reference to Schuman&#8217;s November 18 blog post of that year.</p>



<p>At the time, Schuman (of the group Dream) alleged that Carter had removed her pants without her consent, performed oral sex on her against her will, and then sexually assaulted her in a bedroom.</p>



<p>Nick Carter has denied the allegations, as he has with multiple <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/nick-carter-sexual-assault-allegation-ashley-repp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other women who have come forward</a>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-carter-and-kaya-jones-showed-support-for-each-other">Aaron Carter and Kaya Jones showed support for each other</h2>



<p>In his final years, Aaron Carter spoke out strongly against his older brother. He emphasized that he believed that Nick was guilty of the crimes he had been accused of.</p>



<p>Nick Carter&#8217;s defenders have pointed out that Aaron Carter and at least some of the accusers (including Kaya Jones) have a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/aaron-carter-i-need-money-to-go-into-hiding-because-people-want/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of making outlandish statements</a>.</p>



<p>Supporters of the accusers have pointed out that the same is true of some of Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s accusers. And there is also the argument that sometimes people who are least likely to be believed become targets.</p>

<p>Airing on May 27 and May 28 on Investigation Discovery and streaming on Max, the series examines the brothers, the allegations, and more.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear from the trailer that Kaya Jones is not mincing words about Nick Carter. </p>



<p>That was also evident from her tweets.</p>

<p>Back in November of 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-died-without-a-will-state-will-decide-who-inherits-his-property-report/">Aaron Carter passed away </a>at his home in Lancaster, California.</p>



<p>Carter&#8217;s body was found in a bathtub full of water &#8212; a scene eerily reminiscent of Whitney Houston&#8217;s passing in 2012.</p>



<p>Naturally, outside observers were quick to conclude that Carter had met a similar fate.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, authorities announced <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">Carter&#8217;s cause of death</a>, and few were surprised to learn that he had lost consciousness due to multiple drug intoxication and drowned in just a few inches of water.</p>

(Photo by Scott Gries/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>But those who knew Aaron best maintain that there are many questions left unanswered by the official explanation for his demise.</p>



<p>His mother, Jane Carter, and his fiancée, Melanie Martin, are both convinced that there was foul play involved in Aaron&#8217;s passing. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carters-family-rejects-cause-of-death-findings-maintains-singer-was-murdered/">Martin spoke out</a> against the official ruling about Carter&#8217;s cause of death.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>And now, it looks as though the family has decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>



<p>According to a<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/20/aaron-carter-fiancee-second-autopsy-suspects-foul-play-dead-dies/"> new report</a> from TMZ, Melanie and the Carters are seeking to have Aaron&#8217;s case re-examined by a private investigator.</p>



<p>They also want a second autopsy, this one to be carried out by a private medical examiner hired by Aaron&#8217;s loved ones.</p>

<p>Melanie reported informed TMZ that she shares Jane&#8217;s belief that Aaron was murdered &#8212; both women point to the fact that Carter was wearing clothes in the bathtub as their primary evidence &#8212; but she&#8217;s worried they won&#8217;t be able to afford a private investigation.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s likely that the Carters will announce a fundraiser sometime in the near future.</p>



<p>“Still trying to get a real investigation for the death of my son Aaron Carter,” Jane wrote on Instagram last month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“They never investigated it as a possible crime scene because of his addiction past,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>“But they allowed people to go in and out.although a lot of potential homicide information was there for years. Aaron had a lot of death threats and many many people who were making his life miserable.”</p>



<p>Jane also alleged that the death threats were not “taken seriously by law enforcement” by police, who discriminated against Aaron because of his past struggles.</p>



<p></p>

<p>It remains to be seen if the Carters will be able to conduct their own investigation into Aaron&#8217;s final hours.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s very clear that Jane and Melanie believe this case is far from closed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been five months since<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-died-without-a-will-state-will-decide-who-inherits-his-property-report/"> Aaron Carter was found dead </a>in the bathroom of his Lancaster, California home.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, investigators finally revealed the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed-horrible-and-tragic/">cause of Carter&#8217;s death</a>.</p>



<p>A toxicology report indicated that the former child star drowned in his bathtub after passing out from a combination of Xanax and difluoroethane, an ingredient in household aerosol cleaners that can be huffed for a momentary high.</p>



<p>Carter had struggled with substance abuse throughout his life, and the findings aligned with what fans knew about his lifestyle.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin is the mother of Aaron Carter&#8217;s child. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But some of those were closest to Carter say they&#8217;re not buying the official explanation for his death.</p>



<p>Since the day of the singer&#8217;s demise, his fiancée, Melanie Martin, and his mother, Jane Carter, have remained firm in their belief that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/aaron-carters-mother-says-she-has-proof-he-was-murdered/">Aaron was murdered</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Martin has essentially launched a one-woman PR campaign with the apparent goal of having the investigation reopened.</p>

<p>“The results of the autopsy are not closure for me,” <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/18/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-drowning-xanax-alprazolam-huffing/">Martin told</a> TMZ this week. </p>



<p>“It claims death is by drowning but also adds he was wearing a t-shirt and necklace in the bathtub which doesn’t make sense, why would he be in a bathtub with clothes on?&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am still in shock and still miss Aaron every day. I don’t understand the chain of events and this report only has us asking more questions.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Melanie echoed those comments in an interview with UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>“I am not getting the closure I need because I don’t buy it,” she told the outlet.</p>



<p>“He was found with clothing on, the coroner told me, how would he have drowned with clothing on,&#8221; Martin added.</p>



<p>“I still have a lot more questions I would like answered regarding the police investigation,” Melanie continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Aaron was in the habit of huffing household cleaners during his live Instagram streams, but in his final interviews, he reported that he had given the habit up.</p>



<p>He admitted that he was on a “regimented medication” plan that involved Xanax, but he claimed he only used the sedative because it helped keep him “clean from huffing dust.”</p>



<p>The insistence that Carter was murdered is a little surprising coming from Melanie, who previously revealed that she was Aaron helping Aaron try to get sober in the day&#8217;s leading up to his tragic passing.</p>

<p>But Aaron&#8217;s mother has been claiming for months that material evidence found at the scene of her son&#8217;s death indicates foul play, and clearly, Melanie has joined her in that belief.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>We have an update on the passing of Aaron Carter.</p>



<p>As reported in November, the troubled <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">singer and reality star died</a> just about five and a half months ago at the young age of 34.</p>



<p>According to TMZ sources at the time, Carter’s corpse was discovered in a bathtub&#8230; with law enforcement officials telling the celebrity gossip website that they received a 911 call about an individual having drowned inside of his home.</p>



<p>No cause of death was announced back then.</p>

<p>Now, however, the Los Angeles Country Medical Examiner-Coroner has completed its investigation.</p>



<p>The musician reportedly drowned after inhaling difluoroethane &#8212; which is a gas often used in cans of compressed air &#8212; and after taking alprazolam, the generic form of brand-name Xanax.</p>



<p>The report states Carter was &#8220;incapacitated while in the bathtub&#8221; as the drugs took effect, slipping under the surface of the water and never coming back up.</p>



<p>TMZ broke this awful news late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Carter&#8217;s ex-fiancée, Melanie Martin, who is also the mother of his child, spoke to TMZ last night and said she questioned this report. </p>



<p>&#8220;The results of the autopsy are not closure for me,&#8221; Martin told the outlet. </p>



<p>&#8220;It claims death is by drowning but also adds he was wearing a t-shirt and necklace in the bathtub which doesn&#8217;t make sense, why would he be in a bathtub with clothes on? </p>



<p>&#8220;I am still in shock and still miss Aaron every day. I don’t understand the chain of events and this report only has us asking more questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter struggled with addiction over the years.</p>



<p>The brother of Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter, Aaron had said he was five years sober in early 2022, but he also checked into a rehab facility as recently as last September.</p>



<p>Carter was known for his early 2000s hits “Aaron’s Party (Come Get It),” “I Want Candy” and “That’s How I Beat Shaq.”</p>



<p>Martin <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carters-fiancee-breaks-silence-on-tragic-death-of-young-singer/">commented on the tragedy shortly after Aaron passed away</a> in November.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I love Aaron with all my heart and it’s going to be a journey to raise a son without a father,&#8221; Martin said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Please respect the privacy of my family as we come to terms with the loss of someone we love greatly.</p>



<p>“We are still in the process of accepting this unfortunate reality. Your thoughts and prayers are greatly appreciated.”</p>



<p>Eerily enough, a number of fans apparently believed this fall that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/melanie-martin-aaron-carters-fans-think-i-murdered-him/">Martin murdered Carter</a> &#8212; an allegation that is not supported by any evidence.</p>

<p>Said Nick Carter in response to his sibling&#8217;s death last year:</p>



<p>&#8220;My heart is broken.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though my brother and I have had a complicated relationship, my love for him has never ever faded. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have always held on to the hope that he would somehow, someday want to walk a healthy path and eventually find the help that he so desperately needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter faced many legal troubles and sought treatment for years due to his substance abuse addiction.</p>



<p>He was pulled over for suspicion of DUI less than a week before his death, although officers found that he wasn&#8217;t under the influence after conducting a field sobriety test.</p>



<p>&#8220;To my twin… I loved you beyond measure,&#8221; said sister Angel in response to Carter&#8217;s death. </p>



<p>&#8220;You will be missed dearly. My funny, sweet Aaron, I have so many memories of you … and I promise to cherish them. I know you&#8217;re at peace now. </p>



<p>&#8220;I will carry you with me until the day I die and get to see you again</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been four months since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">Aaron Carter passed away</a> in the bathroom of his home in Lancaster, California.</p>



<p>No official cause of death has been released, as investigators are still awaiting the results of a toxicology report.</p>



<p>Medical examiners confirmed, however, that despite being found in a bathtub full of water, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">Aaron did not drown</a>, a set of circumstances that&#8217;s led many to conclude the singer died of an overdose.</p>



<p>Police have stated that there was no sign of foul play, but now Aaron&#8217;s mother, Jane Carter, has revealed that she believes her son was murdered.</p>

<p>Jane took to Facebook this week to share some grisly photos from the scene of Aaron&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>One photo shows a bathtub full of green-tinted water, the coloring apparently a result of the fact that Carter&#8217;s body remained in the water for several hours after he died.</p>



<p>Others show feces splattered across the bathroom floor, which Jane says is evidence that Aaron was not in the bathtub when he died.</p>

<p>In the caption to her post, Jane wrote that she made the difficult decision to share the pics because she&#8217;s “still trying to get a real investigation for the death of my son.”</p>



<p>“I want to share these death scene photos with you all because the coroner wrote it off as an accidental drug overdose,” she explained.</p>



<p>“They never investigated it as a possible crime scene because of his addiction past,” she claimed of the star who had long struggled with addiction and mental health issues,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Jane went on to allege that police contaminated the crime scene shortly after they arrived, having apparently concluded that because Carter overdosed, there was no need to take the investigation seriously.</p>



<p>“Look at the photos. They were not taken by the police. But they allowed people to go in and out,” she said, adding that cops and other personnel proceeded “tromp through&#8221; the bathroom.</p>



<p>Aaron&#8217;s mom went on to refer to &#8220;death threats&#8221; that she says the LAPD failed to properly investigate.</p>

<p>The claimed “potential homicide information was there for years&#8221; and police ignored Aaron&#8217;s concerns about threats to his life.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are people who must be held accountable,&#8221; Jane concluded.</p>



<p>Police have not publicly responded to Jane&#8217;s accusations.</p>

<p>Someone very close to Aaron Carter has provided an update on the state of the artist before he passed away this month.</p>



<p>In an interview with Page Six, Taylor Helgeson., who served as a manager for the troubled artist, said he saw Carter just two days before his body was found inside his California home.</p>



<p>“He looked thin. He was extremely tired,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/11/17/aaron-carter-was-in-physical-decline-before-he-died-manager/">Helgeson told this outlet</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;He just looked like he needed to be doing anything but working. He looked like he needed to be taking care of him.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">Carter was discovered by a housekeeper</a> back on November 4 and pronounced dead at the scene after paramedics arrived.</p>



<p>No cause of death has been announced.</p>



<p>However, Carter had an extensive history of substance abuse, having been in and out of rehab on several occasions over the years.</p>



<p>Prior to his passing, though, Carter had recently said he was clean and sober.</p>

<p>Helgeson had been managing Carter for eight months at the time of this tragedy.</p>



<p>He explained to Page Six that he met the artist at a music studio the week he passed because they had plans to work on a new album together</p>



<p>“He didn’t seem okay,” Helgeson says now, elaborating as follows: </p>



<p>“He didn’t seem okay <em>physically</em> … [but] mentally, he was the most excited I’ve seen him in months. </p>



<p>&#8220;He was very intelligent and he was very conscious of what people wanted to see from him.”</p>

<p>There are no plans at the moment to release any new music from Carter.</p>



<p>In September, Carter shared with the public that he had checked himself into an outpatient program in order to try and regain custody of his son Prince, whom he shared with on-again, off-again fiancé, Melanie Martin.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carters-fiancee-breaks-silence-on-tragic-death-of-young-singer/">Said Martin in the wake of losing Carter</a>:</p>



<p>“I love Aaron with all my heart and it’s going to be a journey to raise a son without a father. Please respect the privacy of my family as we come to terms with the loss of someone we love greatly. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are still in the process of accepting this unfortunate reality. Your thoughts and prayers are greatly appreciated.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-was-his-death-a-suicide/">Aaron Carter was found dead</a> in the bathroom of his Lancaster, California home, but fans still have more questions than answers.</p>



<p>We have little in the way of official information about the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">cause of Carter&#8217;s death</a>, and it seems that for the singer&#8217;s loved ones, the situation is about the become even more complicated.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/13/aaron-carter-died-dead-without-will-son-inherit-assets-prince/">new report</a> from TMZ, Aaron did not have a will when he died, which means that his entire estate is up for grabs.</p>



<p>In many cases, that would mean difficult times and rocky legal battles ahead for the surviving family.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Aaron Carter is just hanging out and relaxing in a car in this Instagram photo. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But for two very big reasons, the Carters probably won&#8217;t end up duking it out in court with Aaron&#8217;s fiancée, Melanie Martin:</p>



<p>Aaron and Melanie welcomed their first child together last year, and legal experts say Prince &#8212; who will soon celebrate his first birthday &#8212; stands to inherit his father&#8217;s entire estate.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not a whole lot to inherit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the other reason Aaron&#8217;s lack of a will won&#8217;t create many problems for his family:</p>



<p>According to TMZ, the former child star was living a &#8220;hand to mouth&#8221; existence in the months before his death.</p>



<p>Carter earned millions over the course of his career, but he had not had much work in recent years, and it seems that his mortgage and other monthly expenses devoured what was left of his savings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The circumstances surrounding the death of Aaron Carter remain mysterious. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Aaron was reportedly living off of meager royalties checks and whatever money he earned from Cameo and the occasional sponsored content deal.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there should be some money waiting for Prince once the dust settles.</p>



<p>Aaron&#8217;s house was on the market at the time of his death, and the boy will reportedly receive 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/hilary-duff-blasts-allegations-about-sexual-relationship-with-aaron-carter-you-people-are-sick/">Carter had also completed work on a memoir</a> just months before his death.</p>



<p>The book was originally slated for release on November 15, but the date has been pushed back out of respect for Aaron&#8217;s family.</p>



<p>While there was a time when project might have been dismissed as just another celebrity tell-all, it will likely enjoy robust sales in the wake of the singer&#8217;s death, which means more money for Prince.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Aaron Carter fans were concerned for his well-being in the weeks leading up to his death. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insiders say Carter was hard at work rebuilding his music career at the time of his death, but sadly, he was unable to complete his final album.</p>



<p>Making the situation even more tragic are reports that Aaron hoped to heal the divisions within his family with lyrics in which he apologized to his brother Nick and others he had hurt in recent years.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the long-suffering Carter clan will soon be able to find some peace.</p>

<p>The coroner&#8217;s report will likely corroborate the prevailing theory that Carter&#8217;s death was the result of a multiple drug toxicity.</p>



<p>But this is 2022, which means that thousands of internet randos feel the need to offer their own theories about how Aaron died.</p>



<p>Many believe that Carter took his own life, despite the fact that there&#8217;s zero evidence to support those claims.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The circumstances surrounding the death of Aaron Carter remain mysterious. Now, a close friend of Aaron&#8217;s is offering new insights. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>And now, an even more baseless and damaging claim is making the rounds on social media.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/11/aaron-carter-fiancee-melanie-martin-harassment/">new report</a> from TMZ, a growing contingent of Aaron&#8217;s fans are convinced that the singer was murdered by his on-again, off-again fiancée, Melanie Martin.</p>



<p>Melanie and Aaron&#8217;s relationship was notoriously contentious, and both parties struggled with addiction and mental health issues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>That said, there&#8217;s zero evidence that she had anything to do with his death, and Martin was <em>not</em> in the house at the time of Carter&#8217;s passing.</p>



<p>But that hasn&#8217;t stopped social media users from hurling wildly dangerous accusations at the mother of Aaron&#8217;s infant son.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m calling it, Melanie murdered Aaron,&#8221; wrote one Twitter user.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;She texted him days ago saying &#8216;you’re going to die&#8217; and days ago Aaron called her Voldemort. Today Melanie posts on social media a vid of her crying while driving! Who does that??? Suspicious!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Melanie paid the housekeeper to kill Aaron,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>In response to news that Martin requested a police escort to protect her while she retrieved items she had left behind in Aaron&#8217;s house, several conspiracy theorists accused her of suspicious behavior.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The irony of the situation is that Melanie was reportedly working tirelessly to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-heres-how-his-ex-fiancee-nearly-saved-his-life/">try and save Aaron&#8217;s life</a> in the weeks leading up to his death, and she succeeded in convincing him to participate in an outpatient rehab program.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the people accusing her of murder are receiving a good deal of pushback from more level-headed observers. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is disgusting you should be ashamed,&#8221; one Twitter user argued in response to an allegation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;She was begging him to get sober otherwise &#8216;you’re going to die&#8217; as in he would OD if he didn’t stop and she was begging for her child’s father to live. You just spit in the face of every Addicts partner or parent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sometime in the next few weeks, Aaron&#8217;s official cause of death will be made public.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we encourage all who feel compelled to comment on the situation to bear in mind that his loved ones are grieving human beings going through a very difficult time.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard by now, former child star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-was-his-death-a-suicide/">Aaron Carter passed away</a> last week at his home in Lancaster, California.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">cause of Aaron&#8217;s death</a> is not yet known, but it&#8217;s believed that the 34-year-old succumbed to his lifelong battle with addiction.</p>



<p>It could be weeks before we gain a complete picture of Aaron&#8217;s final hours, and of course, his loved ones will mourn the departed pop icon for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>But amazingly, a new biography about Carter&#8217;s life is being rushed out in a matter of days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Aaron Carter fans were concerned for his well-being in the weeks leading up to his death. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The publishers of <em>Aaron Carter: An Incomplete Story of an Incomplete Life</em> say that author Andy Symonds completed the book over the past three years, with the full cooperation of Aaron. </p>



<p>The biography, complete with its salacious title, is set to hit stores on November 15.</p>



<p>Many who were close to Aaron have condemned the project, but perhaps none has been more vocal than actress Hilary Duff, who briefly dated Aaron when they were both in their early teens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really sad that within a week of Aaron&#8217;s death, there&#8217;s a publisher that seems to be recklessly pushing a book out to capitalize on this tragedy without taking appropriate time or care to fact check the validity of his work,&#8221; Duff <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1354190/hilary-duff-slams-disgusting-book-publisher-for-releasing-aaron-carters-unfinished-memoir">said in a statement</a> issued to E! News.</p>



<p>&#8220;To water down Aaron&#8217;s life story to what seems to be unverified click-bait for profit is disgusting. In no way do I condone shedding any light on what is so obviously an uninformed, heartless, money grab,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>Ballast has already confirmed that the book will contain the claim that Carter and Duff lost their virginity to one another when she was 13, and he was just 12.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Hilary and I lost our virginity to each other at a hotel… in LA,” Carter allegedly wrote in the unfinished tell-all. </p>



<p>“I think it was her birthday, maybe her 13th, but I don’t remember. Her friends walked in, and we just yelled at them to get out.”</p>



<p>Somewhat surprisingly, Aaron&#8217;s management team issued a statement supporting Duff and urging Ballast to either delay the release of the book or cancel it altogether.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The circumstances surrounding the death of Aaron Carter remain mysterious. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“We would never comment on Hilary’s personal life in this way,&#8221; the statement reads.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a time for mourning and reflection not heartless money grabs and attention seeking,&#8221; Carter&#8217;s management team continued.</p>



<p>Duff was one of many celebrities who issued heartfelt statements paying tribute to Aaron in the wake of his untimely passing.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;For Aaron- I&#8217;m deeply sorry that life was so hard for you and that you had to struggle in-front of the whole world,&#8221; Hilary wrote on Instagram last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;You had a charm that was absolutely effervescent…boy did my teenage self love you deeply. Sending love to your family at this time. Rest easy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aaron is missed by many, and no doubt there are numerous fans who are eager to learn the details of his final days.</p>

<p></p>



<p>But this is not the time for an unauthorized biography.</p>



<p>Sadly, it looks as though there&#8217;s no stopping the book at this point.</p>
