<p>Sophie Skelton is a fan favorite as Brianna Fraser on the Starz drama <em>Outlander,</em> but fans are hoping to see her pop up in another iconic franchise. </p>



<p>Many <em>Harry Potter </em>fans have named Sophie as their top choice to play the Boy Who Lived&#8217;s mom, Lily Potter (n√©e Evans), in a new series. </p>



<p>Lucky for fans, Sophie doesn&#8217;t seem totally opposed to the idea, and she has some theories herself about why Potterheads want to see her as Harry Potter&#8217;s mom.</p>



<p>While nothing has been set for an upcoming <em>Harry Potter </em>series, fans can see Sophie playing another iconic redhead on <em>Outlander</em>, which returns soon. In the meantime, dive into some of the fan-casting theories!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-want-sophie-skelton-as-lily-potter">Fans Want Sophie Skelton As Lily Potter</h2>



<p>Since the original <em>Harry Potter </em>films ended in 2011, many Potterheads share actors they&#8217;d like to see in a reboot. Sophie&#8217;s name has come up for Lily in various adaptations in recent years.</p>



<p>Scrolling through fan communities on sites like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/104w5q3/my_fancast_for_harry_potters_kidswhat_you_guys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/sapphicwhxre/651694131043762176/sophie-skelton-as-lily-potter-n%C3%A9e-evans-not-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/sophie-skelton-talking-about-lily-evans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>, many people name the <em>So Awkward </em>actress in their fan casts. Many people share screen grabs from <em>Outlander </em>to emphasize just how perfect Sophie would be as Lily.</p>



<p>The fans feel that she looks the part of a young Lily Potter. Some online folks have suggested that she would be a great fit in an adaptation set during the &#8220;Marauders&#8221; era, when Harry&#8217;s parents were at Hogwarts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sophie-skelton-s-reaction-to-the-fan-casts">Sophie Skelton&#8217;s Reaction To The Fan Casts</h2>



<p>Sophie addressed the fans&#8217; desire to see her as Lily in an appearance on Oliver and James Phelps&#8217; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K1Ldcynk94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a><em> Normal Not Normal</em>. The twin actors notably played Fred and George Weasley in the original <em>HP </em>films. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>One of the twins mentioned that he&#8217;d seen her name floated for Lily Potter while in the middle of the interview. He seemed particularly amused about her connection to the Wizarding World.</p>



<p>She explained her theory as to why fans want to see her as &#8220;Harry&#8217;s mum.&#8221; Sophie cited one of the key physical attributes of Brianna Fraser.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s &#8217;cause my character has red hair. So, I&#8217;m a faux-redhead, like you two, I suppose. So, most of the stuff I get tagged in is Lily Potter fan cast,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>She continued to say that many people have used clips of her in <em>Outlander </em>for edits, and many people have even photoshopped her in some Hogwarts swag.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always been sort of rumored about, and then, it&#8217;s just kind of snowballed a lot, I think, over the years. There&#8217;s a lot of photo edits of Brianna, changing into Lily,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of pictures out there of me with Gryffindor scarves and things. I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Cool, honorary Gryffindor for the time being. I&#8217;ll take it,'&#8221; she continued. </p>



<p>Sophie clearly didn&#8217;t seem bothered by the comparisons. In fact, she embraced the idea of getting to be a redhead again. She seemed honored by the fact that fans would want to her in that role.</p>



<p>&#8220;One day, who knows? If there&#8217;s a sort of prequel to the movies, I&#8217;ll put the red wig back on and do that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-upcoming-harry-potter-series">Upcoming &#8216;Harry Potter&#8217; Series</h2>



<p>Even though <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 </em>premiered in 2011, fans have had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/10/jk-rowling-to-release-new-harry-potter-story-on-halloween-which/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ample opportunities </a>to return to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/10/jk-rowling-hints-at-new-harry-potter-book-on-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Wizarding World</a>. From <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/10/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-sequel-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </a></em>on Broadway to the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies, there&#8217;s no shortage of ways to get your<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/07/jk-rowling-brings-harry-potter-back-in-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Harry Potter </em>fix.</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a &#8220;Marauders&#8221; series in the works, but fans will get the chance to see the Boy Who Lived brought to the small screen in the near future. </p>



<p>Warner Bros announced plans to reboot the franchise as a TV series on HBO&#8217;s MAX streaming platform, per <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a></em>. The series is expected to premiere in 2026. Each season will be based on one of the books.</p>



<p>Casting has not been announced, but it&#8217;s possible for Sophie to appear as Lily Potter. Even though Lily and Harry&#8217;s father James are dead at the series&#8217; beginning, they do appear in some key scenes. </p>



<p>Harry&#8217;s parents appear in key moments throughout the series, like the Mirror of Erised or in the graveyard when Lord Voldemort returns. There are also opportunities for flashbacks throughout the series.</p>



<p>As for a &#8220;Marauders&#8221; series, fans will simply have to keep dreaming for a spinoff.</p>
