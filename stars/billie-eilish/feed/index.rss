<p>Is the Billie Eilish vs. Taylor Swift rivalry escalating into a full-blown feud?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the question fans are asking after Billie appeared to throw some mild shade at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/taylor-swift-security-costs-travis-kelce-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s Eras Tour</a> during a recent livestream.</p>



<p>Billie noted that she won&#8217;t be putting on any three-hour concerts. And she seemed to condemn artists (like Taylor) who do exactly that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-billie-eilish-shade-taylor-swift">Did Billie Eilish Shade Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>“Nobody wants that,” Billie remarked, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/05/24/entertainment/billie-eilish-shades-taylor-swift-beyonces-three-hour-concerts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>. “You guys don’t want that. I don’t want that. I don’t even want that as a fan.</p>



<p>“Even my favorite artists, I’m not trying to hear them for three hours. That’s far too long,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter) and other platforms, Swifties clapped back at Billie&#8217;s remarks. They noted that many fans <em>do</em> want marathon concerts.</p>

<p>“Millions of people seem to want that but ok,” <a href="https://x.com/taychonne/status/1793967189654958335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s weird saying that when all of the shows were sold out and even made into a movie that ppl bought tickets to also see so saying ‘nobody wants that’ is an actual lie,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/lemy_27/status/1793967616480215477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another added</a>.</p>



<p>Other users came to Billie&#8217;s defense and pointed out that she never mentioned Taylor by name.</p>

<p>In fact, she&#8217;s been known to praise Taylor, Beyonce, and others for their ability to put on massive stadium shows.</p>



<p>“The fact that they can put on a show that long, and it’s filled with so many incredible moments, is really amazing,” Billie gushed to the <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-10-11/billie-eilish-barbie-finneas-what-was-i-made-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a></em> in 2023.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that Billie has been accused of throwing subtle shade at Taylor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-billie-seemed-to-criticize-taylor-for-releasing-multiple-versions-of-the-same-album">Billie Seemed to Criticize Taylor For Releasing Multiple Versions of the Same Album</h2>



<p>“We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it’s very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging,&#8221; Billie said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/billie-eilish-sustainability-eco-friendly-initiatives-mom-1235642455/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a></em>.</p>



<p>She noted that this practice &#8220;ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money&#8221; but is bad for the environment due to &#8220;wasteful&#8221; packaging.</p>



<p>Many fans theorized that the comments were inspired by Taylor&#8217;s decision to release bonus content on the same day that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/billie-eilish-sexuality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billie&#8217;s latest album</a> hit stores.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1024x683.jpg" alt='Billie Eilish attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An Anthology of Fashion" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.' class="wp-image-500670" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1395043589-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Billie Eilish attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;In America: An Anthology of Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Eilish clarified that she had no intention of “singling anyone out,&#8221; noting that the practice is an “industry-wide systemic issue.”</p>



<p>“Okay so it would be so awesome if people would stop putting words into my mouth and actually read what I said,” she wrote on <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/01/entertainment/billie-eilish-hits-back-at-taylor-swift-fans-over-wasteful-packaging-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. </p>



<p>“When it comes to variants, so many artists release them, including me, which I clearly state in the article.”</p>



<p>Taylor has not publicly responded to any of this alleged shame. But if we&#8217;re lucky, maybe she&#8217;ll clap back in song form.</p>

<p>Billie Eilish&#8217;s upcoming album is direct about her attraction to women. Her new interview is even <em>more </em>direct.</p>



<p>Years ago, trolls <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/06/billie-eilish-accused-of-queerbaiting-as-fans-turn-on-singer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Billie Eilish of &#8220;queerbaiting&#8221;</a> even though that term applies to entertainment media, not to real people. </p>



<p>In 2023, Billie spoke of her attraction to women. But she didn&#8217;t really intend to &#8220;come out&#8221; in that moment.</p>



<p>Now, that has changed. In fact, one of Billie&#8217;s newest songs is about a very palpable desire for women. And she wrote the song before <em>and </em>after her first time with another woman.</p>

So ahead of the album, Billie sat down with <em>Rolling Stone</em> for <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billie-eilish-hit-me-hard-and-soft-mental-health-fame-1235003585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the May 2024 cover story</a>.</p>



<p>One of the songs, &#8220;Lunch,&#8221; arose as the 22-year-old artist examined her own sexuality. The songwriting process involved some very important self-discovery.</p>



<p>“That song was actually part of what helped me become who I am, to be real,” Billie Eilish expressed. “I wrote some of it before even doing anything with a girl, and then wrote the rest after.”</p>

<p>&#8220;Lunch&#8221; involves <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/billie-eilish-destroys-body-shamers-this-is-just-how-i-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billie Eilish harboring</a> such an intense crush on a girl that she “likens sex with her to devouring a meal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sometimes, the best expressions of sexual desire are very similar to discussing hunger. So long as you don&#8217;t cross the line into cannibalism, it&#8217;s a great way to be horny in a poetic way.</p>



<p>“I’ve been in love with girls for my whole life, but I just didn’t understand,&#8221; Billie acknowledged. &#8220;Until, last year, I realized I wanted my face in a vagina.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-realized-i-wanted-my-face-in-a-vagina-is-an-amazing-sentence">&#8216;I realized I wanted my face in a vagina&#8217; is an amazing sentence</h2>



<p>Billie Eilish&#8217;s lyrics are subtler, but only slightly.</p>



<p>“I could eat that girl for lunch / Yeah, she dances on my tongue / Tastes like she might be the one,&#8221; she sings. &#8220;And I can never get enough / I could buy you so much stuff / It’s a craving, not a crush.”</p>



<p>That&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s something that many listeners will find viscerally relatable. And I, for one, cannot wait to hear the Kidz Bop version.</p>

<p>During previous interviews, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/06/billie-eilish-destroys-all-lives-matter-trolls-in-epic-rant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billie Eilish has felt taken aback</a> by questions about her sexuality. Clearly, she feels more comfortable with the topic now.</p>



<p>“I went into Billie Eilish interview mode, [like], ‘Oh, I don’t care. Yeah, I’ll say whatever. Wasn’t it obvious?’” she recalled of her 2023 <em>Variety </em>interview. “And then afterwards I was like, ‘Wait. It wasn’t obvious to me.’”</p>



<p>Sometimes, people feel like they are the last to know something obvious about themselves. And no, &#8220;<em>we all knew</em>&#8221; does not make them feel better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-billie-know-that-many-people-cannot-come-out-as-easily-as-she-has">Billie know that many people cannot come out as easily as she has</h2>



<p>“I’m lucky enough to be in a time when I’m able to say something like that and things go OK for me,” she acknowledged. “That’s not how a lot of people’s experience is.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Billie &#8212; who has only (publicly) dated men in the past &#8212; feels frustrated with questions about sexuality labels. Some people change sexuality labels over time, and others eschew them altogether.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that there’s a lot of wanting labels all over the place. … It takes a while to find yourself,&#8221; she sagely observed. &#8220;and I think it’s really unfair, the way that the internet bullies you into talking about who you are and what you are.”</p>

<p>Officially, Billie Eilish&#8217;s most recent relationship was with Jesse Rutherford, a fellow singer-songwriter. They are no longer together, </p>



<p>Billie seemed to spend time with actress Ava Capri after the 2023 Met Gala, which prompted rumors. </p>



<p>More recently, Billie&#8217;s appearance on multiple TikTok videos with Quenlin Blackwell has spawned new rumors. Especially after the two spent time together at Coachella.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-billie-eilish-have-a-girlfriend">Does Billie Eilish have a girlfriend?</h2>



<p>According to Coachella goers, Billie Eilish pulled in Quenlin for a kiss while playing &#8220;Lunch&#8221; for attendees.</p>



<p>That said, a kiss &#8212; especially during a performance &#8212; is not the same as any sort of relationship confirmation.</p>



<p>Billie will announce a relationship, no matter the gender of her partner, if and when she chooses. We&#8217;re happy that she knows herself and that she&#8217;s devouring life experiences with gusto.</p>

<p>Billie Eilish is thriving. She is minding her own business. She is a music superstar.</p>



<p>But after some recent glimpses of her, some weirdos are giving her a hard time.</p>



<p>Billie has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/billie-eilish-destroys-body-shamers-this-is-just-how-i-look/">obliterated body-shamers</a> before. And she&#8217;ll do it again, we&#8217;re sure.</p>



<p>This time, the trolls aren&#8217;t after her body shape &#8212; but the massive tattoo across her back.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, October 18, Billie Eilish took to social media to share a series of looks. Just little snapshots of her October thus far.</p>



<p>Among them, one in particular caught people&#8217;s eye.</p>



<p>She is lying on her stomach. Presumably, she&#8217;s at a tattoo shop. Her back is exposed &#8212; but not fully bare. Because she has a tattoo.</p>

<p>As you can see in the video below, Billie&#8217;s tattoo is colossal, the ink sprawling across her back in a very intricate design.</p>



<p>It turns up her spine. And at least some of it appears fresh.</p>



<p>What we should all keep in mind is that sharing a photo on Instagram does not always mean that it&#8217;s fresh. That tattoo could be in the healing stages right now &#8230; or it could be, for <em>her</em>, old news.</p>

<p>You can clearly see for yourself that the tattoo appears to be a work in progress.</p>



<p>Now, I&#8217;m no tattoo expert. Almost all of my knowledge about them comes from art history classes or &#8220;very hot people on social media getting tattoos.&#8221; There are, as the saying goes, two wolves inside me.</p>



<p>But the tattoo is likely unfinished. We don&#8217;t just mean that the photo below requires on-the-spot cleanup. It might, as many large tattoos do, require multiple sessions with the tattoo artist before it is complete.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re really excited to see the finished art! Though that&#8217;s her business.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is Billie&#8217;s body. She can show it off if and when she so chooses. That <em>could </em>mean that she never does.</p>



<p>(Especially, not that she would need an excuse, but especially because flaunting the whole thing likely means being topless)</p>

<p>By the way, Billie has more tattoos than this one. Even if it is by far the most impressive.</p>



<p>The 21-year-old music superstar has a tattoo on her chest that simply reads &#8220;Eilish.&#8221;</p>



<p>She has a dragon tattoo on her thigh. And she has a fairy tattoo on her hand. Those are all fantastic vibes!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not everyone is as excited about Billie&#8217;s new living art display.</p>



<p>Some people are shaming her &#8212; saying that the tattoo (so far) is &#8220;ugly&#8221; or &#8220;messy,&#8221; or simply for getting such a large tattoo.</p>



<p>The world is full of people who tell young people that they&#8217;ll regret their own choices. Sometimes they&#8217;re right. But the world is full of old people who regret things that they <em>could </em>have done, but did not, when they were young.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Unfortunately, people sometimes don&#8217;t know how to not be weird about celebrities.</p>
<p>Billie Eilish is 19 years old, but has to contend with <a href="/2020/12/billie-eilish-destroys-body-shamers-this-is-just-how-i-look/">creepy body-shamers</a> and obsessed stans.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the &#8220;Bad Guy&#8221; singer was accused of queerbaiting her fans.</p>
<p>Is that what she&#8217;s doing?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Before we get into the controversy, here are the facts.</p>
<p>Billie Eilish is a 19-year-old singer and an extraordinary musical talent.</p>
<p>Her latest single is &#8220;Lost Cause.&#8221; Yes, this is very relevant.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&#8220;Lost Cause&#8221; has a music video starring Billie alongside numerous other women.</p>
<p>In the video, the women dance in a suggestive manner with general &#8220;college age hot girl slumber party&#8221; vibes.</p>
<p>All pretty par for the course for music videos, and frankly tame in comparison to many. </p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>So, a few days ago, Billie shared some behind-the-scenes snaps from the music video.</p>
<p>The photos were of her hanging out with other women from the music video.</p>
<p>The video has a relatively small cast, and Billie captioned the photos: &#8220;I love girls.&#8221;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It&#8217;s all super cute &#8230; but also set the stage for what was to come.</p>
<p>Now, Billie has very recently been spotted with Matthew Tyler Vorce, an actor.</p>
<p>Though nothing has been confirmed, they appear to have gone on dates, including to Disneyland.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Despite the lack of confirmation, the two are being labeled as dating.</p>
<p>Many fans have referred to Matthew as Billie&#8217;s &#8220;boyfriend.&#8221;</p>
<p>But other fans have seen this, seen Billie&#8217;s post, and become outraged.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>There has been speculation for years that Billie might be part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really based upon rumors so much as a &#8220;vibe&#8221; that some perceived, possibly just a lot of wishful thinking.</p>
<p>But Billie&#8217;s post and the apparent dating news have gotten her accused of queerbaiting.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>What is queerbaiting?</p>
<p>This is a complicated term that often comes up in fandom circles, but also applies to broader pop culture.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is that you try to trick LGBTQ+ audiences into following a piece of media &#8230; but never plan to actually deliver.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a TV series where two men are constantly assumed to be a couple, some viewers might hope that they&#8217;re getitng representation.</p>
<p>If that show never shows either man to be anything other than straight, however, it might be queerbaiting.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes it&#8217;s unintentional. Sometimes, storytellers are censored. It&#8217;s a complicated, nuanced topic.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, sometimes the accusation is thrown around inaccurately.</p>
<p>For example, if a person (or character) is part of the LGBTQ+ it&#8217;s not queerbaiting, even if they don&#8217;t get with the person that fans are hoping for.</p>
<p>And similarly, queerbaiting is supposed to be an intentional practice. It&#8217;s been done in the past to drive up followings for shows that will <em>never </em>deliver.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>To translate this into something that may be more accessible to the straight community &#8230;</p>
<p>If a woman smiles at and is nice to a man, whether she&#8217;s his cashier or they&#8217;re work colleagues, she&#8217;s not leading him on.</p>
<p>While queerbaiting is very real, sometimes, people lead themselves on &#8230; and then get angry.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In this case, fans &#8212; especially overly obsessed teenage stans &#8212; may have overthought themselves into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Billie&#8217;s post didn&#8217;t have to mean &#8220;coming out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plenty of people &#8220;love girls.&#8221; Jumping to conclusions does a disservice to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>A man can wear a dress without being trans.</p>
<p>A woman can dress in a butch manner with the same being true.</p>
<p>And yes, a straight woman &#8212; if Billie is indeed straight &#8212; can talk about how much she loves her fellow women.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="725" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-725x1024.jpg" alt="Billie Eilish at 2019 AMAs" class="wp-image-338714" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-725x1024.jpg 725w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-212x300.jpg 212w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-768x1085.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-1087x1536.jpg 1087w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-1450x2048.jpg 1450w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-735x1038.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-237x335.jpg 237w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-246x347.jpg 246w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-368x520.jpg 368w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-453x640.jpg 453w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-544x768.jpg 544w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-680x960.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-765x1080.jpg 765w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/billie-eilish-at-2019-amas-scaled.jpg 1812w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>There&#8217;s another, important angle to this that some of these stans may be missing.</p>
<p>Billie wouldn&#8217;t have to be <em>straight </em>to be dating a dude.</p>
<p>Bi and pan people exist, and it&#8217;s very likely that they outnumber all of the rest of us combined.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Flipping out because someone you imagined was gay appears to be straight is always bad.</p>
<p>Casually erasing the existence of bi people is also always bad.</p>
<p>Both are particularly bad things to do during Pride Month.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Just for the record, a bi woman dating a man is not &#8220;queerbaiting.&#8221; She&#8217;s still bi.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Billie is. Only she gets to define her sexuality.</p>
<p>And by the way, Billie does not owe anyone an explanation. Her stans need to calm the eff down.</p>

<p>She has also been thrust into the role of being a body-positive role model for young fans after body-shamers came after her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Billie Eilish sat down for an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS2x1zl4rn0&amp;t=1139s"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>&nbsp;about so much, from rumors to body-shaming.</p>
<p>First up, she shot down the rumor that she&#8217;s pregnant. (She&#8217;s 18, wtf?!)</p>
<p>She also shot down the rumor that she, um, worships Satan. That wouldn&#8217;t be anyone&#8217;s business if it were true, but no, it&#8217;s not true.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Earlier this year, there was a viral moment that had nothing to do with Billie&#8217;s musical talents.</p>
<p>Instead, all eyes were on her after she was spotted wearing a tank top instead of her usual baggy clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this picture of me running from my car to my brother&rsquo;s front door on like a 110 degree day in a tank top,&quot; Billie reflected in her interview.</p>

<p>The body-shamers were deeply disgusting.</p>
<p>&quot;And people were like, &lsquo;Damn, Billie got fat!&#8217;&rdquo; Billie recalled this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Nope, this is how I look, you&rsquo;ve just never seen it before!&rsquo;&quot; she explains.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>While Billie was speaking in the context of &quot;current rumors,&quot; there was more to her response than body-shaming.</p>
<p>A disgusting number of adult men decided to fetishize her figure &#8212; a normal body with a soft tummy and an above-average bust &#8212; even though she is a teenager.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that body positivity can include appreciation, but fetishization and creepy leering is not really a step up from body-shaming.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Billie did affirmt hat she is pleased and even proud that her message of body positivity has reached her fans.</p>
<p>Many of her fans are younger, or may be struggling with body image in our society regardless of their age.</p>
<p>Billie really appreciates the way that her younger fans, many going through some of the most emotionally exhausting years of their lives, could draw strength from her viral moment.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I love having kids relate to me,&quot; Billie gushed during her interview.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she remarked, she loves it when younger fans &quot;tell me that I make them feel comfortable in their bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I can do anything,&quot; the extremely talented Grammy winner announced, &quot;I want to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billie has remarked in the past about how she, and countless other women both in and out of the entertainment industry, seemingly cannot win.</p>
<p>If she covers up by wearing comfortable, baggy clothes like countless male entertainers, she&#8217;s &quot;too masculine&quot; and &quot;not sexy enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if she dresses in tighter or more revealing clothing, then she&#8217;s a &quot;slut&quot; in the eyes of disgusting misogynists.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Billie Eilish is a young talent, and due to her age and popularity has been likened to a Gen Z equivalent to Lorde.</p>
<p>Some of us had a soft spot for her before her dramatic rise to fame, as her mother voiced a beloved and recurring character in the <em>Mass Effect </em>video game series.</p>
<p>It is always good to see someone talented use their platform to improve the lives of others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Celebrity takes on these impassioned nationwide protests have ranged from being <a href="/2020/06/lady-gaga-destroys-donald-trump-what-a-dangerous-racist-fool/">right on the money</a> to being tone deaf or even vicious.</p>
<p>Billie Eilish, one of the most accomplished young musicians on the planet, is taking &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; racists to task for this pernicious motto.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve been trying to take this week to figure out a way to address this delicately,&quot; Billie begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I have an enormous platform,&quot; she writes to her 63.6 million Instagram followers and anyone else reading.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she explains, &quot;I try really hard to be respectful and take time to think through what I say and how I say it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But holy f-cking s&#8211;t,&quot; Billie exclaims, &quot;I&#8217;m just gonna start talking.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;If I hear one more white person say &#8216;aLL liVeS maTtEr&#8217; one more f&#8211;king time, I&#8217;m gonna lose my f&#8211;king mind,&quot; Billie declares.</p>
<p>Notably, <em>all lives matter</em> is a phrase that did not crop up until the Black Lives Matter movement took form, as a tactic to silence BLM.</p>
<p>Also, over the weekend, a white man declared &quot;all lives matter&quot; before trying to shoot black men with arrows.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you shut the f&#8211;k up?&quot; Billie righteously demands.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;No one is saying your life is not hard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one is saying literally anything at all about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All you mfs do is find a way to make everything about yourself.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Society gives you privilege just for being white,&quot; Billie acknowledges.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many people&#8217;s knee-jerk reactions claim, this is true.</p>
<p>&quot;You can be poor,&quot; she explains, &quot;you can be struggling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Billie continues, &quot;still your skin color is giving you more privilege than you even realize&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;And nobody is saying that makes you better than anyone,&quot; Billie says.</p>
<p>&quot;It just lets you live your life,&quot; she reasons.</p>
<p>Billie explains that those of us who are white can go through life &quot;without having to worry about surviving simply because of your skin color!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are privileged!!&quot; she explains.</p>

<p>&quot;If all lives matter,&quot; Billie poses the question, &quot;why are back people killed for just being black?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why are immigrants persecuted?&quot; she asks.</p>
<p>Billie goes on to ask: &quot;Why are white people given opportunities that people of other races aren&#8217;t?&quot;</p>
<p>Those of us who are white are given the benefit of the doubt in situations where people of color are not.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Why is it okay for white people to protest literally being asked to stay at home while carrying semi-automatic weapons?&quot; Billie asks.</p>
<p>She is referring to the heavily armed goons who stormed government buildings in a menacing display of their &quot;rights&quot; with no pushback from police.</p>
<p>She then asks: &quot;Why is it okay for black people to be called thugs for protesting the murder of innocent people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;White. F&#8211;king. Privilege,&quot; Billie explains.</p>

<p>&quot;We have to address hundreds of years of oppression of black people,&quot; Billie explains to her fans and followers.</p>
<p>Then, as if having to explain it to a small child, she writes: &quot;The slogan of #BlackLivesMatter does not mean other lives don&#8217;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s calling attention to the fact that society clearly thinks black lives don&#8217;t f&#8211;king matter,&quot; Billie laments.</p>
<p>She affirms: &quot;And they f&#8211;king do.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;It means Black. Lives. F&#8211;king. Matter,&quot; Billie declares.</p>
<p>She repeats: &quot;Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter,&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When Eminem&#8217;s pseudo-biopic 8 Mile hit theaters in 2002, it was an instant hit with critics and audiences, and the film&#8217;s soundtrack became one of the year&#8217;s bestselling albums.</p>
<p>Of course, Billie Eilish wasn&#8217;t aware of any of this, as she was just 11 months old at the time.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why Billie was one of the stars who seemed less than blown away by Em&#8217;s surprise performance of the 8 Mile hit &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; at the <a href="/2020/02/2020-oscar-winners-who-got-totally-robbed/">2020 Academy Awards</a> on Sunday night.</p>
<p>You may have seen the above .GIF of an unenthused Eilish reacting to the rapper&#8217;s rousing rendition of his signature song.</p>
<p>To be clear, no one really knows how Billie felt about the performance, as she hasn&#8217;t offered any commentary on it <em>or</em> her viral moment.</p>
<p>And that wasn&#8217;t Billie&#8217;s only meme-worthy reaction shot of the night.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Here she is reacting to a Kristen Wiig-Maya Rudolph comedy segment that fell a bit flat.</p>
<p>This one also went semi-viral, and lots of folks seem to be under the impression that it was also a reaction to Em&#8217;s performance, but that&#8217;s what the kids these days call &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, Billie wasn&#8217;t the only star who seemed less than blown-away by Mr. Mathers&#8217; performance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Yup, there&#8217;s the legendary Martin Scorsese.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was just tired. More than likely, he was thinking about how he would probably rather be just about anywhere else in the world than front-and-center at the Dolby Theater.</p>
<p>Of course, both at home and in the crowd, many audience members were ecstatic to see Em &#8211; who famously skipped the Academy Awards the year this song was released &#8211; take the stage.</p>

<p>In fact, in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/what-was-your-favorite-oscars-2020-performances-vote-1278474?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;__twitter_impression=true">a poll</a> conducted by The Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; was ranked as the best-loved performance of the night, even edging out Janelle Monae&#8217;s high-energy opening number.</p>
<p>So what gives?</p>
<p>Why were some celebs so obviously bored, while others &#8211; like Zazie Beetz below &#8211; absolutely smitten by the throwback jam.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Well, it probably had little to do with the song itself, and much to do with Sunday night&#8217;s messy, marathon Oscars telecast.</p>
<p>It was the lowest-rated broadcast in the awards&#8217; 92-year history,</p>
<p>At just over three and a half hours, the ceremony achieved the dubious feat of lasting longer than the runtime of The Irishman.</p>
<p>Critics felt the decision to go host-less for the second year in a row was a mistake, and the evening was marred by a number of glitches.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kobe Bryant (above) was honored, but the&nbsp;<a href="/2020/02/luke-perry-left-out-of-oscars-in-memoriam-segment-fans-react-wit/">&quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment left out Luke Perry</a> and several other beloved stars.</p>
<p>And the singer for that segment?</p>
<p>You guessed it: Billie Eilish.</p>
<p>Maybe she was just grimacing at the thought of what she would be asked to do later &#8230;</p>
