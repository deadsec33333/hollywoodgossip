<p>Christine Brown would like to her set her romantic record straight.</p>



<p>And maybe have a laugh at your expense while she&#8217;s at it.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star, as you likely know well, walked away from spiritual spouse Kody Brown in November 2021 and married David Woolley about two years later.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Christine Brown and David Woolley." class="wp-image-511968" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy.jpg 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy-300x248.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy-768x636.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown has found her soulmate. His name is David Woolley.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine has gushed and gushed &#8212; and then gushed some more &#8212; about Woolley ever since, referring to him as her soulmate on more than one occasion.</p>



<p>“Every step of my journey brought me here,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">Brown captioned pictures</a> of the couple with their backs to the camera this past June, for example.</p>



<p>“Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.”</p>



<p>Despite all Christine and David have said about each other, the Internet is gonna Internet, you know?</p>



<p>By which we mean the following: Many folks out there think the couple is headed for a divorce.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-05-at-11.38.40%E2%80%AFAM-1024x661.png" alt="Christine Brown on TLC with David Woolley" class="wp-image-489677"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown gesture here at David Woolley during his first Sister Wives appearance.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a video posted to Instagram on February 12, the TLC personality shared a photo of herself posing and smiling, along with the onscreen message: </p>



<p>“When I read that David and I are not happy.”</p>



<p>The upload was followed by a series of short clips and images of the couple smiling and laughing together, hopefully putting split rumors to rest.</p>



<p>In case it didn&#8217;t do the job, however, Christine went ahead and assured her followers that all is well between the spouses in the caption of the post.</p>



<p>“I’m always surprised with what I read about myself,” the mother of six added. “Don’t you worry, we couldn’t be happier.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="901" height="686" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg 901w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-768x585.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown is all smiles in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s been clear for awhile now that Christine is full steam ahead.</p>



<p>She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/christine-brown-weight-loss-photos-look-im-down-40-pounds/">has lost 40 pounds</a> and she&#8217;s about to embark on a career as an author.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives cast member is coming out with an autobiography that will be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em>. </p>



<p>It has been described as &#8220;gritty and honest&#8221; by the star herself.</p>



<p>And its publisher has teased the book as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism — and the only life she’s known — behind.”</p>

<p>According to Amazon, the book will be available to purchase on September 16, 2025. Also according to Amazon, this is the official synopsis:</p>



<p><em>Becoming Kody Brown’s third wife in 1994, Christine finally found the big, happy family she had hoped for. When TLC’s hit show Sister Wives premiered in 2010, Christine knew it was her chance to shine a light on the brighter side of polygamy—the helping hands, the lively discussions, and their unmatched devotion to each other.</em></p>



<p><em>But the cameras also revealed a much darker truth.</em></p>



<p><em>In this candid tell-all, Christine shares for the first time the journey that led her away from the Morman church and the bold path she is carving to live apart from all she has ever known.</em></p>



<p><em>Moving, genuine, and insightful, this is a uniquely powerful tour de force of Christine’s journey toward and beyond her time in the spotlight as a sister wife.</em><br></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got it, you should flaunt it, right?</p>



<p>Or, when it comes to Christine Brown at the moment, if you <em>no longer have it</em>, you should go ahead and flaunt it, right?!?</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star has shed quite a lot of weight of late and took to Instagram this week in order to show off her new, impressive figure.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-12-at-4.07.34%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-519118"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown has lost 40 pounds. The Sister Wives star flaunts said weight loss here.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I’m down 40 pounds and feeling better than ever!&#8221; Brown captioned a montage of photos on February 10.</p>



<p>&#8220;What’s better, is that the weight actually has stayed off. No more yo-yo dieting, no more feeling drained—just real, lasting results. I finally have hunger control and the energy I was missing, and it feels amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Christine added:</p>



<p>&#8220;If you’re ready to take control of your health, join me for my next weight loss challenge! Drop RESET in the comments, and I’ll send you the details.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also used the hashtag #Plexus, which makes us sad.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/christine-brown-aims-to-empower-women-promotes-shady-supplement-business/">shady weight loss supplement</a> has not been approved by the FDA.</p>



<p>However, both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/janelle-brown-earns-prestigious-business-award-outpaces-bff-in-supplement-sales/">Christine and Janelle Brown have served as spokespeople</a> for the company, which many observers have compared in the past to an unfair pyramid scheme.</p>



<p>In general these days, Christine is all about evolving as a human being.</p>



<p>She dumped Kody Brown in November 2021 and married David Woolley in October 2023 and also wrote this week on social media:</p>



<p>&#8220;My journey shows that change is possible. If you feel confined by silence, know that every little step brings you closer to a brighter tomorrow. Let’s move forward together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine is clearly very happy with her decision to leave her selfish spouse.</p>



<p>She plans on sharing a great deal of insight about her life and her relationships in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christine-brown-tell-all-confirmed-how-concerned-should-kody-be/">an upcoming memoir</a>.</p>



<p>Theautobiography will be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em> and has been described by its publisher as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism — and the only life she’s known — behind.”</p>



<p>It will go on sale on September 16.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Christine Brown spoke out for the first time about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christine-brown-tell-all-confirmed-how-concerned-should-kody-be/">her upcoming memoir</a>, telling Instagram followers how they can preorder the book&#8230; prior to delving into what we can expect from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is gritty and honest as I tell my story living polygamy as a child, to my marriage and family life. It shows my heartache with leaving religion and my marriage to FINALLY meeting [<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley">David Woolley</a>],&#8221; Brown wrote as a caption to a number of photos of her in a red blazer.</p>



<p>One of the photos Christine posted will be used on the book&#8217;s cover, she teased.</p>



<p>Christine’s autobiography will be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em> and has been described by its publisher as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism — and the only life she’s known — behind.”</p>



<p>According to Amazon, it will be available to purchase on September 16, 2025.</p>

<p>Via this Instagram message, Christine explained that she worked with a writer, although every word in the book came out of her mouth.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I’m grateful to @simonandschuster for believing in my book and publishing it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kody Brown and Christine got spiritually married in 1994, but have never had any legal obligations to each other.</p>



<p>The latter walked away from her polygamous spouse in November 2021, claiming in subsequent interviews that Kody clearly favored wife Robyn and that he simply didn&#8217;t pay her enough attention.</p>

<p>Christine went on to marry Woolley in October 2023. She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-blasts-kody-hes-a-deadbeat-dad/">seems VERY happy these days</a> with these life choices.</p>



<p>“Christine’s decision to leave comes with a great deal of sadness,” Kody wrote three-plus years ago after Christine confirmed she was done with him.</p>



<p>“We enjoyed many years together and I have a large amount of respect and admiration for her. Although we are moving forward on different paths, we will always remain committed parents.”</p>



<p>From what we can gather, the former spouses no longer have any contact.</p>

<p>Note to Kody Brown: You may wanna sign off the Internet in the near future.</p>



<p>Heck, you may wanna go live under a rock for a number of years.</p>



<p>In a seismic announcement made by our friends today at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, we&#8217;ve learned that <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/01/29/exclusive-sister-wives-star-christine-brown-has-written-a-tell-all-book-get-all-the-details/">Christine Brown has</a> ALREADY WRITTEN A MEMOIR.</p>



<p>This celebrity gossip website reports that the book will come out in the fall &#8212; and will chronicle Christine&#8217;s many years as part of Kody Brown&#8217;s polygamous family unit.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="901" height="686" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg 901w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-768x585.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown is all smiles in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine was the first sister wife to leave this situation, telling the public in November 2021 that she was done with Kody.</p>



<p>About two years later, Christine walked down the aisle with David Woolley and has spent a great deal of her time <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-blasts-kody-hes-a-deadbeat-dad/">trashing Kody in a variety</a> of interviews and features.</p>



<p>Christine’s autobiography will allegedly be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em> and has been described by its publisher as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism &#8212; and the only life she’s known &#8212; behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kody and Christine got spiritually married in 1994, but have never had any legal obligations to each other.</p>

<p>“Christine’s decision to leave comes with a great deal of sadness,” Kody wrote back after Christine confirmed she was done with him. </p>



<p>“We enjoyed many years together and I have a large amount of respect and admiration for her. Although we are moving forward on different paths, we will always remain committed parents.”</p>



<p>From what we can gather, the exes no longer have any contact.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/christine-brown-lawsuit-against-kody-deemed-significant-custody-dispute-by-court/">Christine recently sued Kody for child support</a> in regard to their 14-year old daughter.</p>

<p>A search on Amazon, meanwhile, reveals that Christine&#8217;s memoir will go on sale in September.</p>



<p>The description on this platform reads as follows:</p>



<p><em>Becoming Kody Brown’s third wife in 1994, Christine finally found the big, happy family she had hoped for. When TLC’s hit show Sister Wives premiered in 2010, Christine knew it was her chance to shine a light on the brighter side of polygamy—the helping hands, the lively discussions, and their unmatched devotion to each other. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>But the cameras also revealed a much darker truth.</strong></em></p>



<p><em>In this candid tell-all, Christine shares for the first time the journey that led her away from the Morman church and the bold path she is carving to live apart from all she has ever known.</em></p>



<p><em>Moving, genuine, and insightful, this is a uniquely powerful tour de force of Christine’s journey toward and beyond her time in the spotlight as a sister wife.</em></p>

<p>Back in 2013, Christine, Kody, Meri, Janelle and Robyn Brown came together to pen Becoming Sister Wives, a book that told the story of how these sister wives came to be a family.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d have to assume Christine&#8217;s upcoming memoir will be rather critical of such a lifestyle.</p>



<p>The same can be said for Meri&#8217;s eventual tell-all, which this fellow reality star teased last month on TikTok, stating for fans:</p>



<p>“I think they’re wanting to hear the ugly and the nitty gritty and the mean and they want me to throw people under the bus and I’m not going to do that&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re going to get my truth and there are going to be things that will be painful. Yes, people love the drama&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;There will be things that I have no doubt that, when some of my family members read it, will be painful for them but it will be my truth…I might talk pain and experience and what did I learn from it…so that’s how I tell my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine Brown has made it very clear for a very long time now:</p>



<p>She is done with Kody Brown.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star walked away from that unhealthy relationship in November 2021 and later married <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley">David Woolley</a> and has not looked back since.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the thing, you guys&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="362" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg" alt="Christine Brown smirks" class="wp-image-508556" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown smirks in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine is done with a couple other people who were once in her close circle, as well.</p>



<p>“I haven’t talked to Meri or Robyn for years, and it’s funny,” Brown said on a recent episode of iHeart’s Rogue Energy podcast. “We’ll just keep it like that. I don’t need to develop a relationship with them.”</p>



<p>The mother of six added that one of the benefits of getting older is that you can decide who you want in your life without much concern or anxiety. </p>



<p>For example? How she didn’t feel bad about not inviting Meri and Robyn to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-snubs-her-sister-wives-no-wedding-invite-for-you/">her wedding to Woolley</a> in October 2023.</p>

<p>“A great thing about being older when you married is that you really only have to invite the people you really want there,” Christine explained on this podcast. </p>



<p>“There’s no obligatory invitations that go out to some Uncle Bob or Uncle Jed, but you’re like, ‘I really don’t want him there. He’s gonna blah, blah, blah. He always this blah, blah, blah.’ We didn’t have to.”</p>



<p>In simple terms?</p>



<p>Christine is living her own, independent life. She isn&#8217;t part of any polygamous unit any longer. And she&#8217;s loving this freedom!</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t exactly been a secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/christine-and-meri-sister-wives-friendship/">Christine doesn&#8217;t talk to Meri</a>.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been extremely candid for years now, too, in the way she feels about Robyn &#8212; specifically how Kody has showed such clear favoritism toward her and how this.</p>



<p>“I don’t trust her,” Christine previously said a Sister Wives one-on-one special, referring to Robyn.</p>



<p>“I think she says one thing but does another. How can you say you want the whole big family picture, but then do all these separate things with Kody?</p>



<p>“How can you say you want the whole big family picture when he’s over at your house all the time?”</p>

<p>For the record, Kody is legally married to Robyn and now only married to Robyn overall.</p>



<p>After Christine left him, Janelle Brown also ditched the father of 17 and Meri followed suit in January 2023.</p>



<p>All three women seem much better off at this point, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>

<p>We have an update on Christine Brown suing her ex-husband for child support.</p>



<p>Back in September, we reported that the 52-year old had filed legal documents against the Sister Wives patriarch in which she asked a court to establish paternity of 14-year old daughter Truly because Kody Brown&#8217;s name is not on her birth certificate.</p>

<p>Additionally, Christine has requested a domestic relations injunction that stops both parties from harassment, domestic violence, canceling or modifying services, taking the kids for non-routine travel without court orders or permission and demeaning or disparaging the other party.</p>



<p>Last Wednesday, meanwhile, the exes met in court (via Zoom) for a hearing in regard to this case.</p>



<p>According to court documents obtained by our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Realty Roundup, both sides <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/12/21/exclusive-hearing-held-for-christine-browns-lawsuit-against-ex-kody-brown-sister-wives-stars-case-classified-as-a-significant-custody-dispute/">completed their disclosures</a> for the case at the time and that the exes have now been ordered to attend a mediation conference scheduled for May 21, 2025.</p>



<p>Now, here is where it gets interesting&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="362" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg" alt="Christine Brown smirks" class="wp-image-508556" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown smirks in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The court apparently classified Kody and Christine’s case as having Track 3 status, which is an assignment reserved for a “significant custody dispute.”</p>



<p>Consider the following section from the Utah State Courts website, </p>



<p><em>This category includes cases with significant custody disputes, including custody disputes involving allegations of child abuse or domestic violence. For a Track 3 case, at the case management conference the court and parties will address: </em></p>



<p><em>1) whether a custody evaluation is necessary, and, if so, the form of the evaluation and appointment considerations; and 2) whether appointment of a private guardian ad litem is necessary, and if so, the scope of the appointment and apportionment of costs.</em></p>

<p>To be clear, we are not legal experts.</p>



<p>From what we understand, there have been no allegations of child abuse or domestic violence.</p>



<p>Rather, because Christine and Kody&#8217;s marriage was not legal in nature and because Kody is not listed on the aforementioned birth certificate&#8230; Christine cannot make any requests legally binding without this lawsuit/process.</p>



<p>After Christine’s walked away from Kody in November 2021, Truely moved with her mother from Arizona to Utah.</p>



<p>It sounds in our opinion here as if Christine wants to force Kody to actually leave his home in order to see his daughter&#8230; and <em>not</em> be forced on her end to send the teenager to Arizona out of any parental obligation.</p>

<p>Kody and Christine also share children Mykelti, Aspyn, Gwendlyn, Ysabel and Paedon; only Truely is a minor, however.</p>



<p>“When I lived in Flagstaff, I firmly believed that moving to Utah was the best choice for me and for Truely,” Christine explained during a previous episode of Sister Wives.</p>



<p>“I knew that I was taking Truely away from her dad. I felt like the best way to preserve Truely’s relationship with Kody was to move her away from him&#8230;</p>



<p>“I took their relationship while it was still good and I picked it up and I moved it. And then whenever we come back into town, I just pick it up again and I move it back.”</p>

<p>Kody doesn’t seem especially close to his children.</p>



<p>The father of 17&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sister-wives-kody-brown-garrison-death/">wasn’t even talking to son Garrison</a>&nbsp;when the 25-year old committed suicide this past March.</p>



<p>Kody also trashed his ex-wife’s reasoning behind moving away with their teenager via a Sister Wives confessional last autumn.</p>



<p>“For Christine to think that she’s saving my relationship with Truely by taking her away from me and just ‘preserving’ it — that’s such B.S. rationalization,” Kody said on air, emphasizing that the situation was “ridiculous.”</p>



<p>He has not yet responded in public to Christine’s recent lawsuit.</p>

<p>At last.</p>



<p>Just over a year since they became husband and wife, David Woolley and Christine Brown finally embarked several days on a trip to honor this occasion.</p>



<p>Yes, they went on a honeymoon.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="393" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/sisterwives5-768x393-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513285" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/sisterwives5-768x393-1.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/sisterwives5-768x393-1-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley appear here on Sister Wives Season 19.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Sister Wives cast members very recently visited a number of European destinations &#8212; including Barcelona, Spain, and Florence, Italy via a Virgin Voyages Cruise.</p>



<p>And it sure sounds like a grand time was had by all.</p>



<p>“We are finally on our honeymoon!!” Brown wrote on Instagram on November 4, sharing footage of the couple&#8217;s travels&#8230; including a trip to the famous Sagrada Familia. </p>



<p>“Yep, a year later, we just decided to take our time and go when we were ready. We LOVE Barcelona! The architecture, food and people!!”</p>

<p>Brown and Woolley exchanged vows in Moab, Utah in October 2023.</p>



<p>The former, of course, was in a relationship with Kody Brown for well over two decades prior to walking away from the self-centered polygamist in late 2021.</p>



<p>She has pretty much gushed over Woolley ever since the two got together, often referring to him <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">as her soulmate and her forever love</a>.</p>



<p>In a photo uploaded to Instagram in June, the 52-year old shared a snapshot of herself and her husband enjoying a quiet evening while watching the sunset.</p>



<p>“Every step of my journey brought me here,” Brown captioned pictures of the couple with their backs to the camera.</p>



<p>“Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.”</p>

<p>“I have been craving a trip to Florence since I watched the 1985 A Room with A View #dreamcometrue #florence #duomo #virginvoyages #honeymoon #needtogoback.”</p>

<p>When four become one, the question remains, who can stay friends in the ex-wives club? Specifically, Meri and Christine &#8211; the first and third wife. </p>



<p>The <em>Sisters Wives</em> stars were once, well, sister wives. They both married Kody Brown and had children with him.</p>

<p>Meri Brown spoke on the June 10, 2024 episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB5Ns2Lc-Ig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Miss Understood</em> podcast</a>. The <em>Sister Wives </em>star opened up about how she doesn&#8217;t speak with Christine, Janelle, or Robyn nearly as much as she once did.</p>



<p>“When I see them we have cordial conversations, but I don&#8217;t seek them out to have a relationship,” she described.</p>



<p>“I feel like we had a lot of time to be able to do that, and in the past &#8212; a little bit over a year since I separated myself, when Kody and I separated and were done,&#8221; Meri remarked. &#8220;I’ve had a lot of things I’m working on in myself.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s really really important to be surrounded by the people that really encourage that,&#8221; Meri Brown then expressed.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s taken me a little bit to realize and just come to the understanding that it&#8217;s okay,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;Sometimes people are just in your life for a season.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meri continued: &#8220;And it&#8217;s okay to let things go if the relationship is not reciprocal. And it&#8217;s not building me up or building them up &#8212; that goes for him, it goes for my sister wives. It goes for anyone in my life.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-state-of-meri-and-christine-brown-s-friendship-according-to-christine">What is the state of Meri and Christine Brown&#8217;s friendship according to Christine?</h2>



<p>In a late 2022 conversation on Sister Wives, Christine Brown shared her stance on her fallen friendship with Meri. And she delved into why she believes that Meri felt betrayed.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cause I ended the friendship. I ended the relationship, I did. I ended it,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>



<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t safe for me anymore and I ended it,&#8221; Christine reiterated. &#8220;And I just told her straight up, &#8216;No, we’re not going to be friends cause I don&#8217;t trust you and I&#8217;m not gonna do that to myself anymore.'&#8221;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Christine explained that, for her, the relationship felt beyond repair.</p>



<p>&#8220;We tried a little bit here and there in Vegas but her treatment of me wasn&#8217;t nice. She wouldn&#8217;t be nice to me,&#8221; she lamented. </p>



<p>Christine described: &#8220;She was just putting me down a lot in public situations. Especially if her family was there she would just put me down. &#8230; When I hit my wall, I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-there-any-coming-back-from-this">Is there any coming back from this?</h2>



<p>If Christine Brown and Meri Brown&#8217;s friendship ended while the <em>Sister Wives </em>stars were still sister wives, it seems unlikely to get better now. They&#8217;re no longer married to Kody. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine has moved on</a> and found her happiness.</p>



<p>Every now and then, two people who didn&#8217;t get along when they were in close quarters will reconnect and mesh well after the fact. Hypothetically, Meri and Christine could see their <em>Sister Wives</em> friendship rekindle if they tried. In theory.</p>



<p>But, as Meri said, sometimes people are only in your life for a &#8220;season.&#8221; It was a long season for the two of them, but maybe that&#8217;s all.</p>

<p>As previously reported, Christine sued her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/christine-brown-sues-ex-husband-kody-for-child-support-custody/">ex-spouse in September for child support</a> and also for custody of the former couple&#8217;s 14-year old daughter Truley.</p>



<p>She also asked for a paternity test because Kody is NOT listed on the teenager&#8217;s birth certificate for some reason.</p>



<p>Kody and Christine also share children Mykelti, Aspyn, Gwendlyn, Ysabel and Paedon; only Truely is a minor, though.</p>



<p>“When I lived in Flagstaff, I firmly believed that moving to Utah was the best choice for me and for Truely,” Christine explained during a previous episode of Sister Wives.</p>



<p>“I knew that I was taking Truely away from her dad. I felt like the best way to preserve Truely’s relationship with Kody was to move her away from him.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="362" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg" alt="Christine Brown smirks" class="wp-image-508556" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown smirks in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kody is not very close to any of his children.</p>



<p>Still, Kody filed a response to Christine&#8217;s lawsuit last month and now The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup has confirmed that <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/10/29/exclusive-kody-conference-cant-be-filmed-for-sister-wives/">Christine and Kody will both</a> be required to attend a case management conference as the next step in this case, which has been set for December 18 in Utah.</p>



<p>They can attend the hearing virtually, however.</p>



<p>“Court proceedings, including electronic proceedings, may not be recorded, photographed or transmitted,” the court documents state, meaning nothing from this court date will be featured on Sister Wives. </p>



<p>“Failure to comply with this prohibition may be treated as contempt of court, punishable by fine and time in jail.”</p>

<p>The information contained in Kody’s counter claim has been marked “not public” and is therefore not able to be viewed by anyone other than the courts, Kody and Christine and their legal teams.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d have to assume he doesn&#8217;t want to pay child support, though, and also that he wants to have designed times during which Truely can come stay with him or visit with him in Arizona.</p>



<p>We could also be wrong, of course.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t someone who comes across as an especially caring father. Or an especially caring human being in general.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-1.45.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x550.png" alt="Kody Brown angry" class="wp-image-510889"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown can&#8217;t hide his anger over his children on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While appearing on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy program a short time, Christine was asked to list three words to describe Kody.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-blasts-kody-hes-a-deadbeat-dad/">Deadbeat dad</a>,” Brown said for starters. “Sorry, that’s two, but that can be two. Deadbeat dad and … oblivious.”</p>



<p>In her September filing, Christine requested a domestic relations injunction that prevents both her and Kody from harassment, domestic violence, canceling or modifying services, taking the kids for non-routine travel without court orders or permission and demeaning or disparaging the other party.</p>



<p>Simply put, we hope she gets what she wants.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, Sister Wives flashed way back for viewers.</p>



<p>And give us a glimpse in the process of just what Christine Brown was thinking shortly before agreeing to marry now-husband David Woolley.</p>

<p>The most recent season of this TLC reality show was filmed more than two years ago, making it a tad bit jarring because just SO much has happened since the early fall of 2022.</p>



<p>For example&#8230; Christine exchanged vows with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a>!</p>



<p>On Sunday night&#8217;s episode of Sister Wives, Christine and David talked about the prospect of their nuptials &#8212; despite not technically being engaged at the time.</p>



<p>“We’ll invite Janelle to our wedding, Janelle’s kids,” Christine said of her close pal and her children. “Leon, for sure, Meri’s child. I am not ready to be around Meri and Robyn and Kody yet.”</p>



<p>Indeed, neither Meri nor Robyn nor Kody earned an invite to Christine&#8217;s big day.</p>

<p>The spouses got married in Moab, Utah in October 2023&#8230; with Janelle and the majority of their children present. </p>



<p>They only just celebrated their first wedding anniversary, with Brown telling E! News they have a major trip planned.</p>



<p>“We’re finally going on our honeymoon,” Christine told this outlet. “We’re leaving on November 1.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see the photos!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been made clear for a very long time now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/christine-and-janelle-brown-were-sister-wives-for-life/">Christine and Janelle are best friends</a>, while it&#8217;s also evident that the two scarcely talk to anyone else from their former polygamous family.</p>



<p>“I’ve heard rumors about Christine dating,” Kody actually said in a confessional on Sunday evening. </p>



<p>“I’ve heard rumors that he’s Christine’s soulmate. She’s very excited about the relationship. I’m offended for her on the idea that she’d be stuck with me for eternity when her soulmate was out there to be found.”</p>



<p>Christine and Woolley <em>do</em> seem very happy &#8212; and Christine has definitely said that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">Woolley is her forever love</a>, not Kody.</p>

<p>“We’re thinking minimum of 350,” Christine told one venue coordinator of her head count on Sister Wives, noting that if she were to really invite all of David and her family members, she’d need to send out 700 invitations. </p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-family-polygamy-royalty/">We have really big families</a>. I have six kids, but we have 18 kids all together in my family and then David.”</p>



<p>Woolley said on air that he&#8217;d be content with a quick ceremony in Las Vegas. But that he was open to anything that made Brown happy.</p>



<p>“Christine deserves to have a nice, big wedding she never had,” David said in a joint confessional with his future bride. &#8220;And that’s the thing I want to give to her, even though it would be cheaper to go to Vegas.”</p>



<p><strong>Sister Wives Season 19 airs on Sunday nights at 10/9c on TLC.</strong></p>
