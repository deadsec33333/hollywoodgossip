<p>It&#8217;s pretty darn good to be Lady Gaga right about now.</p>



<p>The singer&#8217;s epic year began when she blew the doors and monuments off of Paris, France while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/celine-dion-paris-performance/">performing at the opening ceremony</a> of the 2024 Summer Olympics in July.</p>



<p>And earlier this month, she released a new album, Mayhem, which some critics are calling the best of her career.</p>



<p>And the pop icon&#8217;s love life is taking off like never before, too!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lady-gaga-is-engaged-to-michael-polansky">Lady Gaga is engaged to Michael Polansky!</h2>



<p>We first learned of this major development from a a TikTok video posted by French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on July 28, in which Gage could be heard introducing Polansky as &#8220;my fiancé&#8221; as the trio watched a swimming event together.</p>



<p>Attal shared footage of the conversation on his official social media account, captioning it as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you Lady Gaga for your stunning performance at the opening ceremony. It was breathtaking.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lady Gaga at the opening ceremony" class="wp-image-504893" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163836315.jpg 1764w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lady Gaga at the Sully bridge area before the opening ceremony during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 on July 26, 2024 in Paris, France. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin C.

<p>The 38-year-old superstar &#8212; who performed a cover of French singer Zizi Jeanmaire&#8217;s &#8220;Mon Truc En Plumes&#8221; on July 26 to help get the Olympics underway &#8212; first sparked engagement rumors in April when she stepped out wearing a large diamond ring on her left ring finger.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also been talk here and there since of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/lady-gaga-pregnant-answers/">Lady Gaga being pregnant</a>.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s important to note that there&#8217;s very little evidence to support that rumor.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="677" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-1024x677.jpg" alt="Lady Gaga filming The Joker" class="wp-image-504894" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-768x508.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-2048x1354.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-960x635.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-1080x714.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1249407793-1200x793.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lady Gaga performs during the filming of the movie &#8220;Joker: Folie Ã  Deux&#8221; in New York on March 25, 2023. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gaga and Polansky, meanwhile, were initially romantically linked way back in 2020 when they were photographed kissing at a New Year&#8217;s Eve party in Las Vegas. </p>



<p>Mere weeks later, they went public with their relationship during a PDA-filled weekend in Miami for that year&#8217;s Super Bowl.</p>



<p>Polansky is a tech investor of some kind, but not a ton is known about him.</p>



<p>He and his famous fiancee have said very little overall about their romance ever since making it official all that time ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-683x1024.jpg" alt="Lady Gaga on a red carpet" class="wp-image-504895" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1473084257-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lady Gaga attends the 95th Annual Academy Awards on March 12, 2023 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2021, however, Gaga spoke to the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> about the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/lady-gaga-dognapping-911-audio-released-help-me-ive-been-shot/">truly awful attack on her French bulldogs</a> and dog walker, saying to this publication at the time:</p>



<p>&#8220;Every day I thank God for the safe return of my dogs. My dogs and the man that I love are my whole life.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to engagement speculation that seems to have been confirmed, Gaga had faced pregnancy rumors in June when she was seen with Michael at her sister&#8217;s wedding, as mentioned above.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not pregnant,&#8221; Gaga wrote on TikTok at the time, quoting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> and making herself even more awesome by adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;Just down bad crying at the gym.&#8221;</p>



<p>Anyway, congrats to the Mother Monster and her new man on their upcoming nuptials!</p>

<p>Is Lady Gaga pregnant?</p>



<p>In the past, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/03/lady-gaga-poses-nude-reveals-troubling-medical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga has shared troubling health news</a> with fans. It is not unreasonable that some hoped that she might have a more positive announcement for the world.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, some busybodies (well-intentioned or otherwise) thought they spied a possible baby bump.</p>



<p>Now, Lady Gaga herself is responding &#8211; with Taylor Swift&#8217;s help!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-1024x682.jpg" alt="Lady Gaga in March of 2023." class="wp-image-501282" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lady Gaga attends the 95th Annual Academy Awards on March 12, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-lady-gaga-pregnant">Is Lady Gaga pregnant?</h2>



<p>Late on Tuesday, June 4, the incomparable Lady Gaga took to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladygaga/video/7376784960625085742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> to address fans.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t hesitate to delve directly into the pregnancy rumors that had emerged.</p>



<p>“Not pregnant,” she began &#8212; not even touching upon the speculation before debunking it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladygaga/video/7376784960625085742" data-video-id="7376784960625085742" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@ladygaga" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladygaga?refer=embed">@ladygaga</a> <p>register to vote or check if you&#8217;re registered EASILY at www.headcount.org   </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ I AM THE AESTHETIC _yaesthetician - yas 💚🌻🍭🫧" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/I-AM-THE-AESTHETIC-yaesthetician-7030258448466037510?refer=embed">♬ I AM THE AESTHETIC _yaesthetician &#8211; yas 💚🌻🍭🫧</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Instead, the phenomenal musician explained, she was: “Just down bad cryin&#8217; at the gym.&#8221;</p>



<p>If you didn&#8217;t catch the reference, Lady Gaga was pulling from the lyrics to &#8220;Down Bad&#8221; from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-album-shatters-record-proves-she-is-really-pretty-popular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift&#8217;s <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> album</a>.</p>



<p>Within the video itself, Lady Gaga flashed a smile. Despite her makeup, she definitely looked dress for the gym.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lady Gaga in April of 2022." class="wp-image-501283" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0605_ladygaga_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lady Gaga performs onstage during the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards at MGM Grand Garden Arena on April 03, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rich Fury/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-baby-bump-speculation-can-so-easily-be-body-shaming">&#8216;Baby bump&#8217; speculation can so easily be body-shaming</h2>



<p>TikTok commenters flooded Lady Gaga&#8217;s replies with reassurances and affirmations.</p>



<p>“People can be so mean. You are gorgeous Gaga. We love you!” assured one commenter.</p>



<p>Another accurately described the singer, writing: &#8220;You are perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not all speculation is harmful. In fact, many celebrities &#8212; including Lady Gaga &#8212; have and continue to use fan speculation as a positive PR strategy.</p>



<p>For example, amidst the hurtful &#8220;baby bump&#8221; buzz, fans also spied Lady Gaga&#8217;s large diamond ring. This fueled speculation about a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/lady-gaga-and-michael-polansky-officially-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky</a> engagement, though this remains unconfirmed.</p>



<p>But whispers about a relationship status getting a little more serious are a far cry from discussing someone&#8217;s body. We all hate to think that press coverage of Gaga&#8217;s visit to sister Natali Germonotta&#8217;s rehearsal dinner prompted the singer to feel that she needed to change her body.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-lady-gaga-and-michael-polansky-engaged">Are Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky engaged?</h2>



<p>Though Gaga was quick to address the pregnancy rumors, neither she nor Polansky have confirmed (or denied) whether they are currently engaged.</p>



<p>However, the two first became romantically linked in the public eye back in early 2020. </p>



<p>Gaga has had two engagements in the past. Neither worked out. Fans hope that, no matter her relationship status at the moment, that the beloved talent can find happiness.</p>

<p>Lady Gaga is no stranger to making <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/06/lady-gaga-destroys-donald-trump-what-a-dangerous-racist-fool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sensible political statements</a>. Her TikTok debunking the baby bump rumors was no exception.</p>



<p>She followed up her clarification by writing: &#8220;Register to vote at <a href="https://www.headcount.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.headcount.org</a>&#8221; on her video.</p>



<p>2024 is an election year. While it would be so nice for there to be an election year that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; that has yet to happen in any of our lifetimes. Gaga is right: we all have to do our part.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-defends-lady-gaga-over-irresponsible-pregnant-rumors">Taylor Swift Defends Lady Gaga Over &#8216;Irresponsible&#8217; Pregnant Rumors</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C71zECtRAzZ/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> bloggers quickly documented, Taylor Swift chimed in to discuss the creepy fixation on Lady Gaga&#8217;s body that led to this reaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can we all agree that it&#8217;s invasive &amp; irresponsible to comment on a woman&#8217;s body,&#8221; Taylor Swift wrote. &#8220;Gaga doesn&#8217;t owe anyone an explanation &amp; neither does any woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>She&#8217;s very correct. Whether or not a person is actually pregnant, it&#8217;s unclear why people feel the need to speculate. And it&#8217;s even worse than many feel entitled to answers. Enough is enough.</p>

<p>But at Sunday night&#8217;s ceremony, the beloved band was not present to collect their trophies for Best Rock Performance, Best Rock Song, and Best Rock Album.</p>
<p>The reason for their absence, of course, was the death of Taylor Hawkins.</p>
<p>The drummer passed away last month while the band was on tour in Colombia.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While the <a href="/2022/03/taylor-hawkins-cause-of-death-revealed/">cause of Hawkins&#8217; death</a> remains uncertain, investigators say they found at least 10 illicit substances in his bloodstream, including opioids and alcohol.</p>
<p>Grammys host Trevor Noah paused to pay tribute to Hawkins during last night&#8217;s broadcast.</p>
<p>&quot;This was the moment in the show when I was supposed to be introducing the Foo Fighters,&quot; he told the audience.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">

<p>&quot;We would have been celebrating with them as they won three Grammy awards earlier today. But they are of course not here because of the tragic passing of their legendary drummer Taylor Hawkins,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Our thoughts go out to Taylor&#8217;s family, his friends, the Foo Fighter family and all of their fans around the globe. We&#8217;d like to take a moment now to remember Taylor.&quot;</p>
<p>Several artists paid tribute to Hawkins throughout the night, including Billie Eilish who wore a t-shirt emblazoned with Hawkins&#8217; likeness during her performance.</p>

<p>Appearing on Lady Gaga Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry&#8217;s new Apple TV+ docuseries, The Me You Can&#8217;t See, the singer delves deeply into her ongoing mental health struggles.</p>
<p>Specifically, she talks in detail about the time she was sexually assaulted as a young woman.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I was 19 years old, and I was working in the business, and a producer said to me, &#8216;Take your clothes off,&#8217; &quot; the superstar says through years on her episode.</p>
<p>&quot;And I said no. And I left, and they told me they were going to burn all of my music. And they didn&#8217;t stop.</p>
<p>&quot;They didn&#8217;t stop asking me, and I just froze and I just &#8212; I don&#8217;t even remember.&quot;</p>
<p>Gaga proceeded to explain that she has decided <em>not</em> to name her abuser because she does &quot;not ever want to face that person again.&quot;</p>

<p>The singer didn&#8217;t stop there, however.</p>
<p>The Grammy award winner outlined a time years later when she went to a hospital to seek assistance for the pain and numbness she was experiencing.</p>
<p>&quot;First I felt full-on pain, then I went numb,&quot; Gaga revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;And then I was sick for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks after, and I realized that it was the same pain that I felt when the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on a corner at my parents&#8217; house because I was vomiting and sick.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I&#8217;d been being abused. I was locked away in a studio for months.&quot;</p>

<p>Lady Gaga has brought up this assault before.</p>
<p>But never in such detail.</p>
<p>And she has never previously divulged that her rapist got her pregnant.</p>

<p>The artist went on to admit she suffered a &quot;psychological break&quot; at some point after the incident, saying on air:</p>
<p>&quot;For a couple years, I was not the same girl.</p>
<p>&#8216;The way that I feel when I feel pain was how I felt after I was raped. I&#8217;ve had so many MRIs and scans where they don&#8217;t find nothing. But your body remembers.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn&#8217;t feel anything, I disassociated. It&#8217;s like your brain goes offline.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Added Gaga, who has also admitted in the past <a href="/2018/06/lady-gaga-suicidal-thoughts-have-haunted-me-for-years/">to having suicidal thoughts</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a really very real thing to feel like there&#8217;s a black cloud that is following you wherever you go, telling you that you&#8217;re worthless and should die.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to scream and throw myself against the wall.&quot;</p>
<p>She isn&#8217;t all the way healed, either.</p>

<p>She revealed on this docuseries that she has self-harmed &#8212; recently.</p>
<p>&quot;You know why it&#8217;s not good to self-harm? Because it makes you feel worse,&quot; Gaga said.</p>
<p>&quot;You think you&#8217;re gonna feel better &#8217;cause you&#8217;re showing somebody, &#8216;Hey, look, I&#8217;m in pain.&#8217; It doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>&quot;I always tell people, &#8216;Tell somebody, don&#8217;t show somebody.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Harry is also featured on this program, discussing what it was like when <a href="/2021/05/prince-harry-reveals-the-reason-why-meghan-markle-didnt-kill-her/">Meghan Markle thought about killing herself</a>.</p>
<p>Back to Lady Gaga, though.</p>
<p>She says that recovery from her trauma is ongoing process, saying that &quot;even if I have six brilliant months, all it takes is getting triggered once to feel bad, and when I say feel bad, I mean, wanna cut, think about dying.&quot;</p>

<p>In conclusion, the star shared some words of wisdom anyone who is suffering, noting that it is crucial to find &quot;one person who validates you&quot; and stating:</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody thinks [healing] is a straight line, that it&#8217;s just like every other virus.</p>
<p>&quot;That you get sick and then you get cured. But it&#8217;s not like that, it&#8217;s just not like that.&quot;</p>

<p>On Friday, February 26, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to NBC News and other outlets that the singer&#8217;s dogs have been discovered.</p>
<p>According to these authorities, the canines were returned at approximately 6 p.m. yesterday after a woman brought the unharmed pets to the Olympic Community Police Station.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Just two days earlier, <a href="/2021/02/lady-gaga-dog-walker-shot-bulldogs-stolen-in-shocking-robbery/">an armed robber shot Lady Gaga&#8217;s dog walker</a>&nbsp;in the chest and actually took two of her French Bulldogs,&nbsp;Koji and Gustav.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, not long before receiving this good enws, the 34-year-old singer &#8212; who was in Rome filming the forthcoming movie Gucci when the violent attack took place &#8212; spoke out on social media with a statement.</p>
<p>It included a photo of the bulldogs and it opened:</p>
<p>&quot;My beloved dogs Koji and Gustav were taken in Hollywood two nights ago. My heart is sick and I am praying my family will be whole again with an act of kindness.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I will pay $500,000 for their safe return,&quot; Gaga continued, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Email KojiandGustav@gmail.com to contact us. Or, if you bought or found them unknowingly, the reward is the same.&quot;</p>
<p>No word yet on whether the woman who brought the dogs in will be paid this amount.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Gaga also expressed gratitude to her dog walker on Friday, writing:</p>
<p>&quot;I continue to love you Ryan Fischer, you risked your life to fight for our family. You&#8217;re forever a hero.&quot;</p>
<p>Fischer&#8217;s family, meanwhile, released a statement of their own on Friday, thanking his medical team for the &quot;extraordinary care,&quot; as well as Lady Gaga for her ongoing support.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Read the message:</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot possibly say enough to thank all of the first responders, nurses and doctors who have worked so tirelessly to care for Ryan.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, we also want to thank Lady Gaga who has shown nothing but non-stop love and concern for Ryan and our family right from the outset.</p>
<p>&quot;Ryan loves Gustavo and Koji as much as Lady Gaga does; so we join in her plea for their safe return.&quot;</p>

<p>Los Angeles Police Captain Jonathan Tippet told journalists that Fischer was shot one time in the chest and is in stable condition in the hospital.</p>
<p>When asked if Fischer will make a full recovery, Tippet replied: &quot;I believe he will.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite no suspects having yet been apprehended in this dognapping case, we&#8217;re grateful this story mostly has a happy ending.</p>
<p>Are you ready for <em>ALL</em> the belly rubs,&nbsp;Koji and Gustav?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Lady Gaga was one of the victims of a horrible, violent crime.</p>
<p>Armed, dangerous criminals&nbsp;<a href="/2021/02/lady-gaga-dog-walker-shot-bulldogs-stolen-in-shocking-robbery/">dognapped two of her dogs and shot her dog walker</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we know new, grisly details of the crime scene.</p>
<p>And the 911 recording has been released.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This is a horrific crime including, first and foremost, the shooting of a man who fought heroically to protect his charges.</p>
<p>Ryan Fischer is now in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery, but he was shot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two of Gaga&#8217;s dogs, Gustav and Koji, were victims of a dognapping.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We have included the 911 recording in this post.</p>
<p>It was made by a concerned citizen who was aware of the shooting after it took place.</p>
<p>But we now know a play-by-play of the actual assault and dognapping, thanks to <em>TMZ</em>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/02/25/lady-gaga-dog-walker-french-bulldogs-stolen-video-surveillance/"><em>TMZ</em></a>&nbsp;got a look at security footage from the neighhorhood where this horrible crime took place.</p>
<p>The dog walker, Ryan Fischer, was seen walking with Lady Gaga&#8217;s dogs, Gustav, Koji, and Miss Asia.</p>
<p>This was around 9:40pm on Wednesday night, not an uncommon time of day for dogs to get a final walk before bed.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This was when a white, four-door sedan pulled up alongside Fischer and the three Frenchies.</p>
<p>&quot;Give it up!&quot; yelled one of two men who burst out of the vehicle and attacked Fischer.</p>
<p>&quot;No! Help me!&quot; Fischer screamed into the night, as he wrestled with the attackers who tried to wrangle the dogs from him.</p>

<p>Fischer heroically refused to let go of the dogs.</p>
<p>At this point, one of the two monsters produced a semiautomatic handgun.</p>
<p>The criminal then fired a single shot into Fischer, leaving him splayed out and bleeding on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The criminals were then able to abduct Gustav and Koji, two of Lady Gaga&#8217;s beloved dogs.</p>
<p>Leaving Miss Asia behind &#8212; possibly because they knew that the struggle and gunshot would draw attention &#8212; they fled.</p>
<p>Fischer was injured but conscious, and began to call for help.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my God, help me!&quot; he yelled out in the neighborhood. &quot;Help me, I&#8217;ve been shot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m bleeding out of my chest,&quot; Fischer cried out.</p>
<p>At this point, locals from the neighborhood had emerged from their homes.</p>

<p>Multiple locals rushed to Fischer&#8217;s aid, and one could be heard calling 911.</p>
<p>&quot;They stole two dogs,&quot; Fischer, who must have been wondering if he would live, told those who responded.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#8217;re Frenchies,&quot; his description continued. &quot;They&#8217;re Lady Gaga&#8217;s dogs.&quot;</p>

<p>With first responders arriving, these neighbors handed Fischer over to paramedics, who rushed Fischer to a local hospital.</p>
<p>Though he had been shot in the chest, he was expected to recover.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, he was reported to be in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.</p>

<p>Miss Asia was also recovered and returned to Gaga unharmed. No arrests have been made in this heinous crime.</p>
<p>Gaga has offered a $500,000 reward for the safe return of Gustav and Koji, promising no questions asked.</p>
<p>This entire traumatic ordeal is the stuff of nightmares, and we will keep all of those involved in our thoughts.</p>

<p>In news confirrmed by multiple reliable outlets &#8212; such as TMZ and People Magazine, among others &#8212; the singer&#8217;s dog walker was shot on Wenesday night and hospitalized.</p>
<p>Two of Lady Gaga&#8217;s bulldogs were subsequently stolen in the attack.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to the official police report, the unnamed walker was out with <em>three</em> of the artist&#8217;s canines.</p>
<p>One scurried away in the middle of the chaos and has since been recoved, as a photo snapped by a member of the paparazzi features an officer carrying a dog in a lip-print harness.</p>
<p>This one appears to be Gaga&#8217;s beloved pet, Asia.</p>
<p>The robbery occurred at 9:40 Wednesday night on Sierra Bonita Avenue in Hollywood.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Lady Gaga has not commented publicly on what transpired.</p>
<p>However, as you might expect, the performer is said to be &quot;extremely upset,&quot; per a TMZ reported, citing insiders close to the superstar.</p>
<p>To whomever has the two dogs, Gaga is offering a $500,000 reward, claiming she will ask no questions and adding that anyone with information can reach out to KojiandGustav@gmail.com.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve since learned that the identities of the pets taken are the celebrity&#8217;s French Bulldogs, Koji and Gustav.</p>

<p>The male victim, meanwhile, was transported to the hospital in unknown condition.</p>
<p>As for the shooter, he/she is described as a male who used a semi-automatic handgun and was spotted leaving in a vehicle going northbound toward Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga is currently in Italy.</p>

<p>The artist has over 46 million Instagram followers, all of whom are well acquainted with her quartet of dogs.</p>
<p>These four-legged friends have often been photographed on Gaga&#8217;s social media page, where she&#8217;s shared an endless array snapshots of the dogs over the years.</p>
<p>&quot;People enjoy your warm homes, families and pets today,&quot; she captioned a picture of her and Asia from around the holidays in December 2015, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Feel grateful for all you have, and not what you do not.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Sources now say that the dog walker is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
<p>We very much hope the same can soon be said of the dogs this person was walking.</p>
<p>The person who took them best not harm a piece of fur on their bodies&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; and better eventually be caught and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Donald Trump is not very popular in the world of pop music right now.</p>
<p>First, <a href="/2020/05/taylor-swift-to-donald-trump-america-will-vote-you-out-racist-mf/">Taylor Swift trashed the President as a hypocritical A-Hole</a> who America will vote out of office in November.</p>
<p>Now, Lady Gaga has basically gone ahead and said the same thing.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In the wake of a Minnesota resident named <a href="/2020/05/beyonce-posts-powerful-message-in-response-george-floyd-killing/">George Floyd being killed</a> by a local police officer, along with the very public demonstrations that have broken out across the country in response to this racial injustice, Gaga has issued a lengthy statement on Instagram.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well worth your time to read.</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing I want to say is I&#8217;m afraid to say anything that will incite further anger, although that is precisely the emotion that is justified,&quot; the artist said on Saturday night.</p>
<p>She wrote this message while peaceful protest in nearly every major city turned violent.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I do not wish to contribute to more violence, I wish to contribute to a solution,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>The superstar went on to emphasize her own &quot;outrage&quot; at Floyd&#8217;s death, along with the &quot;deaths of exponentially too many black lives over hundreds of years that have been taken from us in this country as a result of systemic racism and the corrupt systems that support it.&quot;</p>
<p>A video of Floyd&#8217;s final moments went viral the day after Floyd was killed.</p>
<p>The cop who knelt on his neck for close to nine minutes has since been arrested on third-degree murder charges.</p>
<p>None of the other three officers in the vicinity, however, all of whom witnessed the incident and did nothing about it, have been arrested.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Protests and riots have continued daily and nightly across the country, with more than 20 cities imposing strict curfews as violence erupted in multiple locations.</p>
<p>&quot;The voices of the black community have been silenced for too long and that silence has proven deadly time and time again,&quot; wrote Gaga.</p>
<p>&quot;And no matter what they do to protest, they are still met with no compassion by the leaders that are meant to protect them.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyday people in America are racist, that&#8217;s a fact.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As for Trump?</p>
<p>Lady Gaga offered a scathing rebuke of the president, who she described as &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;a fool.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying that he&#8217;s failed, Gaga added that he &quot;offers nothing but ignorance and prejudice while black lives continue to be taken&quot; and she then added how it&#8217;s time for &quot;a change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We MUST show our love for the black community,&quot; she wrote. &quot;As a white, privileged woman, I take an oath to stand by that.&quot;</p>

<p>Gaga and Swift are just major names to have spoken out against racial injustice in light of Floyd&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>In her own video on Saturday, Beyonc&eacute; stated that &quot;we need justice for George Floyd,&quot; and linked to several petitions in her bio.</p>
<p>&quot;We all witnessed his murder in broad daylight,&quot; she said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re broken, and we&#8217;re disgusted. We cannot normalize this pain. I&#8217;m not only speaking to people of color.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#8217;re white, black, brown, or anything in between, I&#8217;m sure you feel hopeless by the racism going on in America right now. No more senseless killings of human beings.&quot;</p>
