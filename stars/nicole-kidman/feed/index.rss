<p>Is Nicole Kidman pregnant again? Will she have a 5th child?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the question asked time and time again of the Oscar winner. With two children with her husband, Keith Urban, and two grown kids with her ex, Tom Cruise, four kiddos might be the end of the road for her. She is, after all, 57.</p>



<p>Then again, nothing is impossible in Hollywood &#8212; and Nicole has gushed so heartily about being a mother that the time just might be right for the beloved star to think about expanding her family.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s let Nicole speak for herself, shall we?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-kidman-pregnant-a-look-back-at-early-motherhood-days">Nicole Kidman Pregnant: A Look Back At Early Motherhood Days</h2>



<p>&#8220;I love, love children. I love raising children,&#8221; Nicole shared with the <em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38560832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a></em> in 2017.</p>



<p>At the time, she was promoting her movie, <em>Lion</em>, a film that beautifully depicted the power of an adoptive mother&#8217;s&nbsp;love.</p>



<p>Nicole knows a little something about that first hand. </p>

<p>While she and then husband Tom Cruise tried to get pregnant with a child, during the marriage, the pair ended up adopting two children.</p>



<p>Daughter Isabella was adopted in 1992, followed by Connor&nbsp;in 1995.</p>



<p>After the couple split, Nicole remarried and started a family with Keith Urban. </p>



<p>These days, she does not have much contact with her adult children; to put it lightly, the relationships are strained. </p>



<p>In 2007, the age of 40, Nicole gave birth to their first biological daughter, Sunday. Her little sister, Faith Margaret was born via surrogate two years later.</p>

<p>Of being a mom, Nicole admitted she finds the most joy in watching her kids &#8220;grow&#8221; and relishes in the wonderful things they &#8220;say and teach.&#8221; But in that BBC interview, she admitted that she really wanted more children with Keith. </p>



<p>&#8220;I would have liked probably two or three more children,&#8221; Nicole said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-kid-for-nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban">Another Kid For Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban</h2>



<p>So again we ask, is Nicole Kidman pregnant with her fifth child? No, that ship may have sailed. However, there has been talk of the power couple adopting more kids to add to their family. </p>



<p>According to those closest to her, Nicole still feels &#8220;young enough and has the energy for <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-adopting-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another baby</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nicole has had pregnancy and fertility problems in the past that kept her family smaller than she had hoped for,&#8221; a friend of the star told RadarOnline.com</p>



<p>&#8220;Nicole found she and Keith got so wrapped up in<a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nicole-kidman-excited-new-baby-mama-55-report-1711357#:~:text=%22Nicole%20has%20had%20pregnancy%20and,the%20couple%20told%20the%20newspaper." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> raising the kids</a>, she put the idea of adopting out of her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;But now that the girls are becoming more independent, she sees it&#8217;s time they really work on bringing another child into their home &#8211; and all the happiness that would bring to the family!&#8221;</p>



<p>While Nicole has not expressly said she and Keith are having another child, clearly being a mother is something she loves.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t count her out just yet! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-playing-a-mother-on-screen">Nicole Playing A Mother On-Screen</h2>



<p>From the <em>Goldfinch</em>, to <em>Lion</em>, to <em>Boy Erased,</em> Nicole has played some exceptionally wonderful mother roles in her films.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the acclaimed film <em>Babygirl</em>, one of her most recent projects is a dramatic miniseries called <em>Expats</em> for Amazon. In the series, produced by Nicole and her company Blossom Films, she&#8217;ll play a mother named Margaret in terrible distress. </p>



<p>Margaret rides an emotional roller coaster after her son goes missing in a Hong Kong night market. </p>



<p>Understanding the ferocity of love as a mother herself, Nicole revealed she could relate, even if it was a difficult role.  </p>



<p>“She will not give up hope, which was probably the thing I related to—that desire to go, ‘No, I know deep down, my child is out there and I’ll find my child,’” Kidman said of her&nbsp;<em>Expats</em>&nbsp;character in an <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a60134221/nicole-kidman-interview-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with <em>Elle</em></a>.</p>



<p> “She’s got this dogged refusal to accept anyone that tells her differently. She just won’t stop. And that’s what I think I empathized with.”</p>

<p>Nicole Kidman and Salma Hayek seemed to have an awkward encounter during <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/victoria-beckham-crutches-paris-fashion-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris Fashion Week</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-kidman-salma-hayek-feud-what-s-happening-here">Nicole Kidman-Salma Hayek Feud: What&#8217;s Happening Here?</h2>



<p>The footage shows Nicole and Salma engaged in what initially appears to be a friendly chat on the red carpet.</p>



<p>But the conversation takes a turn when a photographer asks for “one more” photo. </p>



<p>In video obtained by<em> <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/13/celebrity-news/nicole-kidman-seemingly-pushes-salma-hayek-away-during-tense-moment-at-balenciaga-fashion-show/?utm_campaign=pagesixdaily&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20241014&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=P6%20-%20Page%20Six%20Daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>,</em> Salma places her hand on Nicole in order to nudge her in the direction of the camera.</p>

<p>According to <em>Page Six,</em> Kidman then &#8220;grabbed Hayek’s hand and pushed it away.&#8221;</p>



<p>In truth, she gently removed Salma&#8217;s hand from her shoulder. But yes, the gesture did create the impression that she wasn&#8217;t happy with being nudged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-awkward-interaction">An Awkward Interaction</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear what sort of words were exchanged in that exact moment, but after Nicole walked away, Salma remarked, “Yes, please. Advice.”</p>



<p>“You don’t need it,” Nicole responded, prompting Salma to reply, “I do.”</p>

<p>Whatever happened, it seems that everyone involved got over it quickly. Nicole continued her progress down the carpet, and Salma posed for some pics with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/katy-perry/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Perry</a>.</p>



<p>And if there was beef at any point, it was quickly squashed. On October 1, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAlznzCIJ7R/?hl=en&amp;img_index=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salma posted a photo</a> of herself and Nicole at the event.</p>



<p>“Finally last night the grand finale of my Paris Fashion Week 2025. Balenciaga and Demna for a terrific show,” she captioned the post.</p>



<p>She also tagged Nicole, Katy, and Lindsay Lohan in the caption.</p>

<p>Nicole went on to win best actress at the Venice for her role in <em>Babygirl</em>. She was, of course, not on hand to receive the award. </p>



<p>Obviously, the death of a parent is not something that anyone recovers from easily.</p>



<p>But sources close to Nicole say that she&#8217;s holding up well and focusing on her family and her work.</p>



<p>And with a slew of upcoming projects, including the highly anticipated Prime Video series <em><a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/nicole-kidman-as-patricia-cornwells-kay-scarpetta-is-not-at-all-what-i-envisioned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarpetta</a></em> slated for the months to come, the beloved star has never been busier.</p>

<p>A professional milestone&#8230; and a personal tragedy.</p>



<p>Nicole Kidman announced the death of her mother Janelle on September 6, the same date on which she won Best Actress for her role in <em>Babygirl</em> at the Venice Film Festival.</p>



<p>Kidman&#8217;s mom was 84 years old.</p>

<p>The sad news was confirmed via a statement read on stage by Halina Rejn, who directed Kidman in the aforementioned film.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, I arrived in Venice to find out shortly after, that my beautiful, brave mother Janelle Ann Kidman has just passed,&#8221; Kidman&#8217;s message said. &#8220;I am in shock and I have to go to my family.&#8221;</p>



<p>The statement continued, </p>



<p>&#8220;But this award is for her. She shaped me, she guided me and she made me. I&#8217;m beyond grateful that I that I get to say her name to all of you through Halina. The collision of life and art is heartbreaking, and my heart is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cause of Janelle&#8217;s death is not known at this time.</p>



<p>Kidman&#8217;s mother, who worked as a nursing instructor, had suffered health issues in recent years. </p>



<p>In 2022, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Academy Award winner said that she returned to her family&#8217;s native Australia to be with her sick parent.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re down here primarily to take care of my mother,&#8221; the now-57-year-old said in an NPR interview in January of that year. &#8220;And to have her surrounded by her grandchildren.&#8221;</p>



<p>Added Kidman back then:</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at the place where I&#8217;m being given the chance to view the world—because of how close we are, my mom is giving me the chance to view the world through an 81-year-old woman&#8217;s eyes. That is so beneficial right now because she&#8217;s so cognizant.</p>



<p>&#8220;She has every faculty, brain faculty, available. She hasn&#8217;t lost anything. She hasn&#8217;t lost any memory, which is fascinating.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2020, Kidman spoke with the Sydney Morning Herald about the influence her mom had on her life and her amazing career.</p>



<p>“She’s given me the fire to pursue the career I have because I’ve always wanted to please her,” Kidman told the outlet, according to the Hollywood Reporter. </p>



<p>“But she also carved her own path and wanted her daughters to have the same opportunity to carve their own paths&#8230;</p>



<p>“Mum didn’t necessarily get the career that she wanted, but she was determined that her daughters would have opportunities that were equal. That’s given me my life. And she gave me my life, she and my dad.”</p>



<p><strong>We send our condolences to Nicole Kidman, her friends, family members and all who knew Janelle.</strong></p>

<p>Tom Cruise and his kids appear together in a rare photo that fans are eating up.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/suri-cruise-prepares-to-turn-18-remains-very-estranged-from-famous-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suri Cruise remains thoroughly estranged from her father</a>, her polarizing dad has <em>other </em>children.</p>



<p>Decades ago, he and ex-wife Nicole Kidman welcomed their two, treasured children.</p>



<p>And while they <em>largely </em>stay out of the limelight, they appeared together in a still recent public pic with Tom Cruise &#8211; days after refusing to do the same with Nicole Kidman. </p>

<p>Sometimes, celebrity photos surface on other accounts and do not immediately gain traction. That is the case with a December 2023 photo that former NFL player Derrick Brooks shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1YQuATMQHV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. </p>



<p>In the now resurfaced pic, Brooks explained that Cruise had stopped by ahead of a hockey game.</p>



<p>“Good Evening, Wow, look who stopped by my office before our [Tampa Bay Lightning] game tonight! @tomcruise,” Brooks wrote in the caption. “I was a little star struck but played it cool and He said he was too!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Instagram photo, Tom Cruise appears in a fairly prominent position beside Brooks himself.</p>



<p>Cruise&#8217;s 29-year-old son, Connor, stands to Brooks&#8217; other side. In the photo, he flashes a thumbs up.</p>



<p>Tom&#8217;s daughter, Bella, also appears in the group pic, albeit less prominently. She stands behind the men, flashing a smile.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-kidman-and-tom-cruise-share-two-children-bella-and-connor">Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise share two children: Bella and Connor</h2>



<p>Tom Cruise was married to sensational actress and beloved AMC meme queen Nicole Kidman from 1990 until 2001.</p>



<p>In 1992, they adopted Isabella (Bella). Three years later, in 1995, the then-couple adopted Connor.</p>



<p>Despite Cruise and Kidman&#8217;s divorce, they both maintain relationships with their children. Part of the &#8220;secret&#8221; to this, many believe, is Kidman&#8217;s reluctance to speak out against their father or of the Church of Scientology in public.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-1024x682.jpg" alt="Tom Cruise in July of 2023." class="wp-image-499428" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0507_tomcruise_02-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise make a surprise theatre appearance to celebrate &#8220;Mission: Impossible â Dead Reckoning Part One&#8221; presented by Paramount Pictures and Skydance at Regal Atlantic Station on July 11, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Derek White/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tom Cruise and Katy Holmes were married from 2006 until 2012. Before their divorce, the two welcomed Suri Cruise, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/tom-cruise-child-support-for-suri-katie-holmes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned 18 on April 18, 2024</a>.</p>



<p>As far as the public knows, father and daughter have not seen each other in over a decade. The public is divided over whether this estrangement will be permanent and over whether it is ultimately for the best.</p>



<p>Unlike Suri, however, Bella and Conner retain a relationship with both parents.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-kidman-has-used-tact-and-diplomacy-but-it-hasn-t-always-paid-off">Nicole Kidman has used tact and diplomacy, but it hasn&#8217;t always paid off</h2>



<p>Since marrying Keith Urban, Nicole Kidman has welcomed daughters Sunday and Faith, who are both now teenagers.</p>



<p>Most of the world assumes that Kidman has no end of things to say about Tom Cruise, their marriage, and her experiences with the Church of Scientology &#8212; a controversial organization that has made Cruise something of a poster-boy. She has deftly avoided these topics, however.</p>



<p>Kidman&#8217;s caution has mostly paid off, though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/nicole-kidman-adopted-kids-tom-cruise-afi-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her eldest children did snub her</a> on a big night recently. Family can be very complex. A family photo like Tom Cruise&#8217;s is even more rare for Kidman.</p>

While that in itself isn&#8217;t shocking, because she already had two children prior to the third, the interesting part is that she had made a divorce announcement just months before falling pregnant with husband Brian Austin Green&#8217;s child, Journey River Green. She even kept the child&#8217;s last name the same as daddy&#8217;s. Ultimately, the pair stayed together for awhile, but divorced soon after. Now she&#8217;s with MGK &#8211; or is she?

<p>When Nicole Kidman channels Britney Spears, you know that something wonderful is happening.</p>



<p>Kidman is so much more than an AMC commercial meme. She is an international treasure.</p>



<p>Gracing a magazine cover is as natural for her as breathing.</p>



<p>Speaking of the natural world, her latest scene partner was a snake &#8230; and it&#8217;s giving fans flashbacks to one of Britney Spears&#8217; most iconic VMAs performances.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-kidman-is-cover-material">Nicole Kidman is cover material</h2>



<p>The beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman is gracing the cover of <em>Vogue Australia</em>.</p>



<p>Her &#8220;Nicole Kidman doesn&#8217;t follow the rules&#8221; piece is evident from the cover, where she makes a wild and fun expression.</p>



<p>Also, she&#8217;s not on the cover alone. Atop her alluring black lace, she&#8217;s also wearing a real, live snake.</p>

<p>Some social media commenters have already been claiming that they don&#8217;t recognize Kidman in some of the photos.</p>



<p>Truth be told? Some of that could be ageism, but it probably has more to do with her hairstyle and glasses than anything else.</p>



<p>The snake is absolutely getting people&#8217;s attention. Which is <em>part </em>of the reason for which the beloved actress has this reptilian scene partner.</p>

<p><em>Vogue Australia</em> also shared a behind-the-scenes look at Nicole Kidman&#8217;s photoshoot.</p>



<p>In the Instagram video, which you can watch below, we see Kidman and her slithering fellow model arranging themselves for the camera.</p>



<p>For multiple poses, Kidman has the snake wrapped around her waist. Of course, it seems like Kidman takes direction a little more than this charming reptile.</p>

<p>In the caption of the Instagram post, Vogue Australia wrote about the photoshoot behind the February cover.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-12">&#8220;Nicole Kidman is very careful about who she chooses to go on adventures with,&#8221; the caption noted.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-12">&#8220;But,&#8221; the caption continued, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t mean she doesn&#8217;t go on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She added that she finds the way that &#8220;they slither and move&#8221; to be very fascinating. Relatable!</p>



<p>Kidman went on to express that &#8220;they&#8217;re very beautiful.&#8221; We&#8217;d go so far as to say <em>magazine-worthy</em>!</p>

<p>Kidman also highlighted the less than literal meaning of the way that snakes shed their skins.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can become and try different things, all the time,&#8221; she noted, &#8220;which is what excites me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kidman explained that she applies that mindset to her career, in which she has played a variety of different roles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even see it as reinvention,&#8221; Kidman explained when reflecting upon the shifts in her career. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s more like different facets that you discover that are in existence,&#8221; she mused.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Kidman continued, &#8220;you are attuned to the discovery of them.&#8221; That is an esoteric, but interesting, way of viewing her life!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remain very open and still very passionate about what I do,&#8221; Kidman affirmed, &#8220;and curious.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then asserted: &#8220;And those elements haven&#8217;t been dampened.&#8221;</p>



<p>We love that Kidman retains such enthusiasm for her craft. She is a monumentally talented actress and we&#8217;re always happy to see her on screen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-giving-classic-britney-spears-vibes">It&#8217;s giving classic Britney Spears vibes</h2>



<p>Social media commenters have pointed out that this is a photoshoot where Nicole Kidman channels Britney Spears &#8230; albeit, 2001 Britney at the VMAs, not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/britney-spears-banned-four-seasons-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current Britney Spears</a>. And only because she is wielding a snake.</p>



<p>Some of Reddit&#8217;s serpentine <em>size queens </em>have scoffed at Kidman&#8217;s snake, suggesting that Britney&#8217;s much larger reptile set the standard. In other words, that Kidman&#8217;s is just too small.</p>



<p>But we think that this world is big enough for big snakes, small snakes, and even the occasional photo of a celebrity who is not wearing a snake at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Hollywood marriages aren&#8217;t always built to last.</p>



<p>For a whole host of reasons, from busy schedules to way too many resources to certain temperaments to looks and wealth and rumors &#8230; celebrity relationships tend to crumble before our eyes.</p>



<p>So it makes sense that when you last a long time, you want to show it off. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are doing just that with a series of adorable&nbsp;selfies &#8212; because they&#8217;re celebrating their 11th&nbsp;anniversary.</p>



<p>To be clear, 11 years is a long time to stay together for a regular, run-of-the-mill, non-celebrity married couple.</p>



<p>In Hollywood years, it&#8217;s like these two have been married for the better part of a century.</p>



<p>But somehow Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban (the one who isn&#8217;t Nicole Kidman) have managed it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="680" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-680x1024.jpg" alt="Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the CMTs" class="wp-image-267461" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-1360x2048.jpg 1360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-735x1107.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-222x335.jpg 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-230x347.jpg 230w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-345x520.jpg 345w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-425x640.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-510x768.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-637x960.jpg 637w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-717x1080.jpg 717w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-scaled.jpg 1700w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban pose for photographers here at the 2017 CMTs Awards in Nashville.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And they&#8217;ve done so despite <a href="/2017/05/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-what-prompted-their-biggest-fight/">major disagreements about where to live</a>. That takes work.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the baggage that they have.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t just mean regular relationship baggage or fame baggage.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t even mean the fact that the Oscar-winning actress and the Crunchy &#8230; sorry, <em>Country </em>music singer come from different worlds.</p>



<p>(Like, <a href="/2017/06/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-still-together-closer-than-ever/">Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are closer than ever</a> and they also come from different worlds)</p>



<p>Nicole Kidman also had a famous relationship with Tom Cruise.</p>



<p>The rest of her life is haunted by the specter of Scientology.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t speak about the Church, but we all know how this works.</p>



<p>The kids that she and Tom adopted together are still Scientologists.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re adults, but were Nicole to ever speak ill of the Church or very likely of Tom, she&#8217;d be declared a Suppressive Person, and she&#8217;d never get to see them.</p>



<p>It can be a strain to be interviewed constantly and have to give a tight-lipped smile when people ask about a subject that makes you want to scream.</p>

Moreover, Kidman was once married to Cruise, so these same critics think she&#8217;s open to arrange marriages.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty Images for CMT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And that tension from walking a verbal tightrope can impact both members of a couple.</p>



<p>But it looks like they&#8217;re not letting it touch them.</p>



<p>Also, though they&#8217;re both celebrities, there&#8217;s something of a fame disparity between the two.</p>



<p>Because Nicole Kidman isn&#8217;t a niche celebrity. She&#8217;s, you know, world-famous as an actress.</p>



<p>Toby Keith sometimes gets confused with another Country singer by people who aren&#8217;t in that particular music fandom.</p>



<p>Remember, Keith Urban is the one married to Nicole Kidman.</p>



<p><em>Toby Keith</em>&nbsp;is the one who played for an all-male audience in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>(Toby Keith Urban is their fused state, and can fly, but they only combine in real emergencies)</p>



<p>But Keith and Nicole look happy and also way younger than they actually are.</p>



<p>Because Nicole is 50 and Keith is 49.</p>



<p>Does time mean nothing to these two?</p>



<p>Yeah, these two are really adorable.</p>



<p>Some other couples have lasted for a really long time, but in a world where <a href="/2016/09/angelina-jolie-files-for-divorce-from-brad-pitt/">Brangelina&nbsp;is divorcing</a>, staying married means really beating the odds.</p>



<p>(Though rumor has it that <a href="/2017/06/brad-pitt-using-custody-talks-to-win-back-angelina-jolie/">Brad Pitt is hoping to win back Angelina Jolie</a>, so &#8230; we&#8217;ll see how that goes)</p>



<p>Yeah, these are really adorable.</p>



<p>Also, who says that old people can&#8217;t be cute, you know?</p>



<p>And, not for nothing, but this is such a level-headed, grounded way of celebrating an anniversary.</p>



<p>As far as we know, they didn&#8217;t swim around in a champagne pool or do any other ridiculous rich people stuff.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re together for over a decade, sometimes happiness with your partnership is just <em>enough</em>, you know?</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need all of the rest.</p>
