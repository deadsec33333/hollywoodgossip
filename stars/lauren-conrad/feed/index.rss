<p>His castmates know it &#8212; including former castmate Lauren Conrad.</p>
<p>Heidi Montag says that Lauren once threatened to have her booted from the series if she didn&#8217;t dump Spencer.</p>
<p>She also says that Lauren treated her like a &quot;dog&quot; &#8230; and could have been a makeup mogul like Kylie Jenner.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>This week, Heidi Montag was a guest on Alexandra Cooper&#8217;s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/42ZrP6vWE19UtRD6OcWhNT"><em>Call Her Daddy</em></a> podcast.</p>
<p>Alexandra had praised Lauren for opting out of the ongoing &quot;scramble&quot; for fame.</p>
<p>Heidi shared that she has a slightly different take on her former castmate.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I feel like Kristin, let&#8217;s be honest, is the most successful,&quot; Heidi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like Lauren didn&#8217;t make it like she should have,&quot; she opined.</p>
<p>Heidi added: &quot;She should be Kylie [Jenner].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was so good at makeup,&quot; Heidi explained, seemingly praising her friend.</p>
<p>Still speaking of Lauren, she added that &quot;she should have done the tutorials.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she had a good team, she&#8217;d be a billionaire,&quot; Heidi estimated before revising: &quot;She&#8217;d be a hundred-millionaire.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="280" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/06/you-know-what-you-did.gif" alt="You Know What You Did" class="wp-image-14488"><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;She is not where she should have been at all,&quot; Heidi opined.</p>
<p>&quot;She has a Kohl&#8217;s line,&quot; she acknowledged dismissively. &quot;Great, whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But she should be a hundred-millionaire,&quot; Heidi insisted, &quot;are you kidding me?&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="527" height="337" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-on-the-hills.jpg" alt="Lauren Conrad on The Hills" class="wp-image-235414" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-on-the-hills.jpg 527w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-on-the-hills-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-on-the-hills-335x214.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-on-the-hills-347x222.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-on-the-hills-520x333.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Who gets that big promotion, that big fame,&quot; Heidi began.</p>
<p>&quot;That big engine behind her, the loved one, the this-and-that,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;The narrator,&quot; Heidi continued. &quot;No one even gets the narrator show.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kylie didn&#8217;t get a narrator show,&quot; Heidi pointed out.</p>
<p>Describing Lauren, Heidi added: &quot;She should be so rich.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of a backhanded compliment to say that someone could be mega-wealthy but totally threw away their chance at it.</p>

<p>Still, Heidi insisted that she will &quot;always love&quot; Lauren.</p>
<p>She still credits her for giving her a start in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>But Heidi recalls how her husband, Spencer Pratt, was viewed and treated by Lauren early in their relationship.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="400" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/spencer-pratt-shrugs-while-heidi-montag-beams.gif" alt="Spencer Pratt Shrugs While Heidi Montag Beams" class="wp-image-18982"><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;When that whole Spencer thing happened,&quot; Heidi recalled.</p>
<p>She accused Lauren of demanding that she drop her now-husband.</p>
<p>According to Heidi: &quot;she&#8217;s like, &#8216;If you date Spencer, you&#8217;re off the show.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you,&quot; Heidi responded, her indignation just as palpable all of these years later.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she continued, &quot;I&#8217;m not your dog.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, her gratitude for what Lauren did for her only went so far.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="265" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-sucky-person-gif.gif" alt="Lauren Conrad: Sucky Person GIF" class="wp-image-235468"><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I appreciate you getting me on this show,&quot; Heidi characterized her reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;But that doesn&#8217;t mean you own me,&quot; she noted, &quot;and you can tell me what to do in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Heidi expressed: &quot;I just don&#8217;t appreciate that.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I do have such a love for Lauren,&quot; Heidi then claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she added, &quot;it didn&#8217;t have to go that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She chose and wanted it to go that way,&quot; Heidi accused.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;And then kept following up with that,&quot; Heidi said.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she went on, &quot;then kept blaming things on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Heidi added that Lauren was resentful of her &quot;and blaming her sex tape on me.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The Hills are alive with the sounds of&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; crying.</p>
<p>Both of the happy and frustrated variety, we should specify, because&nbsp;Lauren Conrad just welcomed a brand new baby into the world!</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The former MTV personality confirmed this blessed piece of news herself on Wednesday evening being an adorable drawing of what we presume to be herself, her husband William Tell and their two kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our sweet baby boy, Charlie Wolf Tell, has arrived!&rdquo; Conrad wrote on Instagram as a caption to the cool image below.</p>
<p>The couple is already parents to son Liam James Tell, 2.</p>
<p>The Hills alumna initially <a href="/2019/04/lauren-conrad-pregnant-with-baby-number-2/">shared news of her second pregnancy</a> back in April, posting a sweet photo of her bump and writing along with it:</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been hard to keep this one to myself! Very excited to share that our family will be getting a little bigger this year.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Conrad, who has remained mostly out of the spotlight ever since the original The Hills went off the air (she plays no role in the much-maligned reboot) married Tell&nbsp;in a September 2014 sunset ceremony at a boutique winery.</p>
<p>She mostly makes a living these days in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>A decade before tying the knot and shifting her goals, however, an 18-year-old Conrad sky-rocketed to prominence after being cast on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County.</p>
<p>This reality show chronicled her and her friends&#8217; lives in their hometown of Laguna Beach, California.</p>
<p>This series was then spunoff to create The Hills two years later.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After it went off the air, though, Conrad really focused on her family life and the fashion world, never even responding to shade hurled her way by former rivals Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag.</p>
<p>She really does seem far over all that these days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, meanwhile, Lauren opened up about finding her footing when it comes to parenthood.</p>
<p>&quot;Feeling like your quote unquote old self, I think takes a really long time,&quot; she said in her Asking For a Friend podcast, adding at the time:</p>
<p>&quot;For me, I would argue it took me at least a year to start feeling like normal again.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re guessing millions and millions of women can relate to this quote and the sentiment behind it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Thankfully, the ex-reality star has learned to lean on her parents &#8212; and her husband&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of pressure to do it on your own and I felt that even with all the help I was like, &#8216;No, I need to do this all by myself,&#8217;&quot; Lauren said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t know when we decided that that was the way it was supposed to be or set that standard because it&#8217;s so impossible. When you&#8217;re not sleeping, that&#8217;s a form of torture!</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;ll literally lose your mind to the point where I was like, &lsquo;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m qualified to watch a baby right now. I don&#8217;t know if I should be left along with my child. I haven&#8217;t slept in three days. I&#8217;m so tired.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>We feel ya, LC.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re so very happy for you and William!</p>
<p>Congrats on the new addition!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>In case anyone needs a reminder, podcasts are totally public. If you&#8217;re a celebrity and you go on a podcast and make a total ass of yourself, people are going to find out.</p>
<p>If you come across as a bigot, even if you didn&#8217;t mean to, it is not going to stay a secret.</p>
<p>Spencer Pratt seems to have forgotten that, because &#8212; on top of bashing Lauren Conrad and then asking why she doesn&#8217;t want to work with him &#8212; he said some truly unacceptable things about Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>You know, the recent Spencer Pratt has been relatively well-behaved.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get us wrong, he&#8217;s still the guy who blew through millions of dollars in a frighteningly short amount of time.</p>
<p>(That was a collaborative effort between him and Heidi)</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s been doing so well. <a href="/2017/04/heidi-montag-pregnant-with-first-child/">He and Heidi Montag are expecting their first child</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge milestone for the legendary reality couple.</p>
<p>(At seven months, <a href="/2017/08/heidi-montag-my-baby-bump-is-ginormous/">Heidi Montag&#8217;s baby bump was ginormous!</a>&nbsp;And Heidi is coming up on eight months, now)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s seemed like they&#8217;ve settled into being people who set realistic goals, instead of people who respond to dwindling finances by spending <em>six figures</em> on crystals because they hope that the energies or vibrations or whatever will restore their bank accounts.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>He still likes them. But hey, who doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Spencer recently sat down for an interview for the podcast, <em>Allegedly With Theo Von &amp; Matthew Cole Weiss</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/allegedly-theo-von-matt-cole/id1020877360?mt=2at=10l6a2">Spencer Pratt bashes Lauren Conrad, talks about Scientology and Ryan Gosling</a>, discusses his unborn child&#8217;s potential dating life &#8230; and says some almost <em>unrepeatable </em>things about Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
<p>First, you know how some celebrities accept some nice financial incentives to let a magazine do some exclusive photos &#8212; of a wedding or, say, of their new baby?</p>
<p>Spencer and Heidi haven&#8217;t gotten any kind of lucrative photo deal, and Spencer blames Lauren Conrad.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Lauren Conrad just blew it for us, having the worst selling magazine cover in the history of the publication. She killed our numbers. She&#8217;s supposed to be the queen of <em>The Hills</em>, so all our money just went way down because of her.&quot;</p>
<p>Lauren Conrad&#8217;s <em>People </em>cover sold very poorly, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather taken no money to have that happen to her so it&#8217;s a win regardless.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Wow </em>that is spiteful.</p>
<p>You may remember that the conflict between Lauren Conrad and her former friends became a central storyline on <em>The Hills</em> for years until Lauren left.</p>
<p>Apparently Spencer is still feeling that resentment, after all of these years.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="469" height="594" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/spencer-pratt-in-la.jpg" alt="Spencer Pratt In L.A" class="wp-image-235571" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/spencer-pratt-in-la.jpg 469w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/spencer-pratt-in-la-237x300.jpg 237w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/spencer-pratt-in-la-265x335.jpg 265w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/spencer-pratt-in-la-274x347.jpg 274w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/spencer-pratt-in-la-411x520.jpg 411w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Spencer&#8217;s explanation for why Lauren Conrad won&#8217;t do a reunion with them is, in light of his bitterness, pretty interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people don&#8217;t want to share any shine, they&#8217;d rather sit on their Instagram account.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe Lauren Conrad doesn&#8217;t want to interact with someone who can&#8217;t stand her.</p>
<p>Also, maybe Lauren Conrad didn&#8217;t hemorrhage money left and right and is estimated to be worth something like $25 million today.</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t need to do a reunion special if she doesn&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Spencer says that he&#8217;d be okay if his unborn child grows up and wants to date Lauren&#8217;s son, Liam.</p>
<p>&quot;If he wants to date Liam, that&#8217;s up to him. I personally will be targeting Kristin Cavallari&#8217;s $100 million + daughter for my son. Kristin, I&#8217;ll be such a good in-law!&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, that&#8217;s funny. And a nice blow to heteronormativity. A lot of parents just assume that their kid will be straight by default, and they set themselves up for a surprise.</p>
<p>(To be clear, we don&#8217;t think that Spencer and Heidi are actually planning to raise their kid to be a gold-digger)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Spencer Pratt says that he and Ryan Gosling used to be neighbors who hung out, and that Ryan Gosling told him some chilling tales about Scientology.</p>
<p>&quot;He told me a story about Scientology that has stuck with me for years. Let&#8217;s just say it involved people not surviving heavy shit and I was like, oh wow, this is not something to joke about.&quot;</p>
<p>To be clear, we don&#8217;t know where Ryan Gosling would have heard these stories, except perhaps from ex-Scientologists. But we&#8217;ve read enough horrific accounts about that organization to never be surprised at what we hear.</p>
<p>Spencer gets really awful now, so &#8230; brace yourselves.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>He not only deadnames Caitlyn Jenner, but also misgenders her &#8212; as if he&#8217;d just awoken from a two-year coma.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m Team Kris Jenner. I was Team Brody. Bruce is like the worst person ever. He wouldn&#8217;t even call Brody on his birthday and he was in the valley. It&#8217;s not like he was in the Czech Republic. He was always bad as a human from what I saw as Brody&#8217;s best friend. I had heard he had gotten hormone injections and all that but to me I was like, whatever, maybe that&#8217;s Tuesday.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly rude to misgender someone or use their deadname, even if you&#8217;re talking about why they suck. And even if you&#8217;re talking about them before they transitioned or before they came out.</p>
<p>Caitlyn is a woman. You can say that she was a piss-poor parent without disrespecting her gender and that of every other trans woman on the planet.</p>
<p>Maybe worst of all is Spencer&#8217;s commentary about Caitlyn&#8217;s reasons for transitioning or &#8230; something.</p>
<p>&quot;It was so back in the day and I loved titties so much, I thought maybe he just wanted titties to rub on, like his own titties, I don&#8217;t know. He was a ghost.&quot;</p>
<p>In case it needs to be said, trans women who get top surgery don&#8217;t do so because, um, they love boobs so much that they want to touch them.</p>
<p>Part of it is about being able to dress and be perceived as they want to.</p>
<p>Many (though not all) trans woman also experience dysphoria, where their bodies feel wrong until they have top surgery and then things feel like they&#8217;ve settled into place, as they should be.</p>
<p>Spencer doesn&#8217;t mean anything cruel by this, we think.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s probably just still the same idiot we saw on <em>The Hills</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On a brighter note, Spencer and Heidi might be coming back to reality television.</p>
<p>&quot;My own show, the paperwork&#8217;s signed. We&#8217;ll see if it ever goes onto an actual &#8230; one thing I&#8217;ve learned about networks is they&#8217;ll pay you and maybe the show [will never happen]. I&#8217;ve now been paid for two shows, whole seasons, that never went.&quot;</p>
<p>Yep. That&#8217;s how scripts and projects end up in limbo or development hell.</p>
<p>A network might think that something&#8217;s good enough that they won&#8217;t let anyone else do it, but not necessarily good enough to actually develop.</p>
<p>Oh, and Spencer and Heidi don&#8217;t have a sex tape. He says that he&#8217;d be willing to do one now for $10 million.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll just &#8230; pass on that.</p>
