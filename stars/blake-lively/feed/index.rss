<p>Blake Lively is missing the <em>coveted </em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/harvey-weinstein-backs-justin-baldoni-in-blake-lively-legal-war-this-is-just-like-what-happened-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey Weinstein endorsement</a>. And the disgraced producer isn&#8217;t the only one siding against her.</p>



<p>A friend of Justin Baldoni&#8217;s is backing him in his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million legal war</a> against the actress.</p>



<p>Lively&#8217;s legal filings accuse Baldoni of hiring one of his buddies for an already uncomfortable scene in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-movie-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Ends With Us</a></em>.</p>



<p>That man objects to her characterization of the scene and of his own acting credentials. And he&#8217;s willing to go to bad for Baldoni.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adam-mondschein-disagrees-with-blake-lively-s-recollection-of-it-ends-with-us">Adam Mondschein disagrees with Blake Lively&#8217;s recollection of &#8216;It Ends With Us&#8217;</h2>



<p>Actor Adam Mondschein <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/08/celebrity-news/it-ends-with-us-actor-claims-blake-lively-twisted-facts-in-bombshell-lawsuit-against-justin-baldoni/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to</a> <em>Page Six </em>to disparage Blake Lively&#8217;s characterization of the screen time that the two shared in <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>“I’m not going to speculate as to Ms. Lively’s motivations for mentioning me in the complaint,&#8221; he began.</p>



<p>Mondschein continued: &#8220;Needless to say, my experience working with her is very different than the one she described in her lawsuit. Indeed, I was surprised to read her description of the scene.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 9, 2024." class="wp-image-523051" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Blake Lively poses for a photocall during the premiere of the movie &#8220;It ends with us&#8221; in Copenhagen on August 9, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: NILS MEILVANG/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In both her initial complaint and her amended complaint, Lively expressed feeling &#8220;disturbed&#8221; by a number of Baldoni&#8217;s actions, behaviors, and choices.</p>



<p>Among them, she noted, were &#8220;new scenes&#8221; for the film. One of which, she described as a &#8220;violative birthing scene for which he cast a friend as her OBGYN.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively wrote that Baldoni “introduced his ‘best friend’ to play the role of the OBGYN, when ordinarily, a small role of this nature would be filled by a local actor.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mondschein-says-that-he-felt-that-things-were-totally-above-board">Mondschein says that he felt that things were totally above board</h2>



<p>“Ms. Lively felt that the selection of Mr. Baldoni’s friend for this intimate role, in which the actor’s face and hands were in close proximity to her nearly nude genitalia for a birth scene, was invasive and humiliating,” her complaint emphasized.</p>



<p>Mondschein, however, insisted to <em>Page Six</em> that “her costume included a full hospital gown, black shorts, and torso-covering prosthetic to make her appear pregnant in addition to whatever personal garments she chose.”</p>



<p>He alleged that Lively “never complained or expressed discomfort at any point because nothing unusual or improper occurred. It was entirely professional.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="753" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1024x753.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-523052" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-300x221.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-768x565.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-2048x1507.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-960x706.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1080x795.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1200x883.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 02, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mondschein also clearly bristled at what he felt was the implication that he was not a qualified actor to portray the OBGYN.</p>



<p>“Ms. Lively’s insinuations regarding my qualifications are offensive, as my bonafides are easily searchable online,” he expressed.</p>



<p>Mondschein added: “Lastly, I was, in fact, a local hire (my wife and I are from New York and spend significant time there). As such, I, like any actor accepting that contract, was required to cover my own travel and living expenses in connection with the job.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-s-willing-to-testify-for-team-baldoni-in-2026">He&#8217;s willing to testify for Team Baldoni in 2026</h2>



<p>“If I’m called to testify in the case I will answer truthfully, and more freely, whatever is asked of me with all the legal protection that affords,” Mondschein vowed. </p>



<p>He added: “In particular, by noting that Ms. Lively was not ‘nearly nude’ in the scene we shot together.”</p>



<p>For the record, Lively&#8217;s rep described her as &#8220;nearly nude from below the chest,&#8221; highlighting that her legs were &#8220;spread wide in stirrups and only a small piece of fabric covering her genitalia.&#8221; She allegedly did not receive a closed set for the scene, which fits an alleged pattern in her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal complaint</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1024x669.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-523055" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-2048x1338.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-960x627.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1200x784.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>An inside source furnished further details, commenting: “Blake was extremely uncomfortable, and understandably so, when she learned the actor who was placing his face between her legs was the boss’s best friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>That insider continued: &#8220;But apparently Baldoni and company think it was perfectly fine to have his best friend play that role, out of all the actors that could have been chosen.”</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like Lively would have had an issue with Mondschein had he not had this association with Baldoni. Mondschein, however, seems to be taking this very personally.</p>

<p>Ryan Reynolds&#8217; history of marriage and divorce goes back further than people think.</p>



<p>For years, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/10/ryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-debut-hilariously-censored-baby-p/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively</a> have been one of the hottest celebrity couples on the planet.</p>



<p>But so many of Reynolds&#8217; fans aren&#8217;t fully aware of his immensely famous exes.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s been a piece of arm candy &#8212; and arguably a trophy husband &#8212; before. Including to another <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/deadpool-3-spoilers-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">member of the MCU</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ryan-reynolds-almost-married-alanis-morissette">Ryan Reynolds Almost Married Alanis Morissette</h2>



<p>In 2002, Ryan Reynolds &#8212; at the time a heartthrob in his mid-twenties &#8212; was dating Alanis Morissette. </p>



<p>She was one of the most famous singers of the past decade. And, at the time, Reynolds had appeared in various Canadian shows, with his biggest claims to fame being guest spots on <em>The Outer Limits</em> and <em>X-Files</em>.</p>



<p>In June of 2004, the couple announced their engagement. There would not, however, be any rain (or other weather) on their wedding day.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="782" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-1024x782.jpg" alt="Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette in 2003." class="wp-image-504345" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-1024x782.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-300x229.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-768x586.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-2048x1563.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-960x733.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-1080x824.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_alanis-1200x916.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette pose backstage at The 2003 MTV Movie Awards held at the Shrine Auditorium on May 31, 2003.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>About two and a half years later, in February of 2007, Morissette and Reynolds announced their breakup.</p>



<p>Through their representatives, they explained that ending the engagement had been a mutual decision. It was not a divorce, but we&#8217;re sure that the emotional toll was similar.</p>



<p>In fact, Alanis Morisette&#8217;s album, <em>Flavors of Entanglement</em>, emerged from her grief over the split. &#8220;Torch&#8221; is, specifically, about Ryan Reynolds.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ryan-reynolds-s-divorce-with-scarlett-johansson">Ryan Reynolds&#8217;s Divorce With Scarlett Johansson</h2>



<p>It was not long after the 2007 split that Ryan Reynolds found himself dating actress Scarlett Johansson. This was 2007, and she was already legitimately famous.</p>



<p>By May of 2008, the two announced their engagement. They married in a private ceremony in Canada on September 27 of that same year.</p>



<p>However, on December 14 of 2010, Ryan and Scarlett announced their separation. Just over a week later, Reynolds filed for divorce, with Johanssen filing simultaneously. The two finalized their divorce on July 1 of 2011.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ryan-reynolds-met-blake-lively-in-2010">Ryan Reynolds met Blake Lively in 2010</h2>



<p>In early 2010, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively met while filming <em>Green Lantern</em>. Ryan played the titular Lantern (Hal Jordan), while Lively played Carol Ferris.</p>



<p>Carol is Hal&#8217;s love interest &#8230; though, had the film been good enough to warrant sequels, viewers might have seen her become the antagonist, Star Sapphire. Alas, it was not to be. We didn&#8217;t even get a Sinestro movie.</p>



<p>However, that film did something else: it (ultimately) brought together one of the entertainment industry&#8217;s hottest, most iconic (and did we mention hottest) couples.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-both-reynolds-and-lively-were-in-other-relationships-at-first">Both Reynolds and Lively were in other relationships (at first)</h2>



<p>It is important to emphasize that, according to the couple, this was not a steamy movie set affair. In fact, Reynolds was still married to Johansson at the time. And Lively was still dating Penn Badgley, her <em>Gossip Girl</em> co-star.</p>



<p>Blake Lively and Penn Badgley split by October of that year. And, as we already mentioned, Reynolds and Johansson were done a couple of months later.</p>



<p>A year after <em>Green Lantern</em>, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively were on a double date with other people. It was awkward for their respective dates &#8230; because the sparks were flying between the two &#8220;buddies.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-lively-breaks-silence-on-divorce-rumors">Blake Lively Breaks Silence on Divorce Rumors </h2>



<p>In October of 2011, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively began dating. They married on September 9, 2012. Unfortunately, that wedding is infamous &#8212; because it took place at Boone Hall Plantation in South Carolina. </p>



<p>The two have since apologized for marrying on the site of human rights atrocities, and even renewed their vows. </p>



<p>(Everyone makes mistakes, we suppose, but these two <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/blake-lively-apology-kate-middleton-cancer-photoshop-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make an effort to be good</a>, which is more than we can say about a lot of people)</p>



<p>Now, Reynolds and Lively share four children, welcoming them in 2014, 2016, 2019, and their youngest in February 2023. They announced baby #4&#8217;s name at the premiere of <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ryan Reynolds in October of 2023." class="wp-image-504348" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0719_ryanreynolds_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Reynolds attends the 2023 Bring Change To Mind Gala at City Winery on October 09, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of which, while there is no definitive sign of a Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds divorce on the horizon, fans keep torturing them with rumors. You know, just for kicks. </p>



<p>“You and Ryan need to post more of each other, there were rumors going around that you two got divorced and I didn’t believe it because you two are literally the perfect couple,” a commenter wrote on a recent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9ulj2nJy2W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=da6505b0-f0d0-40aa-aa16-b36d144b57c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post from Lively dedicated to Reynolds and his new film.</p>



<p>Unwilling to let the moment lie, in a rare move, Blake actually responded back.  “Haha they wish.”</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/">Blake and Ryan are entangled in a legal dispute with Justin Baldoni</a>, who was Lively&#8217;s co-star and director on <em>It Ends With Us</em>. But the feud does not seem to have weakened the couple&#8217;s bond in any way. In fact, the opposite might be true.</p>



<p>Plenty of people have all but forgotten (or never knew in the first place) about this couple&#8217;s prior relationships. Looking at them, you&#8217;d think that they&#8217;d been together forever. And we&#8217;re sure they will be, going forward.</p>

<p>Justin Baldoni continues his legal war on Blake Lively.</p>



<p>His latest filing labels her husband, Ryan Reynolds, as her &#8220;co-conspirator.&#8221;</p>



<p>Baldoni has gone after Reynolds, essentially accusing him of being mean to him following Baldoni&#8217;s alleged misconduct towards Lively.</p>



<p>Now, he alleges that Reynolds standing by his wife amounts to a defamatory <em>conspiracy</em>, insisting that the lawsuit must go on.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-justin-baldoni-s-lawsuit-is-about-more-than-blake-lively">Justin Baldoni&#8217;s lawsuit is about more than Blake Lively</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-baldoni-calls-ryan-reynolds-blake-livelys-co-conspirator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> reports that in a Thursday, April 3 court filing, Justin Baldoni&#8217;s attorneys are lashing out at Ryan Reynolds&#8217; motion to dismiss.</p>



<p>Reynolds, Baldoni&#8217;s attorneys argue, &#8220;pretends that the Wayfarer Parties’ First Amended Complaint (the ‘FAC’) fails to set forth any basis for his liability and that he merely acted as a supportive spouse. Not so.”</p>



<p>Team Baldoni insists: “The FAC specifically alleges ample facts to support the Wayfarer Parties’ claims against him, based on both his direct actions and his liability as a co-conspirator.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1024x682.jpg" alt="Justin Baldoni on December 9, 2024." class="wp-image-522801" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actor/filmmaker and VOS Honoree, Justin Baldoni speaks onstage at the Vital Voices 12th Annual Voices of Solidarity Awards at IAC Building on December 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for  Vital Voices Global Partnership)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, attorneys for Baldoni say that if Reynolds receives his motion to dismiss, he should not be able to recover any attorneys&#8217; fees from their client.</p>



<p>Simply put, it appears that Reynolds&#8217; filing to dismiss the lawsuit against him is poking holes in the lawsuit itself while also noting that Reynolds is allowed to dislike someone (especially while supporting his wife).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Team Baldoni is portraying Reynolds as a &#8220;co-conspirator&#8221; in an alleged defamation conspiracy. The details on this seem pretty vague &#8212; but, perhaps, they will lay out a more comprehensive case in spring of 2026, in court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-team-ryan-reynolds-has-issued-a-response">Now, Team Ryan Reynolds has issued a response</h2>



<p>Speaking to <em>Us Weekly</em>, a spokesperson for Reynolds is not mincing words.</p>



<p>“The main takeaway from the Wayfarer Parties’ opposition to Ryan’s motion to dismiss their case is that they finally realize the plain defects in their complaint,” the statement read. </p>



<p>Team Reynolds continued: “They once again claim defamation without alleging who was defamed, what specifically was said, or how anyone suffered actual harm.”</p>

<p>“Unlike Mr. Baldoni, who built his brand pretending to be a man who is ‘confident enough to listen’ to the women in his life,&#8221; the scathing statement set up.</p>



<p>The statement continued: &#8220;Ryan Reynolds actually is that man and he will continue to support his wife as she stands up to the individuals who not only harassed her but then have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retaliated against her</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the statement notes: &#8220;Under New York law, California law, and indeed in every jurisdiction of the United States this lawsuit not only fails but may result in the Wayfarer Parties covering Ryan’s costs and attorneys’ fees for bringing such a frivolous case in the first place.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-win-or-lose-are-these-lawsuits-the-right-move-for-baldoni">Win or lose, are these lawsuits the right move for Baldoni?</h2>



<p>There have been previous allegations from Baldoni&#8217;s camp about Reynolds and Lively using their A-list influence against the director. </p>



<p>At least some of those have seemingly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been debunked</a>, though it may be up to the court to decide.</p>



<p>It is possible that Baldoni&#8217;s team has evidence and arguments that they have not yet made public. </p>



<p>If so, they could make a solid case and convince the court. It is unclear whether Baldoni will <em>ever</em> be more famous for something other than this bitter legal battle, however.</p>

<p>Is Blake Lively guilty of one of the same things that Justin Baldoni allegedly put her through on set?</p>



<p>An allegedly totally organic group of Lively haters (which already <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sounds familiar</a>) are accusing the actress of hypocrisy for her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-fires-back-accuses-justin-baldoni-of-inappropriate-touching/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual misconduct allegations</a> against Baldoni.</p>



<p>When Lively filmed <em>A Simple Favor</em> (truly a perfect movie), she &#8220;improvised&#8221; a grab of actor Henry Golding&#8217;s crotch. Baldoni stands accused of &#8220;improvising&#8221; kisses and touching as part of his sexual misconduct.</p>



<p>Are these the same actions? Did she do exactly what she accuses him of doing? Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-517091" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0117_blakelively_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Blake Lively attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-simple-favor-coming-back-to-bite-blake-lively">Is &#8216;A Simple Favor&#8217; coming back to bite Blake Lively?</h2>



<p>In the 2018 film, <em>A Simple Favor</em>, Henry Golding plays the husband of Blake Lively&#8217;s character.</p>



<p>During one intimate moment, her character grabs his crotch. This was not a body double for either of them, so the actress was grasping her co-star.</p>



<p>The scene is part of the film. It even appears to be scripted. However, behind-the-scenes commentary reveals otherwise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="A Simple Favor (2018 Movie) Official Trailer – Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Henry Golding" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAqMlh0b2HU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>In the Blu-Ray commentary, Lively shares that this moment was improvisation. It was, she explained, something that her character would do.</p>



<p>Director Paul Feig speaks warmly about Lively&#8217;s addition.</p>



<p>Lively also jokes about the inherent awkwardness of meeting someone and asking if you can grab them by the genitals.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-1024x682.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-522228" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_blakelively_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 02, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-was-not-a-unilateral-decision-though">This was not a unilateral decision, though &#8230;</h2>



<p>Director Feig then describes having to coach Lively on the crotch grab, asking her to grasp Golding more aggressively.</p>



<p>Despite the professional context and tone of this behind-the-scenes discussion, some on social media &#8212; whether this is an honest reaction or the result of astroturfing &#8212; are saying that this makes Lively a hypocrite.</p>



<p>Though Lively has mentioned numerous actions (and she is not the only actress to have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jenny-slate-complaint-it-ends-with-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported issues</a>), one of her complaints against Baldoni is that he improvised touching and kissing. Lively even had a meeting during production of the film to try to put an end to that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1024x669.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-520244" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-2048x1338.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-960x627.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1200x784.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Is it the same? Well, <em>no</em>. </p>



<p>The commentary notes that Lively asked Golding before grabbing his crotch. </p>



<p>Additionally, Golding himself spoke about filming intimate scenes back in 2018.</p>



<p>He said that all of that took place on a closed set, that he and his scene partner ran through things beforehand. </p>



<p>Golding also noted that there was deliberately room for decisions in the moment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-baldoni-is-accused-of-more-than-one-improvisation">Baldoni is accused of more than one &#8216;improvisation&#8217;</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Lively&#8217;s team fired back at Baldoni&#8217;s attempt to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/justin-baldonis-lawyer-fires-back-over-leaked-explosive-text-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depict the two</a> as getting along well as if that disproved the allegations. </p>



<p>(True or not, many people interact politely with people whom they fear or despise, especially if it&#8217;s for work)</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck,&#8221; her attorneys described.</p>



<p>Lively&#8217;s teams continued, listing: &#8220;flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character.&#8221; Yikes!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-1024x695.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-519605" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-1080x733.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_03-1200x815.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the UK Gala Screening of &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on August 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Lia Toby/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/04/02/blake-lively-improvised-a-simple-favor-scene-grabbing-henry-golding-crotch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> </em>spoke to a rep for Blake Lively, who further clarified: &#8220;Blake collaborated and reached agreement with the director and her co-star before filming the scene.&#8221;</p>



<p>The rep continued: &#8220;That is the entire point here and that is what Mr. Baldoni did not do. The audio commentary referenced clearly says that she made a creative suggestion, all agreed on it, and it was incorporated through the appropriate filmmaking process.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Baldoni on the other hand, who was Blake&#8217;s boss as the director and producer of the film and the head of the studio,&#8221; the rep highlighted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-these-accusations-the-same-obviously-not">Are these accusations the same? Obviously not &#8230;</h2>



<p>Lively&#8217;s rep noted that he &#8220;decided on his own, without asking first, that it was ok for him to bite and suck on Blake&#8217;s lower lip.&#8221;</p>



<p>This was allegedly &#8220;again without advance notice or asking for consent during a scene in which he continued to improvise more kissing on each take.&#8221;</p>



<p>The rep concluded: &#8220;This is just one example of the many in Blake&#8217;s lawsuit against Mr. Baldoni. The attempts to smear Blake have now come so full circle, that they are even starting to prove her own point.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ryan Reynolds is getting an earful from parent-shamers.</p>



<p>This time, it&#8217;s over a line that one of his very young children delivered in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/king-charles-deadpool-and-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</a></em> last summer.</p>



<p>The line in question is crass. It is also, some say, &#8220;sexually explicit.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are real questions about whether this backlash is about <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> &#8230; or if it&#8217;s part of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-amended-complaint-corroboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something else</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-casting-his-kid-in-deadpool-amp-wolverine-a-bad-parenting-move">Was casting his kid in &#8216;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8217; a bad parenting move?</h2>



<p>Parent-shamers are coming after Ryan Reynolds over a line that Kidpool delivers in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>.</p>



<p>As you may recall, towards the end of the film, a hoard of Deadpool variants from different timelines are on screen together. One of them is Kidpool.</p>



<p>Kidpool tells Deadpool (the main one &#8212; I refuse to pretend that the MCU is &#8220;Earth 616&#8221; because that is a comics continuity): &#8220;Hey, when I want your opinion, I&#8217;ll take Wolverine&#8217;s d&#8211;k out of your mouth.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Kid pool got No chill #deadpoolandwolverinetrailer #deadpool" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1PMtsZc1MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>And it was almost even edgier. We learn from the script on <a href="https://assets.debut.disney.com/documents/Deadpool_Book_Single_Pages.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney.com</a> that Kidpool originally had a slightly different line.</p>



<p>“Hey! When we want your opinion, I’ll take <em>my</em> d–k out of your mouth!” the original script reads.</p>



<p>Perhaps the line was changed because of the palpable sexual tension between <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>&#8216;s titular superheroes. </p>



<p>Or, perhaps, the line was changed because Deadpool and Kidpool&#8217;s actors are father and daughter.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds on July 22, 2024." class="wp-image-522398" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0328_ryanreynolds_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds attend the &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; New York Premiere on July 22, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-s-kidpool-he-s-the-dirtiest">&#8216;That&#8217;s Kidpool. He&#8217;s the dirtiest&#8217;</h2>



<p>As Nicepool says during the film: &#8220;That&#8217;s Kidpool. He&#8217;s the dirtiest.&#8221;</p>



<p>But in the latest edition of actors and characters not meshing, Inez Reynolds played Kidpool. Inez is Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively&#8217;s daughter, and was believed to have been 7 years old when this filmed.</p>



<p>Some children that age know and use crass anatomical terms. Others do not. Very few would say that kind of line &#8212; let alone for work, and almost never with a parent&#8217;s blessing.</p>

<p>Some commenters pointed out that, with so much of what we hear in films being ADR, someone could easily have dubbed the line. Kidpool wears a mask, after all.</p>



<p>“She’s the same age as my kid,&#8221; penned one commenter.</p>



<p> &#8220;I couldn’t imagine ANYTHING that would 1. get me to do this to my kid (or any kid) or 2. would be okay with my husband having done it.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-backlash-real-or-astroturfed">Is the backlash real, or astroturfed?</h2>



<p>An inside source spoke to <em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/28/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-under-fire-over-young-daughters-sexually-explicit-line-in-deadpool-amp-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a></em> about how, though certainly some reactions are authentic, the overall backlash nearly a year later might not be.</p>



<p>“Ryan talked about this months ago when the film came out and there was no negative reaction until a retaliation campaign was launched against him and Blake for Blake standing up against sexual harassment,&#8221; an inside source described.</p>



<p>“There are numerous other examples of actors having their own kids and young children saying outrageous and inappropriate things with no reaction other than laughs,&#8221; the insider added. That much is true.</p>



<p>We of course cannot confirm whether Justin Baldoni&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-motion-to-dismiss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged smear campaign</a> against Lively and Reynolds is behind this. But the timing of this discourse is, at the very least, worth noting.</p>

<p>Blake Lively allegedly followed a fan who filmed her &#8212; and filmed the fan right back.</p>



<p>Stories of crazed &#8220;fans&#8221; stalking celebrities are alarmingly common.</p>



<p>But what happens when someone famous &#8212; and currently under siege in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-amended-complaint-corroboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nasty legal battle</a> &#8212; turns the tables? </p>



<p>According to one (former) fan, the embattled actress did just that, straight up following her to her car.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-started-when-blake-lively-reportedly-visited-a-texas-hotel">It started when Blake Lively reportedly visited a Texas hotel</h2>



<p>According to an unusual interview with <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14500223/blake-lively-hotel-fan-video-disturbing-justin-baldoni.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, Kaitlyn Cooper is a woman who stayed with her mother at The Hotel 1928 in Waco, Texas on March 8. </p>



<p>Soon after arriving, Cooper says that she realized that a VIP was also staying there. It was not long before she learned that the important guest was Lively.</p>



<p>Apparently, a gossipy server shared that Lively was visiting to spend time with Joanna Gaines. Gaines, of HGTV fame, owns the hotel.</p>

<p>By her own <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaleidwithkait/video/7481823888528248095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admission</a>, when Cooper got her chance, she popped out her phone and began surreptitiously filming Lively in the hotel.</p>



<p>The actress soon realized that someone was filming her. So she used her hand to cover her face. Hotel staffers and a security guard escorted her as she continued.</p>



<p>“When she walked in [to the lobby], she was super loud. Her voice was extremely recognizable,” Cooper described. “I think she said hi to the two people at the front desk. She looked at us. I believe she spotted us [filming her].”</p>

<p>Cooper says that she did not see the actress again for the rest of the evening. She assumed that filming her briefly would be their sole encounter.</p>



<p>However, the following morning, she was in the parking lot packing things up. Allegedly, Lively then approached her &#8212; wielding a phone of her own.</p>



<p>“We were loading up our car and I heard [someone say], ‘Hi,’ and it was a woman’s voice,” Cooper narrated. “I looked up, and see [Lively]. She’s got her phone up [like she’s recording me]. Out of instinct, I just said ‘hi’ back, because what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I was really caught off guard,” Cooper admitted, describing Lively as seemingly trying to get a good shot of her license plate. </p>



<p>“She then handed her phone off to her security guy and he did another lap around the passenger side and then they both went back in,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;We were just confused about what was happening.”</p>



<p>When she shared her experience on her Instagram Story, Cooper says that &#8220;strange&#8221; accounts viewed it. She believes that someone possibly from Lively&#8217;s team may have viewed it &#8212; as if checking to see if she would share the encounter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-would-a-celebrity-confront-and-film-a-seemingly-random-fan">Why would a celebrity confront and film a seemingly random fan?</h2>



<p>Obviously, we cannot attest that any of this happened. But many on social media are already speculating about what happened.</p>



<p>The first explanation is that Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds are currently in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-stakes legal battle</a>. Already the target of a prolonged smear campaign, it is possible that Lively feared that she was being recorded for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-info-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nefarious courtroom purposes</a>.</p>



<p>The second explanation, however, seems more likely. Even the most famous and beautiful people sometimes feel exhausted with being recorded without their consent. And, famously, sometimes they exercise poor judgment in how they respond. It happens &#8230; and it never goes well for the celeb in question.</p>

<p>Blake Lively is filing to dismiss the massive lawsuit that Justin Baldoni filed against her.</p>



<p>Just as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/ryan-reynolds-to-justin-baldoni-you-cant-sue-me-for-being-mean-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Reynolds hit back</a> at Baldoni, his wife is also hoping that the court can nip this $400 million battle in the bud.</p>



<p>However, Lively&#8217;s filing takes a different angle than her husband&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Her legal team argues that because Baldoni is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing her for revenge</a>, the malicious intention makes the lawsuit <em>illegal</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/20/blake-lively-motion-dismiss-justin-baldoni-defamation-lawsuit-it-ends-with-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>TMZ </em>reports</a> that on Thursday, March 20, Blake Lively filed a motion to dismiss Justin Baldoni&#8217;s lawsuit against her.</p>



<p>She notes that Baldoni&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million lawsuit</a> against her, her husband, and her publicist came <em>after </em>she alleged that he had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexually harassed her</a> during the making of <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>Additionally, Lively&#8217;s filing points to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smear campaign</a> that hounded her for months in late 2024 following her reporting his alleged misconduct to the studio.</p>

<p>How does this make his lawsuit (potentially) illegal?</p>



<p>Blake Lively&#8217;s legal team points out that California law against retaliatory lawsuits bars Justin Baldoni from, well, filing this kind of retaliatory lawsuit.</p>



<p>It will be up to the court to determine whether this law applies to this particular legal struggle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-justin-baldoni-is-only-making-his-case-worse-blake-lively-s-legal-team-argues">Justin Baldoni is only making his case worse, Blake Lively&#8217;s legal team argues</h2>



<p>Blake Lively&#8217;s attorneys say that Justin Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, his company, have &#8220;created more liability for themselves.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the legal filing, they have done so &#8220;by their malicious efforts to sue Ms. Lively &#8216;into oblivion.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively&#8217;s team is asking the court to have Baldoni pay her legal fees alongside substantial financial damages for having filed the suit in the first place.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Justin Baldoni on December 13, 2023." class="wp-image-521788" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0320_justinbaldoni_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends &#8220;The Boys In The Boat&#8221; New York Screening at Museum of Modern Art on December 13, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Within the filing, Blake Lively and her attorneys also hit back at Justin Baldoni&#8217;s narrative that she and Ryan Reynolds are <em>bullying </em>him using their status as Hollywood A-listers.</p>



<p>The document states that Baldoni, who directed <em>It Ends With Us</em> under the auspices of his company producing the film (in which he also starred opposite Lively), is the bully in this scenario.</p>



<p>Why? Because the lawsuit is &#8220;designed to further [Baldoni&#8217;s] sinister campaign to &#8216;bury&#8217; and &#8216;destroy&#8217; Ms. Lively for speaking out about sexual harassment and retaliation.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-court-grand-the-motion-to-dismiss">Will the court grand the motion to dismiss?</h2>



<p>It is unclear whether Blake Lively or Ryan Reynolds&#8217; motions to dismiss against Justin Baldoni will be successful.</p>



<p>The judge will want to take time to review the law itself and case law. </p>



<p>There could also be multiple hearings on the topic, in which both sides will argue whether or not the California law against retaliatory lawsuits applies to this particular retaliatory lawsuit.</p>



<p>It would be nice for many of those involved if this miserable nightmare could come to an end. As things stand, the legal standoff could continue for over a year.</p>

<p>Blake Lively is remembering Michelle Trachtenberg in the wake of the iconic actress&#8217; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-dead-at-39/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking death</a>.</p>



<p>While fans pore over <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-final-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trachtenberg&#8217;s final posts</a> for clues, Lively actually knew her.</p>



<p>Lively rose to fame starring as Serena van der Woodsen on <em>Gossip Girl</em>. Trachtenberg portrayed recurring antagonist Georgina Sparks. She even reprised the role on the reboot.</p>



<p>Trachtenberg wasn&#8217;t just a generational star to Lively. She was a friend and co-star.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-lively-is-memorializing-the-late-michelle-trachtenberg">Blake Lively is memorializing the late Michelle Trachtenberg</h2>



<p>Unlike most of the millions reeling in shock at the sudden passing of Michelle Trachtenberg, Blake Lively actually knew her. As she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-dead-at-39-stars-react-to-stunning-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reacted</a> to the tragic news, her memories came from behind the scenes &#8212; not from a screen.</p>



<p>“This is the first day I met Michelle,” Lively wrote on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blakelively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story on Wednesday alongside a photo of the two.</p>



<p>“She was electricity. You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed,&#8221; she characterized. &#8220;Everything she did, she did 200%.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1024x669.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-520244" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-2048x1338.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-960x627.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_01-1200x784.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“She laughed the fullest at someone’s joke, she faced authority head-on when she felt something was wrong,&#8221; Blake Lively praised of Michelle Trachtenberg. </p>



<p>&#8220;She cared deeply about her work,&#8221; she affirmed.</p>



<p>Lively added: &#8220;She was proud to be a part of this community and industry as painful as it could be sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake Lively went on to describe the late Michelle Trachtenberg as she remembers her.</p>



<p>She praised her former co-star as having been “fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved.”</p>



<p>Growing more specific, Lively recalled how Trachtenberg carried caramel lipgloss because she &#8220;cared about the sweet details.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on October 28, 2024." class="wp-image-520246" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0227_blakelively_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the 2024 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on October 28, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Time passes,” Blake Lively somberly acknowledged. “You take for granted that you get the chance to see an old friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;To paraphrase, the real tragedies in life are the ones that blindside you on an idle Tuesday.” That line seems to be paraphrasing Mary Schmich, specifically.</p>



<p>“The world lost a deeply sensitive and good person in Michelle,&#8221; Lively concluded. &#8220;May her work and her huge heart be remembered by those who were lucky enough to experience her fire.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-still-so-much-that-we-do-not-know">There is still so much that we do not know</h2>



<p>As we reported on Wednesday, Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s mother discovered her early in the morning that day. </p>



<p>The 39-year-old actress had reportedly gone into cardiac arrest. First responders declared her dead at the scene.</p>



<p>We still do not know the cause of death. News that she had reportedly received a liver transplant fairly recently has led people to make many guesses &#8212; without confirmation.</p>



<p>For now, all that we can do is mourn her passing. Michelle Trachtenberg entertained an entire generation from childhood and into adulthood.</p>

<p>Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni.</p>



<p>This legal update comes as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldoni&#8217;s $400 million lawsuit</a> against Lively, her husband, and the New York Times (after the <em>NYT </em>reported on his alleged <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-fires-back-accuses-justin-baldoni-of-inappropriate-touching/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual misconduct</a>) shows no end in sight.</p>



<p>According to Lively&#8217;s attorneys, she was not the only one to voice complaints about Baldoni&#8217;s alleged behavior on the set of <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>The existence of other complaints could fly in the face of Baldoni&#8217;s timeline &#8212; and his claim that Lively fabricated her complaints as part of a creative struggle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-lively-has-filed-an-amended-complaint">Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint</h2>



<p>Putting together a case to file a lawsuit can take time. But even then, sometimes people need to update their court case ahead of trial.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, February 18, Blake Lively filed an amended complaint in New York federal court. The 163-page document adds to her December 31 lawsuit against Justin Baldoni.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://people.com/blake-lively-files-amended-complaint-justin-baldoni-11680275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> reports that, according to her attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, the filing &#8220;provides significant additional evidence and corroboration of her original claims&#8221; and also &#8220;includes previously undisclosed communications&#8221; involving Lively, Sony, Wayfarer Studios and &#8220;numerous other witnesses.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-519604" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; photocall at IET Building: Savoy Place on August 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Sony Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, the attorneys noted that Blake Lively&#8217;s amended complaint &#8220;also added a new claim for defamation.&#8221;</p>



<p>They added that the defamation claim is &#8220;based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively since she filed her original complaint, and adds Jed Wallace and his company as defendants.&#8221; </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-hit-with-6-million-defamation-lawsuit-from-justin-baldonis-pr-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallace is suing Lively</a> after she described Baldoni as using his PR firm to run a smear campaign against her. Late last year, many saw screenshots of communications in which he appeared to be doing exactly that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-blake-lively-s-amended-complaint-say">What does Blake Lively&#8217;s amended complaint say?</h2>



<p>One portion of the amended complaint has attorneys for Blake Lively write that Baldoni&#8217;s &#8220;false narrative crumbles under the indisputable truth.&#8221;</p>



<p>The filing notes that Lively &#8220;was not alone in complaining about Mr. Baldoni and raised her concerns contemporaneously as they arose in 2023.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is an important point. Her attorneys continue, saying that she spoke about this in 2023 and &#8220;not in connection with some imagined power play for control of the film in 2024.&#8221; Baldoni&#8217;s argument has been that Lively fabricated allegations of misconduct as part of a creative power struggle, but her team says that this does not match the timeline.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-519606" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the photocall for &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; at the IET London on August 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, a spokesperson for Blake Lively specifies that the amended complaint &#8220;details the corroboration that backs up Blake’s original sexual harassment and retaliation concerns.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to this statement, the filing demonstrates that &#8220;other women confided in Blake about their discomfort and fear of coming forward, and their concern about the current public vitriol.&#8221;</p>



<p>There were indications during the initial press tour for <em>It Ends With Us</em> that some of Blake Lively&#8217;s costars were reluctant to discuss Justin Baldoni in any way. It is possible that some of them will end up testifying in court in a year &#8212; and giving depositions before then.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-will-not-go-to-trial-until-may-2026">This will not go to trial until May 2026</h2>



<p>This next year or so will likely be full of back-and-forth filings in the courtroom.</p>



<p>The judge has discouraged both parties from saying anything to taint a potential jury pool. That has not stopped Lively and her husband from making a brief <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-snl-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>SNL </em>cameo</a>, or Baldoni from publishing alleged, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-texts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cherrypicked texts</a> to a website that seems dedicated to influencing public opinion.</p>



<p>Public opinion is a fickle thing and easily influenced, especially through disinformation vectors like TikTok. There is no telling what this case will look like in the eye of everyday people (who have not read the legal filings) by the time that it goes to trial.</p>



<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd/app.bsky.feed.post/3lik26akgqk2b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihuoh4zbmlzdmyujvcawkskhhbv65dxe63dj3ytfq2cp2yzf4ahdu"><p lang="en">Justin Baldoni’s billionaire backer threatened to protect Wayfarer “like Israel protected itself from Hamas” if Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds dared to speak up months after It Ends With Us wrapped.

“There were 39,000 dead bodies. There will be two dead bodies when I’m done.”<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd/post/3lik26akgqk2b?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Molly McAleer (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd?ref_src=embed">@molls.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd/post/3lik26akgqk2b?ref_src=embed">February 19, 2025 at 10:01 AM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>And people who have not read the legal filings are missing some key details. For example, Steve Sarowitz, a partner in Wayfarer Studios, seemingly vowed to &#8220;protect&#8221; the studio with massive retaliation.</p>



<p>According to Lively&#8217;s filing, Sarowitz vowed to a witness to go after Lively and Reynolds if they spoke out against Baldoni. &#8220;I will protect the studio like Israel protected itself from Hamas,&#8221; Sarowitz allegedly threatened, referring to the genocide perpetrated in Gaza. &#8220;There were 39,000 dead bodies. There will be two dead bodies when I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>



<p>If this quoted text is true, it might explain Baldoni&#8217;s massive lawsuit against Lively, Reynolds, and a major newspaper. And, if other allegations are true, this sort of backing could hypothetically explain why an actor and director could feel that he could act however he wishes towards an A-list costar with impunity. </p>

<p>Blake Lively believes that Justin Baldoni just dug his own grave.</p>



<p>As most celebrity gossip followers know at this point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">Blake Lively recently accused </a>the actor of sexual harassment on the set It Ends With Us&#8230; alleging her co-star created a toxic work environment and also took part in a smear campaign against his colleague after the film&#8217;s release.</p>



<p>In response, Baldoni denied the allegations.</p>



<p>Then, lawyers for the the 40-year old filed a $400 million lawsuit in the Southern District of New York on January 16 on behalf of Baldoni, producer Jamey Heath, publicist Jennifer Abel and crisis publicist Melissa Nathan.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="976" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-1024x976.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517410" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-1024x976.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-300x286.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-768x732.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-2048x1953.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-960x915.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-1080x1030.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181619889-1200x1144.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the 2024 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on October 28, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/justin-baldoni-responds-to-bombshell-blake-lively-lawsuit/">Baldoni previously said Lively</a> was &#8220;consistently unable to take direction&#8221; throughout the shooting of the adaptation of Colleen Hoover&#8217;s book. </p>



<p>The director of this film, Baldoni also claimed Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds hijacked It Ends With Us via script re-writes and launched a smear campaign against him when &#8220;her thoughtless promotions fell flat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Overall, Baldoni is taking legal action on allegations of civil extortion… defamation… false light invasion of privacy… breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing… intentional interference with contractual relations… intentional interference with prospective economic advantage… and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, meanwhile, he tried to provide evidence of his side by releasing behind the scenes footage from It Ends With Us.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508061" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 6, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This footage features Baldoni and Lively talking and laughing during a romantic scene, with the pair seemingly getting along as they chatted about the most effective way to film this moment in the movie.</p>



<p>Proof that Baldoni was respectful and the two worked well together, right?</p>



<p>WRONG, Lively now says.</p>



<p>&#8220;Justin Baldoni and his lawyer may hope that this latest stunt will get ahead of the damaging evidence against him, but the video itself is damning,&#8221; Lively&#8217;s attorneys said on January 21. </p>



<p>&#8220;The video shows Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character.&#8221;</p>

<p>These lawyers alleged that &#8220;every moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.&#8221;</p>



<p>They added:</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively’s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively’s boss. The video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively has said that Baldoni showed her lewd photos while filming, often brought up the topic of pornography and generally made her feel disrespected and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The Gossip Girl alum&#8217;s counsel doubled down on Tuesday: </p>



<p>&#8220;Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively’s discomfort. They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.&#8221;</p>



<p>In this message, Lively&#8217;s legal team also accused Baldoni of presenting an &#8220;unethical attempt to manipulate the public&#8221; through the release of the behind-the-scenes footage.</p>



<p>As you can tell, things are just getting uglier and uglier between these two.</p>

<p>In a January 21 response, Baldoni&#8217;s lawyers said that it is &#8220;his right to publicly defend himself by putting forth actual facts and evidence,&#8221; continuing:</p>



<p>&#8220;Ms. Lively wants very different standards to apply to her but fortunately, truth and authenticity apply to everyone and can never be wrong. Looking at the video and the evidence to come, I can understand why Ms. Lively would now, not want this to play out in public.</p>
