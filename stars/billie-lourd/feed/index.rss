										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The late, great Carrie Fisher died on December 27, 2016.</p>
<p>Fans mourned her, but her daughter Billie Lourd misses her most of all.</p>
<p>Last year, she <a href="/2017/12/carrie-fisher-mourned-remembed-one-year-after-death/">mourned and remembered Carrie</a>. This year, she&#8217;s doing something a little different.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Billie Lourd is mourning the loss of her incomparable mother, Carrie Fisher, two years later.</p>
<p>In an Instagram video that we have included for you, Billie sings a somber but beautiful tune.</p>
<p>In the captions, she provides a little context.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been two years since my Momby&rsquo;s death,&quot; Billie begins.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she admits. &quot;I still don&rsquo;t know what the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do on a death anniversary is.&quot;</p>
<p>None of us who have grappled with the sudden loss of a loved one do.</p>
<p>&quot;(I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you feel the same way about your loved ones),&quot; Billie acknowledges.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="854" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-854x1024.jpg" alt="Billie Lourd and Carrie Fisher Together" class="wp-image-268846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-854x1024.jpg 854w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-250x300.jpg 250w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-768x921.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-1281x1536.jpg 1281w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-1708x2048.jpg 1708w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-735x881.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-279x335.jpg 279w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-289x347.jpg 289w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-434x520.jpg 434w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-534x640.jpg 534w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-641x768.jpg 641w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-801x960.jpg 801w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/billie-lourd-and-carrie-fisher-together-901x1080.jpg 901w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; she writes. &quot;I decided to do something a little vulnerable for me,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Billie continues, it is &quot;something we both loved to do together &#8211; sing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the piano her father gave her,&quot; she shares. &quot;And this was one of her favorite songs.&quot;</p>
<p>Billie says: &quot;And as the song says, &#8216;we must &ldquo;keep on moving.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>That is a helpful message.</p>

<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve found that what keeps me moving,&quot; she shares. &quot;Is doing things that make me happy,&quot;</p>
<p>She is absolutely right! No one&#8217;s loved ones would want for them to be miserable on their behalf.</p>
<p>Billie has found that she is in better spirits when she is &quot;working hard on the things that I&rsquo;m passionate about.&quot;</p>
<p>Right again. You get into the groove of whatever it is that you do, and you can&#8217;t help but be a little happier.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Billie writes, she thrives by &quot;surrounding myself with people I love and making them smile.&quot;</p>
<p>That should be a very easy task for her. She is a delight.</p>

<p>She continues: &quot;I hope this encourages anyone feeling a little low or lost to &#8216;keep on moving.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As my Momby once said, &ldquo;&#8217;take your broken heart and turn it into art,&#8217;&rdquo; Billie writes.</p>
<p>Carrie very notably said and sang that line at her one-woman show, arguably the only one-woman show ever worth seeing.</p>
<p>Billie encourages her fans and followers and fellow mourners to follow that advice: &quot;whatever that art may be for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Great, now <em>we&#8217;re</em> crying.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Billie had a larger role in her mother&#8217;s final <em>Star Wars</em> film.</p>
<p>Carrie Fisher&#8217;s sudden and tragic passing meant complications for filmmakers, who want to honor her legacy while still telling their story.</p>
<p>The Last Jedi was also mired in controversy as a divisive film.</p>
<p>Though the majority of audiences enjoyed the film, many people felt that it had problems with pacing, worldbuilding, and characterization.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, more nuanced criticisms were drowned out by racists and misogynists who have a problem with women and people of color.</p>
<p>Those monsters made discussion of the film difficult, and many feel that Carrie herself could have brought fans together.</p>
<p>More than anything, people feel that Carrie&#8217;s legacy deserves better than the controversy and perhaps better than that particular <em>Star Wars</em> film.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t about the fans or about <em>Star Wars</em>, even though both were huge factors in Carrie&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>This is about her daughter.</p>
<p>Billie Lourd is a young and dazzling talent, and Carrie was her mother. Is her mother.</p>
<p>We all call Carrie Fisher space mom, but that&#8217;s Billie&#8217;s reality.</p>
<p>Losing her &#8212; and losing her grandmother, Debbie Reynolds, the next day &#8212; was tragic and traumatic.</p>
<p>Words cannot undo this terrible loss for her, but we wish the best for Billie.</p>

<p><a href="/2016/12/carrie-fisher-dies-beloved-star-wars-actress-was-60/">Carrie Fisher had passed away</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The beloved actress had fallen unconscious a couple days prior to Christmas after suffering a heart attack and finally succumbed to the after-effects on December 27, 2017.</p>
<p>Exactly 365 days ago today.</p>
<p>Immediately following her death, tributes and words of mourning poured forth from all who knew the legendary actress well.</p>
<p>And even from those who were just familiar with her work, such was the profound impact Fisher had on so many individuals.</p>
<p>Now, on the anniversary of her death, two of the most important people in Carrie&#8217;s life have spoken out once again.</p>

<p>First, her daughter, Billie Lourd.</p>
<p>&quot;My momby had an otherworldly obsession with the northern lights, but I never got to see them with her,&quot; Lourd wrote on social media on Wednesday.</p>
<p>She added:</p>
<p>&quot;We journeyed to northern Norway to see if we might &#8216;see the heavens lift up her dark skirts and flash her dazzling privates across [our] unworthy irises.&#8217; And she did.&quot;</p>
<p>In a beautiful and simple conclusion, the young actress wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;I love you times infinity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In just an hour, the post reached close to 50,000 Likes, with many users expressing their love and support in the Comments section.</p>

<p>Then there was Mark Hamill.</p>
<p>The actor, who co-starred in a number of Star Wars films with Fisher and who had a special bond with the late star, took to Twitter this afternoon and wrote the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s ever really gone&#8230;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He penned this caption along with the hashtags &quot;#AlwaysWithUs&quot; and &quot;#CarrieOnForever&quot; and a photo of the stars together.</p>
<p>This photo was itself alongside a drawing of Fisher and her beloved dog, Gary, which is &#8230; well&#8230; totally awesome.</p>
<p>See for yourself:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As many movie fans also know, director Rian Johnson recently paid tribute himself to Fisher in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.</p>
<p>Shortly after the credits, a dedication appears onscreen that reads: &quot;In Loving Memory of Our Princess, Carrie Fisher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to dedicate tonight to Carrie, who is up there right now flipping me the bird, saying, &#8216;Damn it, Rian, don&#8217;t you dare make this night a solemn tribute,&#8217;&quot; the director joked at the film&#8217;s premiere earlier this month, adding simply:</p>
<p>&quot;So let&#8217;s all have a blast tonight for Carrie.&quot;</p>
<p>The veteran <a href="/2017/01/carrie-fisher-cause-of-death-released-questions-remain/">star&#8217;s cause of death</a> was eventually revealed to be from sleep apnea and &quot;other undetermined factors.&quot;</p>
<p>May she continue to rest in peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Billie Lourd has given her first interview since she suffered not one, but two unimaginable losses in the span of just over 24 hours last December.</p>
<p>First, the young actress said goodbye to her mother, beloved Star Wars icon Carrie Fisher.</p>
<p>Then, the very next day, Lourd&#8217;s grandmother (and Fisher&#8217;s mother), Debbie Reynolds, also passed away.</p>

<p>Lourd, best known in the entertainment world for her role on Scream Queens, has <a href="/2017/01/billie-lourd-breaks-silence-thanks-fans-for-well-wishes/">commented here and there about the tragic deaths</a> via her Instagram page.</p>
<p>But she opens up in major detail for the first time in this Q&amp;A with Town &amp; Country.</p>
<p>Speaking to American Horror Story star Sarah Paulson for the latest issue&#8217;s cover story, Lourd contrasts life with her organized father against that of her famously chaotic mother.</p>
<p>&quot;He gets home at the same time every day, and we eat dinner together, we do homework together, we watch Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and cry, and then go to sleep,&quot; Lourd explained of living with her dad.</p>
<p>&quot;At Mom&#8217;s it was like, &#8216;Let&#8217;s put Christmas lights in the palm trees at 2 a.m.&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember when Sharper Image was 24 hours? We went there all the time, 1 a.m. or 3 a.m., just picking up little trinkets&#8230; as if that was what you do!&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Both Fisher and Reynolds became household names in the entertainment industry, but Lourd says neither wanted her to follow in their acting footsteps.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in a normal family they would have looked at me and been like, &#8216;Hey, this kid&#8217;s a performer.&#8217; But I was so scared. I was embarrassed, honestly,&quot; she tells the publication, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Because they were like, &#8216;This is going to be a really s&#8211;tty lifestyle, and everyone&#8217;s going to be scrutinizing you deeply and constantly.&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;My mom wrote five books and a one-woman show; they didn&#8217;t want more things for people to be able to Google about me.&quot;</p>
<p>Fisher was known for being outspoken. At absolutely all times.</p>
<p>Lourd&nbsp;says she was initially turned off by just how honest and raw her mother was &#8211; on stage, writing in books or when speaking to reporters &#8211; but she eventually came to admire it.</p>
<p>Now, Billie says she wants to emuluate Fisher.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking back and watching her interviews, I try to model what I do after her. She was so good at it. She would get so annoyed with me if I ever did a fake interview.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;d say, &#8216;Tell the real story.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>Billie says she surprised everyone (including herself) with how comfortable she felt on the set of her first film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens &#8211; and her family quickly became supportive of her burgeoning career at this small role.</p>
<p>&quot;Debbie was still encouraging me to put an act together. Literally three days before she died, she was like, &#8216;What numbers are you going to put in your act? Who are you going to impersonate?&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t think people do acts as much anymore,&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And she came back, &#8216;That&#8217;s why if you do one you&#8217;ll be more successful than anyone else. The act is a dying art, and someone needs to revive it.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Lourd says she&rsquo;s keeping her mother&rsquo;s compound (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so magical.&rdquo;) and that she relied on humor to get her through the hardest week of her life:</p>
<p>&quot;If life&#8217;s not funny, then it&#8217;s just true &#8211; and that would be unacceptable,&quot; she says, quoting her mom.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when she died, that was what got me through that whole thing.</p>
<p>&quot;When Debbie died the next day, I could just picture her saying, &#8216;Well, she&#8217;s upstaging me once again, of course &#8211; she had to.&quot;</p>

<p>Billie, of course, would give anything to have her loved ones alive and back in her life.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s an opportunity now for her to become more independent.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve always kind of lived in their shadows, and now is the first time in my life when I get to own my life and stand on my own,&quot; she says.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love being my mother&#8217;s daughter, and it&#8217;s something I always will be, but now I get to be just Billie.&quot;</p>
<p>When was the last time she saw her mom alive? What does she think her mother would say to her now?</p>
<p>&quot;The last time I saw her in person, this episode of Scream Queens was on, and it was a big episode for me.</p>
<p>&quot;I had tons of scenes, and I was so hard on myself about it &#8211; I hated how I looked, hated my performance. I was really frustrated. She told me, &#8216;Come over right now. I want to watch this with you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;And she made me sit down and watch it, and she forced me to see the good parts. She was incredible like that.</p>
<p>&quot;But she was really hard on me, saying, &#8216;Shut up. You&#8217;re great in this. Have faith in yourself. Be more confident.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>In conclusion, Lourd is in as much awe of her late mother&#8217;s honesty as any Star Wars fan out there.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s good to be authentic, to help other people, but if it&#8217;s not helping other people, then don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a couple incidents I wish she could have kept to herself. But, you know, that was the beauty of her.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Billie Lourd went through what we hope will be the hardest experience of her life last December, and boyfriend Taylor Lautner was there by her side for that. Even as recently as May, the two still seemed joined at the hip, attending a Britney Spears concert together and posting about it.</p>
<p>But for over a month now, they&#8217;ve both seemed to ignore each other on social media, declining even to &quot;like&quot; each other&#8217;s photos. People noticed and wondered if something was up.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like this young, unspeakably beautiful couple has called it quits.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Billie Lourd is one of the stars of Ryan Murphy&#8217;s <em>Scream Queens</em> and she appeared in <em>Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens</em>, but the world knows her best as Carrie Fisher&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>And, of course, as Debbie Reynolds&#8217; granddaughter.</p>
<p>Fans knew who she was, but she became impossible to miss after <a href="/2016/12/carrie-fisher-dies-beloved-star-wars-actress-was-60/">Carrie Fisher&#8217;s tragic death</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no insult to her budding career.</p>
<p>Taylor Lautner might not have such famous relatives, but he&#8217;s extremely well-known.</p>
<p>Mostly, even now, for his role in the <em>Twilight </em>series that made no shortage of grown women tweet all <em>sorts </em>of things before finding out that he was only 17 when <em>New Moon</em> came out.</p>
<p>The guy&#8217;s got abs for days.</p>
<p>Together, they were a lovely couple.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This is no longer just speculation based on who does and doesn&#8217;t double-tap photos on Instagram.</p>
<p><a href="http://people.com/movies/billie-lourd-taylor-lautner-split/">Billie Lourd and Taylor Lautner have broken up</a> for realsies, according to <em>People</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;They aren&rsquo;t together anymore but they are still friendly,&quot; their source says.</p>
<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s really focused on her work right now.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s more than understandable.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not going to make this about Carrie Fisher&#8217;s death and Billie throwing herself into her work to cope.</p>
<p>(Though that could be a factor)</p>
<p>Billie is only at the start of what could be a long and epic career, and she surely wants to be taken seriously as an actress.</p>
<p>But we really don&#8217;t know what brought about this split.</p>
<p>And though Billie Lourd included the term &quot;Eiffel Tower&quot; in the captions of this photo of herself with Taylor Lautner and John Stamos a while back &#8230; we don&#8217;t think that this breakup was caused by post-threesome fallout.</p>
<p>(Probably)</p>
<p>She might not even know that Eiffel Tower is a sex position &#8230; even though that level of naivete would be hard to imagine in anyone her age, especially Carrie Fisher&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Whatever the cause, gone are the days when Billie Lourd <em>appears </em>to post about wanting a threesome with John Stamos.</p>
<p>(Maybe)</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not going to fall into that trap of bemoaning a couple breaking up just because we got used to the idea of them as a couple.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both young and talented and beautiful.</p>
<p>(Yes, even Taylor Lautner, who we <em>swear </em>wasn&#8217;t just hired for his almost comically perfect body &#8230; probably)</p>
<p>They have their whole lives ahead of them.</p>
<p>Billie and Taylor will always have their memories, but life usually involves a whole bunch of different lovers before you find your perfect match.</p>
<p>If you ever do.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We hope that they&#8217;re both doing okay, emotionally.</p>
<p>Breakups are hard.</p>
<p>And we especially hope for the best for Billie, because let&#8217;s not pretend that seven months is enough time to get over losing two of the most important people in your life.</p>
<p>Honestly, <em>I&#8217;m</em> still not over Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to imagine that she is.</p>
<p>But <a href="/2017/06/billie-lourd-speaks-out-about-carrie-fishers-toxicology-report/">Billie Lourd is well-spoken</a> and a skilled actress.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s amazing and she can do anything.</p>
