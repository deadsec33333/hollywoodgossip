<p>So, what&#8217;s fact and what&#8217;s fiction? What&#8217;s rumor and what&#8217;s reality? Is Snooki headed towards a divorce?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meet-snooki-s-husband-jionni">Meet Snooki&#8217;s Husband, Jionni</h2>



<p>Nicole Polizzi and Jionni LaValle met just how every young couple at the shore does: at the nightclub Karma. In fact, Nicole was filming season 3 of <em>Jersey Shore</em> at the time, but Jionni didn&#8217;t make much of a first impression. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s cute. He&#8217;ll do for tonight,&#8217; &#8221; Snooki recalled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZDm7BxGE1Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Larry King Now</em></a> in 2018.</p>



<p>But all that changed the more she spent time with Jionni and that more she got to know him. It actually didn&#8217;t take too long for her to change her tune, and realizing she had finally found her &#8220;nice, juiced, hot, tan guy&#8221; at last!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I want to marry you!&#8217; &#8221; Niole <a href="https://people.com/tv/snooki-pregnant-engaged-meet-jionni-lavalle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told PEOPLE</a> in 2011, recalling the moment she realized she wanted to spend the rest of her life with LaValle. &#8220;I know he&#8217;s the one.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">The couple went on to have two children, son Lorenzo and daughter Giovanna, before marrying at the St. Rose of Lima Church in East Hanover, New Jersey, on Nov. 29, 2014. Polizzi and LaValle welcomed their third child, son Angelo, in 2019.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-snooki-divorce-rumors-how-they-started">The Snooki Divorce Rumors: How They Started</h2>



<p>As a celebrity couple, the rumors of a split can pop up as soon as, well, the groom puts a ring on it! In Snooki&#8217;s case, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/hulk-hogan-divorce-wife-sex-tape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="500">divorce rumors</a> have sprung up constantly over their 10 year marriage. But it hit a pique in 2024. </p>



<p>The latest round of speculation began when Mike &#8220;The Situation&#8221; Sorrentino posted photos from daughter Mia Bella’s first birthday party.</p>



<p>Several <em>Shore</em> stars were on hand for the event, including Angelina Pivarnik, Jenni “JWoww” Farley and Sammi “Sweetheart” Giancola.</p>



<p>But Jionni was nowhere to be found, and some fans were curious about his absence.</p>



<p>One person even commented on the pic to ask why Snooki’s husband was “never around ever.”</p>



<p>Now, Nicole has been famous for long enough that she must know that there&#8217;s little to be gained by replying to trolls.</p>



<p>But Snooki&#8217;s patience has its limits, just like everyone else&#8217;s, and she&#8217;s clearly sick of hearing the same accusations over and over.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-snooki-hiding-divorce-from-the-public">Is Snooki Hiding Divorce From The Public?</h2>



<p>Six months later, despite their denials, another report sprung up from The US Sun, suggesting that not only was Snooki headed towards divorce, but that she was already living apart of Jionni. </p>



<p>&#8220;They stay apart a lot of the time. Within the last several months she said she hadn&#8217;t seen Jionni in a while and that he had left the house,&#8221; the souce claimed to the outlet.</p>



<p>In fact, the insider insisted that the couple actually live separately in the two homes they own in New Jersey.</p>



<p>However, when they are under the same roof &#8211; for the sake of the kids and appearances &#8211;&nbsp; they don&#8217;t sleep in the same bed, the source claimed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nicole will sleep in her bed with the kids, and Jionni will be in another bedroom and won&#8217;t get into their bed till she leaves.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s always said she doesn&#8217;t have the best relationship, she says it in front of everyone all the time, but it never airs,&#8221; a second source told <em>The U.S. Sun.</em></p>



<p>Hard to know what to believe, but given how forthcoming Snooki has been about every detail of her life the last few decades, if there were problems, we think she&#8217;d tell us! </p>

<p>On a recent episode of <em>Jersey Shore</em>, the cast ganged up on Angelina Pivarnick for concealing certain details of her personal life.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a common issue among reality show co-stars, which makes sense.</p>



<p>After all, if everyone is getting paid equally for sharing their lives on camera, shouldn&#8217;t they be required to share roughly the same amount?</p>



<p>But on social media, viewers didn&#8217;t care for <em>Shore</em> stars&#8217; argument, and many of them pointed out that Snooki has been keeping important aspects of her home life under wraps for years.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Specifically, Snooki&#8217;s husband,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/snooki-to-fans-fine-heres-the-real-reason-my-husband-never-appears-on-jersey-shore/"> Jionni LaValle, has steered clear of the cameras</a> since 2018.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <em>Shore</em> fans were quick to call out the hypocrisy.</p>



<p>“Where is your husband?? [Because] we’re missing that WHOLE part of your life,” one person tweeted.</p>



<p>Snooki is generally not one to concern herself with criticism from the haters, but on this occasion, she felt the need to explain herself.</p>



<p>“He has severe anxiety and hates being [in front] of [the] camera,&#8221; Snooks tweeted.</p>



<p>“He never liked it. He hardly lets me post pictures. It’s a mental health issue that I respect and choose not to push him to be on camera. But please, proceed to be nasty about it. It’s fine. Good day, ma’am.”</p>



<p>Her explanation jibes with what she and Jionni have been saying about the situation for years.</p>



<p>“Hey guys, I’m going to visit this subject one time and one time only,” LaValle wrote on Instagram in 2018, after he stepped away from Shore for good. </p>

<p></p>



<p>“My wife is filming a scene packing up and leaving for her new show and I AM CHOOSING TO NOT be on TV because I simply DO NOT like it,&#8221; he further explained.</p>



<p>Despite the couple&#8217;s assurances, many fans have jumped to the conclusion that Snooki and Jionni&#8217;s marriage is in trouble.</p>



<p>Possibly in response to those rumors, Snooks posted a rare photo of herself with Jionni over the long holiday weekend.</p>



<p></p>



<p>“You’re no picnic, alright?!” Snooki captioned the post. </p>



<p>“You’re a spoiled little brat even. Under that, you’re the most amazing, astounding, wonderful boy … man that I’ve ever known. #illneverletgo&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, that caption might be cause for concern on its own, but Snooks proceeded to provide some context:</p>



<p>&#8220;(It’s a Titanic quote, slores. Watch it. What a sin),&#8221; she wrote.</p>

<p></p>



<p>It&#8217;s somewhat surprising that Jionni returned to social media at all, given what a harsh response he received when Snooki posted the photo above back in May.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dang he exploded,&#8221; one commenter wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;HOLY SH*T Jionni picked up all the weight that Snooki lost,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;He needs to lose some fucking weight wth lol snooki is probably cheating on him constantly lol like she has been since the beginning lol,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Snooki still has far more fans than detractors.</p>



<p>&#8220;All you guys hating on her man are wack!!!! I look at snooki being even more of a loyal ass b!+ch holding her man down no matter what he looks like!!!&#8221; wrote one such supporter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Jionni will be able to rise above all this hate from random internet strangers!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Nicole &#8220;Snooki&#8221; Polizzi is one of the most iconic figures to ever emerge from the world of reality television.</p>



<p>Sure, the Kardashians and a handful of others might be more recognizable globally, but Kim married one of the world&#8217;s best-known rappers and branched out with the help of her famous family.</p>



<p>Snooki, on the other, hand is purely a product of the show that made her famous, and whatever success she&#8217;s found, she&#8217;s found on her own.</p>



<p>In fact, unlike Kim and the vast majority of reality stars, Snooki has managed to keep her family life largely under wraps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Snooki with her constant companion. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Sure, she posts the occasional update about her kids, but for how much she puts herself out there on <em>Jersey</em> <em>Shore</em> week after week, Snooks is surprisingly protective about certain aspects of her private life.</p>



<p>Take her marriage, for example.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/11/snooki-and-jionni-lavalle-married/">Snooki has been married to Jionni LaValle</a> for eight years, but unlike other <em>Shore</em> spouses, he never appears on camera.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Snooki and Jionni LaValle have been married since 2014. But Jionni has steered clear of the spotlight for most of that time. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Not only that, Jionni has only popped up on Snooks&#8217; Instagram page twice in 2022 &#8212; once on his birthday, and once on Father&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>Given how much she posts, it&#8217;s a little surprising that finding her husband in the archives is like playing Where&#8217;s Waldo: Guido Edition.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, Snooks&#8217; desire for this specific type of privacy has been a hot topic of discussion over the past week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Snooki and Jionni enjoy a date night. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>On Thursday&#8217;s episode of <em>Shore</em>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/jwoww-angelina-pivarnick-and-mike-sorrentino-are-both-shady-af/">the housemates criticized Angelina</a> for keeping certain aspects of her scandalous love life under wraps.</p>



<p>As the episode aired, fans took to Twitter to point out that Snooks is just as secretive about her own relationship.</p>



<p>Several fans called Snooki out for her alleged hypocrisy, including one critic who goes by the handle Miss Darcy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Where is ur husband?? Bcus we’re missing that WHOLE part of your life…&#8221; this person tweeted to Snooki, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2022/08/19/nicole-snooki-polizzi-reveals-why-husband-jionni-lavalle-doesnt-appear-on-jersey-shore-family-vacation/">as first reported by</a> The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup.</p>



<p>“Well Miss Darcy, he has severe anxiety and hates being in front of camera,” Nicole replied.</p>



<p>“He never liked it. He hardly lets me post pictures. It’s a mental health issue that I respect and choose not to push him to be on camera. But please, proceed to be nasty about it. It’s fine. Good day, Mam.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>What a cute family. Snooki poses here with her husband, Jionni LaValle, and their two kids. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now, that&#8217;s a perfectly valid reason for Jionni not to appear on the show &#8212; after all, the reality TV live is not for everyone &#8212; but it&#8217;s worth noting that it might not be the <em>only</em> reason.</p>



<p>Longtime viewers will likely remember that Jionni has appeared on Shore several times &#8212; and those cameos often did not go well.</p>



<p>One moment that seems to stand out in the memories of fans is Jionni&#8217;s disastrous trip to Italy to visit Snooks, who was filming in Florence at the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Snooki&#8217;s husband Jionni LaValle hasn&#8217;t appeared on Jersey Shore in years. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The couple fought the second he got off the plane, and Jionni spent about an hour in Italy before returning to the airport and flying home in a seething rage.</p>



<p>A distraught Snooki then confessed to VInny Guadagnino that his dong is far superior to Jionni&#8217;s, which might help to explain why Vin wasn&#8217;t invited to the wedding.</p>



<p>Anyway, Snooki&#8217;s defense didn&#8217;t do much to quell the allegations of hypocrisy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="991" height="798" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up.png" alt="Snooki Tears Up" class="wp-image-333864" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up.png 991w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-300x242.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-768x618.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-735x592.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-335x270.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-347x279.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-520x419.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-640x515.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/08/snooki-tears-up-960x773.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star Nicole &#8220;Snooki&#8221; Polizzi wipes away tears.

<p></p>



<p>“Oh, so it’s ok for Jionni to have a reason for privacy but not Angelina?” one person tweeted. </p>



<p>“All of you in Angelina’s business against her will &amp; constantly intruding about her sex life? She doesn’t ‘choose’ to share, you all bully and force it upon her. She’s finally learning how to handle you all.”</p>



<p>“I mean c’mon dude I’m sure Angelina has had anxiety since Season 1,” another chimed in. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Snooki and Jionni LaValle early in their relationship. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I’m sure Jionni don’t mind the paycheck that comes with you. You gotta pay a price.”</p>



<p>Snooki shut the conversation down with a tweet in which she defended the entire cast (with the presumable exception of Angelina):</p>



<p>“We all share our lives on this show for the past 10 years and we all took offense to that comment,” she wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Nicole &#8216;Snooki&#8217; Polizzi  and Jionni Lavalle shortly before they married. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Snooki&#8217;s argument might not be totally convincing, but we can certainly see why she&#8217;d be eager to end this line of inquiry.</p>



<p>After all, the time when she made fun of her future husband&#8217;s penis on national TV probably isn&#8217;t her favorite topic of conversation!</p>

<p>Snooki doesn&#8217;t seem like the kind of star who keeps many secrets from her fans.</p>



<p>During her years of <em>Jersey Shore</em> stardom, we&#8217;ve seen the Queen Meatball engage in all manner of drunken hijinks, and in confessional segments, she&#8217;s shared detailed accounts of everything from her sexual escapades to her most painful UTIs.</p>



<p>But for all her candor, there&#8217;s one element of Snooki&#8217;s personal life that she very assiduously keeps hidden from public view.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking, of course, about her marriage to Jionni LaValle.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s strange, right?</p>



<p>All of the other <em>Shore</em> spouses are regulars on the show, and Snooki is an open book about every other aspect of her existence.</p>



<p>But for whatever reason, she and LaValle keep their on-camera interactions to an absolute minumum.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>


<p>As longtime <em>Shore</em> viewers know, this wasn&#8217;t always the case.</p>



<p>In fact, in the early days of their relationship, Snooki may have shared a little too much information about Jionni, particularly with regard to the size of his manhood and his performance in bed.</p>



<p>At the time, Snooks was still enamored with Vinny Gudagnino (how things have changed! Those two barely interact now!), and she made those revelations while comparing her two love interests in a way that was quite unflattering to Jionni.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>


<p>Not many relationships could survive such a massive, public betrayal so early on, and that certainly wasn&#8217;t the only bump in the road for these two.</p>



<p>Remember when Jionni visited Snooki in Italy, and he was so pissed off by her hard-partying ways that he turned around and headed right back to the airport within hours?</p>



<p>Needless to say, a lot of <em>Shore</em> viewers &#8212; and cast members &#8212; assumed that the Snooki-Jionni relationship was not long for this world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But that turned out not to be the case.</p>



<p>“I have different priorities now,” Snooki said to the haters just before she <a href="/2014/11/snooki-and-jionni-lavalle-married/">married LaValle</a> in 2014 (in a ceremony that was not attended by Gudagnino or Mike Sorrentino, both of whom she was feuding with at the time).</p>



<p>“I don’t care what anybody else thinks. As long as I know I’m ready and he’s ready.”</p>



<p>So perhaps it&#8217;s not surprising that rumors of <a href="/2019/01/snooki-is-she-divorcing-her-husband-too/">Snooki and Jionni getting divorced</a> seem to crop up every few months.</p>



<p>These reports intensify each time Snooki leaves for another season of <em>Jersey Shore Family Vacation</em>.</p>



<p>But the couple hasn&#8217;t addressed the rumors since the first season of the spinoff series.</p>



<p>“Hey guys, I’m going to visit this subject one time and one time only,” Jionni shared on Instagram at the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“My wife is filming a scene packing up and leaving for her new show and I AM CHOOSING TO NOT be on TV because I simply DO NOT like it. Nicole and I are doing great and became even stronger together while raising our beautiful kids,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>LaValle went on to stress that he will <em>not</em> be making any future appearances on <em>Jersey Shore Family Vacation</em> &#8212; but he claims the decision has nothing to do with the state of his marriage.</p>



<p>“HOWEVER, you will not see me on her reality show,&#8221; he wrote.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>


<p>&#8220;Being a reality star was never something I wanted to be. … I own my own business and work hard at it, that’s what I do,&#8221; LaValle continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;My wife is a reality star and works hard at that, that’s what she does. We ARE not divorced.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, that was years ago, but it seems that Snooki and Jionni have adopted a policy of not discussing their marriage publicly, so perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that they considered that the last word on the matter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>In all likelihood, these two will continue to avoid discussing the state of their relationsip.</p>



<p>And since Jionni rarely appears on Snooks&#8217; Instagram page, we suppose that the reports of marital strife will continue to surface from time to time.</p>



<p>But for now at least, it looks as though the LaValles are content to let the rumor mill churn without feeling any need to set the record straight.</p>

<p>Sure, <a href="/2019/01/deena-nicole-cortese-gives-birth-see-the-first-baby-photos/">Deena just had her baby</a>, so things are probably cool there, and Sammi seems pretty content with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>The Situation seems very happy with his new wife, too, but <a href="/2018/10/the-situation-sentenced-to-8-months-in-prison/">he&#8217;s also headed off to prison soon</a>, so that&#8217;s not ideal.</p>
<p>As for Ron &#8230; do we even need to go into details about <a href="/slideshows/ronnie-ortiz-magro-hangs-with-family-flaunts-facial-wounds/">how horrifying his relationship is</a>?</p>
<p>Even <a href="/2018/12/roger-mathews-tells-kids-that-mommy-is-a-nutjob-in-stunning-911/">JWoww is in the middle of getting a divorce</a> from Roger Mathews, the guy she got with in the original run of the show.</p>
<p>And now, on top of all that heartache, there have been rumors that Snooki is ending things with her own husband, Jionni LaValle.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;But wait,&quot; you may be thinking, &quot;aren&#8217;t they having another kid together?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true &#8212; back in November, <a href="/2018/11/snooki-pregnant-with-baby-number-3/">she announced that she is pregnant</a> with their third child, a boy.</p>
<p>But just ask Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra &#8212; breakups can happen at any time, even during a pregnancy.</p>
<p>The rumors began swirling because of the lack of Jionni on Snooki&#8217;s Instagram.</p>
<p>He rarely shows up in her posts, and to many people, that&#8217;s a little suspicious.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Add in all those other rumors about their crumbling marriage, including that time he allegedly was <a href="/2015/09/snooki-pissed-about-jionni-lavalle-ashley-madison-account-source/">found with a secret Ashley Madison account</a>?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you get divorce talk started, folks.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry &#8212; Snooki did a new interview with Us Weekly and broke everything down.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s happening?!</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like if I don&#8217;t post pictures of Jionni or he doesn&#8217;t post pictures with me, it&#8217;s like we have marital issues and it&#8217;s not even the case,&quot; she <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nicole-snooki-polizzi-slams-jionni-lavalle-marital-issue-rumors/">complained</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The real issue, she said, is that &quot;Jionni just wants nothing to do with the spotlight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Babe, when you marry me, sometimes we got to take pictures together,&#8217;&quot; she continued. &quot;He&#8217;s like, &#8216;Nah, I&#8217;m good.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like when people don&#8217;t see us together in pictures, it&#8217;s like &#8216;OK, something must be wrong.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>But while she admitted that they&#8217;re &quot;not perfect,&quot; she said &quot;We&#8217;re not in a bad place. I love him so much.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s sweet, right?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The interview gets even sweeter when Snooki starts talking about how much Jionni&#8217;s been helping her out during her pregnancy, which she&#8217;s said has been much more difficult than her first two.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#8217;s helping me with the kids a lot, so me feeling this way and feeling disgusting and not in good moods, he usually takes the kids off my hands,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>&quot;He lets me rest all day on Sunday,&quot; and not only that, but &quot;He&#8217;s just really forgiving with my attitude, which is great, because usually if he&#8217;s not, we have a full-blown fight.&quot;</p>
<p>It sounds like even though these two have certainly gone through some rocky times, they&#8217;ve settled down and things are going really smoothly for them now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Rumors that<a href="/2017/12/snooki-and-jionni-lavalle-headed-for-divorce/"> Snooki and Jionni LaValle are headed for divorce</a> have been circulating non-stop several months now, because apparently a surprising number of people still care what the former stars of <em>Jersey Shore</em> are up to these days.</p>
<p>Of course, the vast majority of those people didn&#8217;t tune into the recent <a href="/2017/08/jersey-shore-reunion-was-it-as-lame-as-everyone-says/"><em>Jersey Shore</em> reunion special</a> which tanked in the ratings, but that&#8217;s a different story&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For a long time, Snooki and Jionni refused to address the divorce rumors <em>at all</em>, which only furthered suspicions that they were on the verge of calling it quits.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s hard to see why fans were convinced a separation announcement was in the offing.</p>
<p>Seemingly out of the blue, Snooki abruptly stopped posting photos of Jionni on her Instagram page.</p>
<p>According to Radar Online, LaValle was even <a href="https://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/nicole-polizzi-snooki-husband-marriage-bombshell-divorce-rumors-jersey-shore/">absent from the family Christmas card photo</a>.</p>
<p>Some Snooki aficionados proposed other theories, but everyone seemed in agreement that something was up with the LaValles.</p>
<p>And it looked as though whatever it was, the couple would do their best to keep it under wraps for the foreseeable future.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>These days, however, Snooki is more in the spotlight than at any other time since the peak of her <em>Shore</em> fame, which makes it all but impossible to keep a secret that big.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s universally understood that Snooks is who people are tuning in to see (if they tune in, that is), which means Mrs. Polizzi-LaValle is even more front-and-center than her cast mates.</p>
<p>Yes, folks may have lost interest in The Situation&#8217;s situation, but Snooki has maintained a pretty steady social media following over the years.</p>
<p>As in her <em>Shore</em> days, much of Snooki&#8217;s appeal stems from her candor, which may be why she&#8217;s decided to finally address the divorce rumors&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;by having Jionni clear things up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife is filming a scene packing up and leaving for her new show and I am choosing not to be on TV because I simply do not like it,&rdquo; Jionni wrote on Instagam this week.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That may sound worrisome, but it turns out the reason he doesn&#8217;t want any part of the scene is that he doesn&#8217;t want her to leave home in order to film the <em>Shore</em> specials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own my own business and work hard at it, that&rsquo;s what I do,&rdquo; LaValle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife is a reality star and works hard at that, that&rsquo;s what she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not respond to the persistent fan question about whether or not he and Snooki are living apart, but he did insist that they&#8217;re &quot;not divorced.&quot;</p>
<p>So it doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s all rainbows and sunshine in Snooki and Jionni&#8217;s world, but it <em>does</em> seem like they&#8217;re trying to work things out.</p>
<p>Probably not the best timing for her take off on a drunken road trip with a bunch of guys she&#8217;s previously hooked up with, but what are ya gonna do?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When<a href="/2014/11/snooki-and-jionni-lavalle-married/"> Snooki and Jionni LaValle got married</a>&nbsp;back in 2014, they truly defied the odds.</p>
<p>No, not because of that dumb &quot;don&#8217;t look for love on the Jersey Shore&quot; mantra that some of Snooks&#8217; roommates tried to make happen back in Season 1, but because of the circumstances under which their relationship began.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Usually, when romances start with one party telling the world that the other has a small penis while doing her best to cheat on him, it doesn&#8217;t bode well for the future.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that Jionni bailed after just a few hours when he attempted to visit Snooki during her time in Italy, and it&#8217;s pretty clear that the smart money would have been on these two never making it to the altar.</p>
<p>But to the utter shock of many, Snooki and Jionni tied the knot, and they&#8217;re currently raising two kids together.</p>
<p>Of course, for a while now, the LaValles relationship has looked more like an amicable co-parenting partnership than an actual marriage.</p>
<p>And now fans are starting to suspect that the lack of romance is putting a strain on the couple.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rumors of <a href="/2015/01/snooki-and-jionni-lavalle-living-separate-lives-headed-for-divor/">Snooki and Jionni living separate lives</a> have been circulating for years.</p>
<p>Only in the past few months, however, have the LaValles stopped trying to hide the growing distance between them.</p>
<p>Fans have noticed that Jionni is nowhere to be found on Snooks&#8217; social media page.</p>
<p>The couple is seldom seen together in public, and Jionni didn&#8217;t attend Deena Cortese&#8217;s wedding or any of the recent <em>Shore</em> reunion events with his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come your husband is never in anything ever?&rdquo; one fan recently asked on Snooks&#8217; Instagram page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more Jionni?&rdquo; echoed another.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Jionni never goes out with her and she seems to be going out a lot,<a href="https://radaronline.com/videos/nicole-polizzi-snooki-ditches-jionni-lavalle-marital-troubles-jersey-shore/">&rdquo; a source close to the couple</a> tells Radar Online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t say he has to take care of the kids because they live a few minutes away from his entire family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why fans are so curious.</p>
<p>According to Radar, Jionni and Snooki were spotted attending a comedy show together earlier this year, but they haven&#8217;t been photographed together with their kids since 2015!</p>
<p>Until today (seemingly in response to the latest round of rumors) the only pic Snooki had posted of Jionni in the past month was a throwback to their wedding day.</p>
<p>But who&#8217;s to say?</p>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;re one of those couples that can contentedly live separate lives and stay together for the kids.</p>
<p>Fans are a bit taken aback, of course, as Snooki&nbsp;&#8230; never struck as the unemotional type.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in November, FYI network (<em>Kocktails with Khloe, Married at First Sight</em>), announced <a href="/2015/11/snooki-gets-a-house-flipping-show-declared-interior-design-maven/">a new show</a> that would star Nicole &quot;Snooki&quot; Polizzi and her husband, Jionni LaValle.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Nicole &amp; Jionni&#8217;s Shore Flip</em>, the reality series follows the couple as they flip houses on the Jersey Shore, combining the antics of Snooki&#8217;s former summer home with the &quot;know-how&quot; of building a home.</p>
<p>Sounds dangerous.</p>
<p>Now, <em>Us </em>Magazine<a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/snooki-and-jionni-starring-in-new-reality-series-watch-the-trailer-w162249"> revealed a sneak peak</a> of the 8-episode program, which features Snooki&#8217;s&nbsp;cutesy antics (freaking out over loud noises, heavy focus on what she calls &quot;style&quot;) while Jionni&nbsp;quietly tries to finish the task at hand.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re a good team,&quot; Polizzi tells her husband in the trailer. &quot;You got the muscles &mdash; I got the ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>The show has been billed as such: The couple&#8217;s friends and family members will help them as they &quot;undertake their first business venture together flipping houses which between family and work is no walk on the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>Snooki also has a show on the&nbsp;go90 app with Jenni &quot;JWOWW&quot; Farley, <em>Moms With Attitude</em>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s basically Snooki and JWOWW&nbsp;as mothers, with the same &quot;zero f&#8211;ks given&quot; approach to life as on <em>Jersey Shore</em>.</p>
<p>Both shows feature&nbsp;Snooki and Jionni&#8217;s children, Lorenzo and Giovanna.</p>
