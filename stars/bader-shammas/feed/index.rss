										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>The announcement of a planned pregnancy is almost always a joyous occasion.</p>



<p>But news of the latest celebrity mom-to-be is sure to receive a very mixed reaction on social media!</p>



<p>Yes, Lindsay Lohan is pregnant with her first child, and while most commenters have offered their congratulations, some folks have been quick to express concern.</p>



<p>We guess that makes sense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan is pregnant with her first child! The actress made the announcement on Instagram Tuesday morning! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>After all, it wasn&#8217;t all that long ago that the mention of Lindsay becoming a mom would have prompted millions of concerned fans to place simultaneous, pre-emptive calls to CPS, warning them of what&#8217;s about to go down.</p>



<p>But that was then, and this is now.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/lindsay-lohan-married-to-some-guy-named-bader-shammas/">Lindsay is married to Bader Shammas</a>, and insiders say the couple enjoys a quiet, content life in Dubai where they make lots of healthy decisions and do little to no partying.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan just announced that she&#8217;s pregnant! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Lohan shared her joyous news with the world by posting the photo above on Instagram.</p>



<p>“We are blessed and excited!” the 36-year-old wrote in her caption.</p>



<p>Perhaps a more &#8220;basic&#8221; announcement than one might expect from a woman who&#8217;s spent her life in the spotlight, but it could be indicative, of the more quiet, humble life that LiLo is said to be living these days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan is expecting her first child! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“She is feeling great and she is thrilled,”<a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/03/14/lindsay-lohan-pregnant-expecting-first-baby-with-bader-shammas/"> a rep for Lindsay</a> tells Page Six.</p>



<p>Lindsay keeps a pretty low profile these days, but she&#8217;s been surprisingly candid about some developments in her life in recent months.</p>



<p>Lohan and Shammas tied the knot in July of 2022, and while the wedding took place in secret, the couple confirmed the news of their nuptials shortly thereafter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan and Bader Shammas will soon be parents! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In November, Lindsay and Bader made their red carpet debut while promoting her comeback film, a Netflix holiday romcom titled <em>Falling For Christmas</em>.</p>



<p>The movie turned out to be a kitchsy favorite with audiences, and just like that, Lindsay pulled off one of the most unexpected comebacks in Hollywood history.</p>



<p>Thus far, she hasn&#8217;t said much about her pregnancy, but she&#8217;s been very vocal about her love for Bader.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan and Bader Shammas are happily married. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I am the luckiest woman in the world. He found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time,” Lohan recently wrote on Instagram.</p>



<p>“I am stunned that this is my husband. My life and my everything. Every woman should feel like this everyday.”</p>



<p>Clearly, Lindsay is on top of the world these days.</p>

<p>Surely, some folks will cast doubt on her parenting capabilities.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;d like to add our voice to the chorus of millions offering their sincere congratulations to Lindsay and Bader!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>By the time she was old enough to vote, Lindsay Lohan was one of the biggest stars on the planet.</p>
<p>But we probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that her life hasn&#8217;t been following the traditional A-lister trajectory in recent years.</p>
<p>Between the<a href="/2019/06/lindsay-lohan-beach-house-closed-reality-show-canceled/"> failed reality shows</a>, the weird foreign business ventures (with the weird fake accents to match), and the slew of brushes with the law, it wasn&#8217;t long before LiLo went from headliner to punchline.</p>
<p>But insiders say Lohan is planning a comeback in 2022, and it seems she&#8217;s getting an early start by ending &#8217;21 on a high note!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, Lindsay took to Instagram Sunday morning to announce her engagement to fianc&eacute; Bader Shammas!</p>
<p>&quot;My love. My life. My family. My future,&quot; Lohan captioned a set of photo of herself and Shammas.</p>
<p>As you can see, Lindsay&#8217;s massive new rock is on full display in the pics.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Little is known about Shammas, other than the fact that&nbsp;works in finance as the Assistant Vice President at Credit Suisse in Dubai.</p>
<p>Lindsay has been living in Dubai for the past seven years, and she&#8217;s been dating Shammas since 2018.</p>
<p>&quot;Lohan&#8217;s relationship with Bader is going strong. She has been with him for about two years now,&quot; one insider tells UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;He is a legitimate guy. He&#8217;s not an actor, he&#8217;s not in the entertainment industry, he manages funds for high net worth people at Credit Suisse.&quot;</p>
<p>On Instagram, fans were overjoyed by the news, and Lohan&#8217;s post racked up over 800,000 likes in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>&quot;So happy to see you happy! Love you Lindsay,&quot; one follower commented, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-lindsay-lohan-engaged-mean-25564573">according to</a> UK tabloid the <em>Mirror</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Congratulations @bader.shammas you both have found your soul mates wish you both a life time of happiness health and love.&quot;</p>
<p>Lindsay has been pretty tight-lipped about her personal life in recent years, but insiders say that may soon change as the former child star seeks to reintroduce herself to the public.</p>
<p>Sadly, there&#8217;s no truth to the rumors that <a href="/2021/11/lindsay-lohan-is-she-really-starring-in-the-real-housewives-of-d/">Lindsay will be starring in <em>The Real Housewives of Dubai </em></a>(at least not for the show&#8217;s first season).</p>
<p>But the 35-year-old <em>Mean Girls</em> actress is planning to regain her place as one of Hollywood&#8217;s best-known actresses.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As recently as last year <a href="/2020/01/lindsay-lohan-im-moving-back-to-america-and-re-launching-my-care/">Lindsay was planning to move back to America</a>, but sources say her plans were complicated by Covid.</p>
<p>And now, her plans may have been further complicated by her love life.</p>
<p>We suppose it&#8217;s possible that Shammas would be willing to uproot his finance career and make a fresh start of it in the US, but it sounds like he&#8217;s the breadwinner in the relationship, so that might not be the smartest idea at the moment.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="620" height="420" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/lindsay-on-the-beach.jpg" alt="Lindsay on the Beach" class="wp-image-319209" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/lindsay-on-the-beach.jpg 620w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/lindsay-on-the-beach-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/lindsay-on-the-beach-335x227.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/lindsay-on-the-beach-347x235.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/lindsay-on-the-beach-520x352.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Whatever the case, it sounds like this couple is sufficiently well-heeled that Lindsay will be able to make trips to New York and LA for auditions when the need arises.</p>
<p>But hey, listen to us getting bogged down by details!</p>
<p>The important thing is that these two found love, and hope they&#8217;ll be happy together for many, many years to come.</p>
<p>LiLo&#8217;s been through a lot, and we can&#8217;t think of anyone in Hollywood who&#8217;s more deserving of an epic second act!</p>
