<p>Janelle Brown has shared a new message about her late son.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star did so on the most heartbreaking of occasions: The one-year anniversary of Garrison Brown taking his own life.</p>



<p>“I stay busy but in EVERY quiet moment you are first and foremost in my thoughts. It’s been a year baby,” Janelle wrote via Instagram on Wednesday, March 5&#8230;. alongside a photo of her late son smiling while holding one of his cats. </p>



<p>“We miss you so much.”</p>

<p>As most readers likely know by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">Garrison committed suicide in early 2024</a> via self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>



<p>In memory of her son, Janelle has often taken to social media on various occasions to pay Garrison tribute.</p>



<p>For example, his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-sends-message-to-late-son-on-first-christmas-without-him/">mom took some time late last year</a> to commemorate Garrison on Instagram Stories, sharing a set of photos of her family together taken on Christmas Eve in 2023.</p>



<p>“Miss you so much sweetheart,” Brown wrote alongside the lovely snapshot. “I am so beyond grateful we were all together last year and got pictures.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510011" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-960x540.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed.jpg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown is deep in thought on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In this latest case, the TLC personality encouraged her followers to consider making a donation to their local animal shelter, rescue or humane society, adding: </p>



<p>“This cause was close to Garrison’s heart &#8212; he adopted all three of his cats from shelters.”</p>



<p>Garrison was only 25 years old at the time of his passing.</p>



<p>Horribly, his younger brother, Gabriel Brown, found the young man on the morning of March 5 in his home in Flagstaff, Arizona after Janelle asked if one of her children could check on Garrison.</p>



<p>Janelle and ex-spouse Kody Brown broke their silence about their son’s death in a shared statement on their separate Instagram accounts, which read as follows:</p>



<p>“Kody and I are deeply saddened to announce the loss of our beautiful boy Robert Garrison Brown. He was a bright spot in the lives of all who knew him. His loss will leave such a big hole in our lives that it takes our breath away. We ask that you please respect our privacy and join us in honoring his memory.”</p>

<p>As it turns out, Garrison was struggling with alcohol dependence and Depression around this time last year.</p>



<p>Janelle, as mentioned previously, has made a point to honor Garrison on every major occasion since his death.</p>



<p>She previously opened up about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/">celebrating the holidays without Garrison</a> after she and her family got together for Thanksgiving.</p>



<p>After everyone packed their bags and left Janelle’s home, the Sister Wives cast member dedicated an Instagram post to Garrison… along with a throwback picture of him as a child.</p>



<p>“First of the ‘big’ holidays without you sweetheart. We all gathered in NC to celebrate together and kept your photo close by,” Janelle captioned her December 1 post.</p>



<p>“We laughed about your silly sense of humor and told so many stories honoring you. We ate, played games and enjoyed each other’s company. Everyone is returning home now and normal life resumes tomorrow. But I feel you close by.”</p>

<p>For his part, Kody has not said nearly as much about this tragedy.</p>



<p>However, he did talk to People Magazine prior to the premiere of the latest Sister Wives season, saying &#8220;it’s strange having your child pass&#8221; and adding:</p>



<p>“The wave of grief is different that any wave of grief I have ever had with a best friend passing, with a relative passing. It’s different. And it is different in the idea that it’s irreconcilable — the future that we missed with him.”</p>



<p>In looking back at the time he <em>did</em> spend with his son (the two were estranged when Garrison died) <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sister-wives-kody-brown-garrison-death/">Kody tried to remember</a> the part about him that he’ll miss the most, telling People:</p>



<p>“I want to go out to dinner again. I want to sit down. I want to have a beer. I want him to try and make me laugh because he was kind of that way. The only regret is just, gosh, I would just do that more often,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>“The only regret is that you didn’t do something. You didn’t take more time.”</p>

<p>As she&#8217;s made clear so many times in the past, Janelle Brown has no regrets.</p>



<p>Like, none at all, folks.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives cast member has been single for about three years now, having walked away from spiritual spouse Kody in early 2022.</p>



<p>Not just walked away, mind you. Janelle also <em>moved</em> away.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-514809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown has made the astute decision to walk away from Kody.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/janelle-brown-im-moving-on-in-2025/">Brown now lives near her daughter</a> in North Carolina.</p>



<p>In a new blog entry on behalf of her business, Taeda Farms, Janelle gushes over the difference in living on her own these days… versus how she was stuck for so long in a polygamous household and family.</p>



<p>“For the first time, I get to create a home that feels exactly like me,” Janelle wrote online this week, explaining that &#8220;when you’re part of a large family, decisions are never just about what you want.”</p>



<p>Truth be told, decisions for the Browns were <em>always</em> about what Kody wanted.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1014" height="570" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519598" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1.jpg 1014w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown on Season 18 of Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Everything had to go through some kind of committee decision, and larger family gatherings were always factored in,” Janelle went on via this blog. </p>



<p>“There were other voices to consider, other needs to meet, and resources to share. Kody had his opinions, of course, and beyond that, everything had to fit within the broader dynamic of the family. Compromise was just part of the deal.”</p>



<p>Janelle went on to compare her previous experiences to her ongoing one, telling fans “it’s completely different” because she gets to make all the choices for her new home and no longer has to “justify” her choices to fit someone else’s vision.</p>



<p>Yes, we&#8217;re looking at you again, Kody.</p>

<p>Added Janelle:</p>



<p>“I can build a space that reflects exactly what I want, how I live, and what makes me feel at home. And let me tell you &#8212; that’s both exhilarating and a little overwhelming.”</p>



<p>Brown, of course, has been living with every parent&#8217;s worst nightmare for several months now after son Garrison <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/">took his own life in March 2024</a>.</p>



<p>This tragedy helped propel Janelle to make her move, as she is now closer to one of her children on the East Coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the first time, I get to figure it out without worrying about anyone else’s opinion,” Janelle also told followers a few days ago. </p>



<p>“And I can’t wait to see this home take shape &#8212; brick by brick, choice by choice, completely mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amen, Janelle. You deserve it.</p>

<p>Remember a little while ago? When Christine Brown gave good friend Janelle Brown some advice? Telling her to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/christine-brown-to-janelle-go-f-k-someone-new-already/">go sleep with someone else</a> in order to be considered officially divorced from ex-spouse Kody?</p>



<p>Welp.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound as if Janelle has any plans on listening to her pal.</p>



<p>Not now. And maybe not ever.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1014" height="570" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519598" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1.jpg 1014w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/janelle-brown-sister-wives-season-18-1014x570-1-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown on Season 18 of Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>During an appearance on Kate and Oliver Hudson&#8217;s Sibling Revelry podcast on Febryary 17, the Sister Wives cast member opened up about her life after her split from Kody, addressing both her past and her apparent future.</p>



<p>&#8220;My marriage is over. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna do,&#8221; Brown said on air, sounding more vulnerable than usual. </p>



<p>This 55-year old left Kody just over two years ago, following in the footsteps of Christine and preceding Meri Brown making the same decision a short time later.</p>



<p>Janelle, however, has remained the most silent of these three women since all went off on their own, with the exception of some comments <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/janelle-brown-to-kody-you-will-not-screw-me-over-im-fighting-for-whats-mine/">regarding her personal finances</a>.</p>

<p>On the aforementioned podcast, though, Janelle delved more than usual into her personal life.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really interested in getting married again or even really dating at this stage,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;So I&#8217;m not even thinking about, like, &#8216;Oh, what do I need to do?&#8217; Because I&#8217;m just like, I am over [it].&#8221;</p>



<p>Over all of it, evidently. Over just, like, men in general.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love my single life,&#8221; Brown added on the episode.</p>

<p>Janelle, as readers likely know, faced the ultimate crisis in March 2024.</p>



<p>Her son, Garrison, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">took his own life</a> via self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>



<p>“Kody and I are deeply saddened to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/garrison-brown-cause-of-death-sister-wives/">announce the loss of our beautiful boy</a> Robert Garrison Brown,&#8221; Janelle announced at the time.</p>



<p>“He was a bright spot in the lives of all who knew him. His loss will leave such a big hole in our lives that it takes our breath away. We ask that you please respect our privacy and join us in honoring his memory.”</p>

<p>While she has no romantic endeavors in the works and while she&#8217;s clearly secure and confident on her own these days, Janelle hasn&#8217;t closed the door entirely. </p>



<p>&#8220;If something presents itself in the future, then I&#8217;ll consider what I need to do,&#8221; she noted on air.</p>



<p>In December 2022, Janelle confirmed that she and Kody had separated after a 29-year spiritual marriage. </p>



<p>The news came after her sister wife Christine announced <em>her</em> decision to leave Kody and their plural marriage in November 2021. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, as cited above, Kody&#8217;s <em>first</em> wife, Meri, shortly followed with her own announcement in January 2023.</p>

<p>Only Robyn Brown remains in Kody&#8217;s no-longer-polygamous household.</p>



<p>Despite her decision to go her own way, Janelle told People Magazine in January 2024 that she doesn&#8217;t consider herself &#8220;divorced.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because we never were legally married, I can&#8217;t really say I&#8217;m divorced,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I just say &#8216;I&#8217;m no longer with&#8217; [him] when I explain it to outside people, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m no longer with my partner.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just consider myself single, I don&#8217;t consider myself divorced or separated or whatever. I just think I&#8217;m single.&#8221;</p>

<p>NSFW ALERT! NSFW ALERT! </p>



<p>On the February 2 episode of Sister Wives, Janelle Brown embarked on a cross-country road trip with Christine Brown and her husband, David Woolley. </p>



<p>The close pals started by reflecting on the challenging journey fellow ex-sister wife <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meri-brown/">Meri Brown</a> has been on in regard to the group&#8217;s former spouse, Kody, making it clear neither Janelle or Christine harbored any ill will toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Meri well. I really do hope, like, I really want all the good things for her because I feel like she&#8217;s been through the wringer,&#8221; said Janelle early on, prompting Christine to agree as follows: </p>



<p>&#8220;I hope she can get in a loving relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle went on to emphasize how Meri had obtained a spiritual release from her marriage through the family’s former church. </p>



<p>Via confessional, Janelle said she might be interesting in taking the same step, although she really had no clue how to go about doing this.</p>

<p>For his part, Kody made it sound as if he did still have certain feelings for Janelle.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Meri, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Christine,&#8221; the father of 18 told the camera. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some kind of karmic connection that Janelle and I are obligated to still.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the (WEIRD!) rules of the family&#8217;s church, a wife isn’t considered to be spiritually separated from her husband until she has sex with someone else. </p>



<p>On their road trip, Janelle trashed this whole concept as &#8220;bulls&#8211;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>But Christine encouraged her friend to basically embrace it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go have sex with somebody, then that marriage is over. You can move on!&#8221; Christine laughed to the camera in a confessional of her own.</p>



<p>Meri, however, agreed that this entire theme and proposal was BS.</p>



<p>&#8220;Until I have sex with somebody, that means I&#8217;m still attached to Kody? I don&#8217;t think it means that,&#8221; she said remarked in a separate confessional. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think it really is more for if you&#8217;re going to go outside of your marriage and have sexual relations, then now you are that marriage is nullified.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>When it comes to how ex-husband Kody has handled finances in recent years, Janelle Brown would like to give her two cents.</p>



<p>Almost more than ever before, this was a topic Janelle broached on the January 26 episode of Sister Wives, telling the camera of how things worked in the early years of her plural marriage:</p>



<p><br>&#8220;We weighed in on what bills should be paid, how we were going to pay, who got priority.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="378" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/janelle-brown.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517685" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/janelle-brown.jpg 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/janelle-brown-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown is on a Facetime call in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In other words? It was a team effort,</p>



<p>Janelle, Christine, Meri and Robyn all contributed &#8212; in some sense, at least &#8212; to the family&#8217;s monetary situation.</p>



<p>Over the last few years, of course, the first three women listed above have <em>ALL</em> walked away from Kody.</p>



<p>Even before that, however, Brown said on this latest installment that &#8220;Kody would just take out funds and I don&#8217;t know what for. And the money was just being spent and lots of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not exactly news to learn that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/are-robyn-and-kody-brown-facing-money-troubles-will-they-sell-coyote-pass/">Kody is bad with money</a>.</p>



<p>But Janelle makes it sound here as if he was almost stealing from his spouses.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-514809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown has made the astute decision to walk away from Kody.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you might expect, meanwhile, Kody sees things differently. He said via confessional on this episode that he didn&#8217;t owe Janelle or anyone else any kind of transparency.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was a father to 18 and a husband to more than just Janelle,&#8221; he explained during the episode. &#8220;So we had a lot of places that money needed to go that weren&#8217;t always Janelle&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>



<p>The narcissist even passed the blame to his ex, saying on air:</p>



<p>&#8220;Janelle was doing the bookkeeping so some of the bills to be paid by all of us, were supposed to be paid by her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janelle believes that Kody pampered Robyn far more than any other sister wife (&#8220;I used to always be surprised at how nice her backyard was. It was completely finished. And there was always, like, stuff at her house. And I was like, &#8216;Wow. Huh,'&#8221; she said on Sunday night)&#8230; while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meri-brown/">Meri Brown</a> also has had some questions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Those family funds that I helped with went to kids’ college, went to property,&#8221; she recounted in a talk with pal Jenn Sullivan on the show&#8217;s January 19 episode. &#8220;It went to everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Except, apparently, to cover the cost of classes at Utah&#8217;s Westminster College &#8212; where Meri&#8217;s only child, Leon Brown, attended school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know how much of the family fund actually paid for other kids’ school or cars,&#8221; Meri acknowledged of the other 17 kids she shared with Kody and her fellow sister wives.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I know that my kiddo’s school was not taken care of from the family fund.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janelle and Meri Brown are putting their feet down.</p>



<p><em><strong>HARD</strong></em>.</p>



<p>In a sneak peek at this Sunday&#8217;s brand new episode of Sister Wives, the former co-spouses team up in order to try and bring their ex-husband down.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="378" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/janelle-brown.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517685" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/janelle-brown.jpg 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/janelle-brown-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown is on a Facetime call in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Meri and I, we&#8217;re not friends, we don’t hang out, but there is now communication about what we need to do as far as the property,” Janelle tells the camera in this preview for installment, which was released by TLC and which focuses on Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>The parcel of land was purchased by Kody Brown and his then-sister wives in 2018 &#8230; but they never started any sort of construction on the property.</p>



<p>And now Kody has been dumped by Janelle, Meri and Christine and the women are afraid he&#8217;ll screw them out of their share of any eventual sale.</p>



<p>Janelle, meanwhile, is later shown in this clip chatting with Meri over video and declaring that she is NOT going to let Kody to swindle her out of what she feels is rightfully hers in regard to Coyote Pass.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="995" height="756" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg" alt="Kody Brown versus Meri Brown" class="wp-image-507193" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg 995w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-768x584.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-960x729.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown and Meri Brown on Sister Wives Season 19.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I think it’s time for someone to be pushing my interest,” Janelle tells Meri. “I have to fight for what’s mine!”</p>



<p>Over the course of Sister Wives Season 19, Coyote Pass has been a major topic of discussion&#8230; with Kody even admitting that would absolutely do Janelle dirty in regard to the property &#8212; if it weren’t for Robyn’s objections.</p>



<p>Meri recently said that she was told by Kody that she wasn’t “entitled” to an equal share of the property because she only has one child.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s really such a sweetheart, isn&#8217;t he?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="516" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514076" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is no longer in any polygamous relationships.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the footage from this upcoming episode, Meri acknowledges that she allowed Kody treat her unfairly for many years of their marriage, which they officially <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">terminated in January 2023</a>. </p>



<p>However, she says she’s no longer going to allow Kody to make the decisions for her.</p>



<p>“I don’t think [Kody] gets to decide!” an angry Meri tells Janelle before trashing a principle from their polygamous lifestyle. “Sorry [Kody], you are not the ‘head’ of my family!” </p>

<p>On last week’s episode, Kody made it clear that he believed that it would be up to <em>him</em> as to how the money from the land’s sale would be divided.</p>



<p>“I think [my exes] are worried about whether I’m going to be fair or not,” Kody said with a laugh.</p>

<p>For Janelle Brown, it&#8217;s out with the old and in with the new&#8230; year.</p>



<p>In a recent Instagram post, the Sister Wives veteran uploaded a smiling, fresh-faced selfie as she delved into what she&#8217;s hoping for 2025.</p>



<p>And beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;This year, I’m choosing detox as my word for 2025—I’ve been drawn to this word so strongly the past few weeks. For me it’s a commitment to clear out what no longer serves me, in every sense,&#8221; wrote the 55-year old, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s about making space for greater peace and clarity by detoxing my life EMOTIONALLY, PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, and SPIRITUALLY.&#8221;</p>



<p>As readers likely know at this point, Janelle, from Kody Brown in 2022 after nearly three decades as spiritual husband and wife.</p>



<p>Previously, Christine Brown did the same; and subsequently, Meri Brown has done the same.</p>



<p>Of all these women, though, Janelle has remained most private about her decision to end her polygamous arrangement; tragically, she&#8217;s mostly spoken out of late in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">suicide of son Garrison</a>.</p>

<p>Janelle, in this case, detailed in the lengthy caption how she&#8217;s planning to &#8220;detox&#8221; her life, beginning with clean eating.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am actively embracing the changes that are coming with age and hormone shifts with grace and care,&#8221; the TLC personality said.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also a &#8220;mental detox,&#8221; Janelle wrote she hopes to accomplish, elaborating as follows:</p>



<p><em>It’s time to cut down on the noise. I want to be intentional with my screen time, embrace more journaling and writing, lean into time blocking, planning and building routines. Less noise, more quiet.</em></p>

<p>As for her &#8220;emotional detox?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>I’m also prioritizing meaningful connections and seeking out community in all areas of my life. I will work to set healthier boundaries and release relationships that drain me.</em></p>



<p>And her &#8220;environmental detox?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>A cluttered space clutters my mind, so I’m making it a priority to simplify and create a more peaceful environment. This will be especially important as I step into 2025 planning and building a new home</em>.</p>



<p>And her &#8220;spiritual detox?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Spending more time in nature, reflecting, and nurturing my relationship with God.</em></p>

<p>Janelle moved to North Carolina last year to be closer to her loved ones.</p>



<p>&#8220;Detoxing isn’t about deprivation—it’s about freedom,&#8221; she concluded in this post. </p>



<p>&#8220;Freedom from things that weigh me down, so I can make room for the things that truly matter. I’m excited for 2025!&#8221;</p>



<p>The following year, of course, will include <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-to-kody-dude-your-family-hates-you/">basically no interaction with Kody</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, the reality star&#8217;s main focus these days has been on the loss of her child.</p>



<p>In September, she told People Magazine the family had &#8220;no idea&#8221; how much Garrison was struggling as he &#8220;didn&#8217;t ever express any kind of extreme sad feelings.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we could have done different&#8230; we were having real conversations with him,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/janelle-brown-i-was-stunned-by-my-sons-suicide/">Janelle told this publication back then</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;We were offering resources, we were always talking to him, we were loving him. All the things were there.</p>



<p>&#8220;It really just was something he could not… like the demon he couldn&#8217;t get on top of the battle. He couldn&#8217;t seem to get over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janelle Brown just spent her first Christmas without son Garrison.</p>



<p>But he was very much in her thoughts.</p>



<p>As Sister Wives fans know all too well at this point, the 25-year-old <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">took his own life back</a> in March via a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>

<p>In memory of Garrison, his mom took some time this week to commemorate her late son on Instagram Stories, sharing a set of photos of her family together taken on Christmas Eve in 2023.</p>



<p>“Miss you so much sweetheart,” Brown wrote alongside the memorable snapshot. “I am so beyond grateful we were all together last year and got pictures.”</p>



<p>The first photo Janelle uploaded was a family picture of herself beside all six of her children &#8212; who she shares with ex Kody Brown &#8212; their spouses and her grandchildren. </p>



<p>A second photo featured Garrison pulled in his mother for a kiss on her cheek.</p>

<p>Garrison was found dead in his home in Arizona on March 5, the Flagstaff Police Department reported at the time.</p>



<p>According to the official report, officers responded to a report of a death inside a home and confirmed that Garrison&#8217;s brother Gabriel had &#8220;discovered Mr. Brown deceased.&#8221; </p>



<p>The manner of death was later deemed a &#8220;suicide.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just so, so sad all around.</p>

<p>Janelle has made a point to honor Garrison on every major occasion since his death.</p>



<p>For example, the TLC personality previously opened up about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/">celebrating the holidays without Garrison</a> after she and her family got together for Thanksgiving. </p>



<p>After everyone packed their bags and left Janelle’s home, the Sister Wives cast member dedicated an Instagram post to Garrison&#8230; along with a throwback picture of him as a child.</p>



<p>“First of the ‘big’ holidays without you sweetheart. We all gathered in NC to celebrate together and kept your photo close by,” Janelle captioned her December 1 post. </p>



<p>“We laughed about your silly sense of humor and told so many stories honoring you. We ate, played games and enjoyed each other’s company. Everyone is returning home now and normal life resumes tomorrow. But I feel you close by.”</p>

<p><em>He was a bright spot in the lives of all who knew him. His loss will leave such a big hole in our lives that it takes our breath away. </em></p>



<p><em>We ask that you please respect our privacy and join us in honoring his memory.</em></p>

<p>Janelle Brown opened up this week about her wedding to Kody Brown.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s just say it doesn&#8217;t sound as if it was the most romantic gathering of all-time.</p>



<p>The walk down memory lane was shown on air after Janelle arrived in Utah with daughter Maddie Brush to help Christine Brown pick out a wedding dress for her wedding to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a>. </p>



<p>From there, Janelle couldn&#8217;t help but reflect on her own nuptials back in the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I actually didn&#8217;t have a wedding dress,&#8221; Janelle said in a confessional. &#8220;When Kody and I got married, my family was very upset with my decision to join the faith, so most of my family was not talking to me or associating with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown went on to say she wore a green gown for the occasion.</p>



<p>Also?</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom was at the wedding because she came to save me from the polygamist and ended up marrying Kody&#8217;s dad three months before we got married,&#8221; Janelle explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;So my mom was obviously okay with it, but the rest of my family was really not okay with it. So they didn&#8217;t, they didn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/janelle-not-in-love-kody-embed-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-510175" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/janelle-not-in-love-kody-embed-1.webp 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/janelle-not-in-love-kody-embed-1-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown is doing all she can to recover from her son&#8217;s suicide.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. The world of polygamy can be an&#8230; interesting one.</p>



<p>Janelle was spiritually married to Kody from 1993 to 2022; they were never any legal vows exchange. </p>



<p>Before this, Janelle was married to Adam Barber &#8212; the brother of Kody&#8217;s first wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meri-brown/">Meri Brown</a> &#8212; from 1988 to 1990.</p>



<p>Like we just said: The world of polygamy can be an&#8230; interesting one.</p>

<p>Thinking about her future, about two years after she walked away from Kody, Janelle told the camera:</p>



<p>&#8220;If I get married again, I&#8217;m probably not going to have a dress. I&#8217;m not going to do the big white dress. I mean, I&#8217;m probably honestly going to just get married on a mountain in my jeans somewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>Christine, Janelle and Meri have all left Kody over the last few years.</p>



<p>The latter stuck around the longest and acknowledged on this same episode that she had a &#8220;good time with him&#8230; now we&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="516" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514076" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is no longer in any polygamous relationships.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a confessional of her own, Meri &#8212; who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">announced her separation from Kody</a> in January 2023 and later obtained an official marriage termination through her church &#8212; spoke positively about her next chapter and where she goes from here.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel so much like I&#8217;m moving forward,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Eventually, I&#8217;m going to find a guy and then who knows what after that, who knows what will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the December 1 episode of <em>Sister Wives</em>, the mother of six threw a graduation party for her and Kody’s youngest daughter, Savanah Brown &#8230; and she chose NOT to invite her self-centered former spouse.</p>



<p>“Kody is alienated from 90 to 95 percent of his children,” said Janelle in a confessional.</p>



<p>The veteran reality star shares Logan Brown, 30, Madison Brush, 29, Hunter Brown, 27, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/">the late Garrison Brown</a>, Gabriel Brown, 23, and Savanah, 19, with her ex &#8212; with whom she is no longer close.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is not really wanted at events. He is not coming regardless of who he brings or doesn’t bring with him,&#8221; Janelle added plainly.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c.webp" alt="Kody Brown here with Janelle Brown" class="wp-image-487686" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c-735x490.webp 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c-335x223.webp 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c-347x231.webp 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c-520x347.webp 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/sister-wives-092223-1-10cf0201d70b4819b3b60f39e9890a8c-640x427.webp 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown and Janelle Brown share the screen here. They no longer share a marriage.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This final sentence was a clear reference to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/robyn-brown/">Robyn Brown</a>, the only wife who has chosen to stick by Kody&#8217;s side over the past few years.</p>



<p>“Kody has this idea that somehow if he leaves Robyn home, he’s going to be able to come to these family gatherings,” Janelle also said on air. “And that’s so far from the truth.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been evident for quite a while that Janelle, Meri and Christine Brown all have issues with Robyn; they all believe she has been Kody&#8217;s favorite for a very long time now.</p>



<p>Hence why Kody is under the impression that he isn&#8217;t invited to family gatherings because it would mean his ex-sister wives must spend time with his current <em>legal</em> wife.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="516" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514076" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is no longer in any polygamous relationships.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I’d like to be a part of Savanah’s life, but it’s like they’re in this collusion that seems to hate Robyn, and I don’t know why other than, well, they’re jealous,” Kody said to the camera on Sunday night. </p>



<p>“I’ve got this whole other side of the family that have decided that they’re still a family and we’re out. Now, they’ll let me in that club as long as I leave Robyn behind. I can’t do that.”</p>



<p>Janelle, of course, swears this isn&#8217;t the case.</p>



<p>For the record, too, this episode was filmed quite a long time ago &#8230; and Kody <em>did</em> attend Savanah’s actual graduation in the end, which took place in May 2023.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s no secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-blasts-kody-hes-a-deadbeat-dad/">Kody isn&#8217;t close with most of his children</a>.</p>



<p>On the November 3 episode of <em>Sister Wives</em>, Janelle spoke candidly to Kody about the situation.</p>



<p>“The kids are all feeling very estranged from you,” she explained to him. “There’s a lot of nuances, and I can’t be in the middle.”</p>



<p><strong>Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10/9c on TLC.</strong></p>
