<p>Kelly Clarkson welcomed 50 Cent to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/kelly-clarkson-responds-to-report-of-toxic-work-environment-this-is-unacceptable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her daytime talk show</a> earlier this week.</p>



<p>And viewers were convinced that they saw some serious sparks flying between the host and her guest!</p>



<p>Yes, 50&#8217;s appearance on Kelly&#8217;s show quickly became the talk of TikTok.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1145551694-1024x683.jpg" alt='Kelly Clarkson attends STX Films World Premiere of "UglyDolls" at Regal Cinemas L.A.

<p>And it&#8217;s been a while since folks on social media platform so enthusiastically shipped a couple of random celebs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-are-convinced-that-kelly-clarkson-is-crushing-on-50-cent">Fans Are Convinced That Kelly Clarkson Is &#8216;Crushing On&#8217; 50 Cent</h2>



<p>In fact, viewers stopped just short of designing wedding invitations for these two!</p>



<p>“Is it just me or are they flirting?” one TikToker asked, according to <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/fans-think-kelly-clarkson-was-flirting-with-50-cent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-1024x693.jpg" alt="Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson attends WE TV's &quot;Hip Hop Homicides&quot; New York Premiere at Crosby Street Hotel on November 10, 2022 in New York City." class="wp-image-515371" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-768x519.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-2048x1385.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-960x649.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-1080x730.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1440633518-1200x812.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Curtis &#8220;50 Cent&#8221; Jackson attends WE TV&#8217;s &#8220;Hip Hop Homicides&#8221; New York Premiere at Crosby Street Hotel on November 10, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Wait aren’t they both single? This is cute,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>“She’s crushing SO HARD!!!!” a third chimed in.</p>



<p>Others theorized that Kelly was displaying subtle signs of attraction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>“She is SO charmed by him. My southern accent comes out JUST like that when I’m enthralled with someone,” one user commented.</p>



<p>“I just need them to date. Because like, it’s there. Clearly, all of it,” another opined.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-kelly-and-50-actually-hook-up">Will Kelly and 50 Actually Hook Up?</h2>



<p>So is it possible that Ms. Clarkson and Mr. Cent will actually become an item?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="716" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-1024x716.jpg" alt="Kelly Clarkson visits SiriusXM at SiriusXM Studios on June 21, 2023 in New York City." class="wp-image-515373" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-1024x716.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-768x537.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-2048x1431.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-960x671.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-1080x755.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1500398818-1-1200x839.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kelly Clarkson visits SiriusXM at SiriusXM Studios on June 21, 2023 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, despite their obvious chemistry in front of the cameras, it seems unlikely &#8212; at least for now.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kelly-clarkson-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly recently went through a nasty divorce</a>, so she&#8217;s probably not looking to settle down again anytime soon.</p>



<p>As for 50, he&#8217;s never been married, and he recently opened up about going celibate during an interview with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-stephen-colbert-late-show-apology-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Colbert</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-1024x683.jpg" alt='50 Cent attends the "Power Book III: Raising Kanan" New York Premiere at Hammerstein Ballroom on July 15, 2021 in New York City.' class="wp-image-515369" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1328943514-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">50 Cent attends the &#8220;Power Book III: Raising Kanan&#8221; New York Premiere at Hammerstein Ballroom on July 15, 2021 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Listen, when you calm down you can focus. I’ve been good to me,&#8221; he told Colbert. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am safe. I’m not a happy hostage. I’m here. I’m free. I made some mistakes, just not that one.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, it sounds like 50 isn&#8217;t looking for anything serious at the moment. Or ever.</p>

<p>So maybe there&#8217;s not much of a future for Kelly and 50. But at least fans got to enjoy one of the most fun, flirty celebrity interviews in recent memory.</p>



<p>Hey, it&#8217;s been a tough year for pretty much everyone.</p>



<p>So maybe we should all just set aside important matters and focus on shipping celebrities for the next couple of weeks! There are worse ways to ride out 2024!</p>

<p>The 50 Cent vs Taco Bell feud must have been one of the weirdest ever.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a spat that couldn&#8217;t have happened at any other time in history.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/50-cent-responds-to-king-combs-diss-track-im-afraid-for-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 Cent has been the target of diss tracks</a> in the past. It goes with the territory of his work. But locking horns with one of America&#8217;s most beloved fast food institutions was a little odd.</p>



<p>It all started with a joke. What followed was a $4 million lawsuit.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="50 Cent in June of 2024." class="wp-image-502621" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_50cent_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Curtis &#8220;50 Cent&#8221; Jackson, listens as lawyer Ben Crump speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol as they meet with lawmakers about Black entrepreneurship on June 5, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-50-cent-feud-with-taco-bell">Why did 50 Cent feud with Taco Bell?</h2>



<p>It all begins in 2008. We might not refer to that fateful year as a &#8220;happier, simpler time,&#8221; but it was a considerably less stressful election year than any that have followed.</p>



<p>In May of that year, Taco Bell released its new value menu. This is when anyone reading this more than a decade and a half later should begin to weep.</p>



<p>Prices for individual items on Taco Bell&#8217;s value menu were 79 cents, 89 cents, and 99 cents. In 2024, those are closer to the price of a single packet of Taco Bell&#8217;s Avocado Verde sauce (which, to be fair, is delicious) than to an actual food item.</p>

<p>You may have already guessed where this is going.</p>



<p>To promote their new value menu, Taco Bell&#8217;s campaign included a (joking) suggestion that 50 Cent (whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III) change his name.</p>



<p>Rather than 50 Cent, the iconic fast food franchise suggested, he might change his name to 79 Cent, to 89 Cent, or even to 99 Cent.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-50-cent-was-not-amenable-to-the-suggestion">50 Cent was not amenable to the suggestion</h2>



<p>To be fair, it doesn&#8217;t sound like 50 Cent&#8217;s issue was with a joke about renaming him.</p>



<p>Rather, he accused Taco Bell of using his name &#8212; for an advertising campaign &#8212; without his permission. In 2008, he was still considered a &#8220;big name&#8221; in popular culture.</p>



<p>And that is why he filed a $4 million lawsuit against Taco Bell. At that time, that would have been enough for more than 4 million value menu items!</p>

<p>Social media already existed in 2008. Additionally, forums and other internet communities (back when Google functioned well) gave people places to talk.</p>



<p>According to 50 Cent&#8217;s lawsuit at the time, according to <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/25/50.cent.sues.taco.bell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some fans assumed</a> that 50 Cent had endorsed Taco Bell&#8217;s products. Allegedly, various bloggers were putting him on blast for &#8220;selling out&#8221; &#8212; again, per his legal filing.</p>



<p>In other words, he accused Taco Bell of misusing his name and trademark without his permission &#8212; and of causing harm to his public image and brand. While many people would feel nothing short of delight to feature in a Taco Bell ad &#8230; they&#8217;d want to sign off on it and get paid, right?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-won-the-50-cent-vs-taco-bell-lawsuit">Who won the 50 Cent vs Taco Bell lawsuit?</h2>



<p>By 2009, it became widely reported that 50 Cent <a href="https://nypost.com/2009/11/24/taco-you-very-much-50-cent-wins-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had won</a> the Taco Bell lawsuit. However, his attorney told the public that neither party would be discussing the details of the settlement (which is standard).</p>



<p>It is natural for many people to instinctively side with Taco Bell over <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/50-cent-denies-rape-allegation-from-ex-girlfriend-daphne-joy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone like 50 Cent</a>. But we <em>hope </em>that the settlement satisfied all parties.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the rampant <em>greedflation </em>causing prices to skyrocket in recent years, there&#8217;s one upside to ordering Taco Bell more than 15 years after 2008: you can easily have it delivered.</p>

<p>50 Cent has responded to a challenge from Diddy&#8217;s embattled son King Combs.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/what-is-p-diddy-being-accused-of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is under investigation</a> for multiple sexual assault allegations.</p>



<p>50, a longtime rival of Diddy&#8217;s, has made no secret of the fact that he believes this particular downfall is long overdue.</p>

And that&#8217;s likely because his lawyers have advised him not to remain silent for the time being.</p>



<p>But King has decided to speak up on his dad&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/05/13/diddy-son-christian-king-combs-raids-50-cent-diss-akademiks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, King has recorded a diss track about 50. And the track contains some very scathing remarks about the hip hop legend.</p>



<p>The track, titled &#8220;Pick a Side,&#8221; was streamed by DJ Akademiks ahead of its release. And if King was hoping for some controversy, it seems that he got what he wanted.</p>



<p>&#8220;When all they had was 50 Cent who put this city on the map? Stop lyin&#8217;,&#8221; King raps at one point in the song.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pops been hated on by many men and that&#8217;s fine/ They gon&#8217; try to stop these M&#8217;s and they gon&#8217; die tryin&#8217;,&#8221; he continued, referencing 50&#8217;s song &#8220;Many Men&#8221; and his iconic album, <em>Get Rich or Die Trying</em>.</p>

<p>Never one to shy away from a fight, 50 promptly took to social media to share his thoughts on his latest challenger.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel so threatened by the things Christian is saying on his record,&#8221; 50 sarcastically tweeted, using King&#8217;s real name.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m afraid for my life, please don’t hurt me guys. I never mentioned or posted anything about puffy’s kids because KEEFE D said he killed 2Pac.&#8221;</p>



<p>That last part is a reference to Duane “Keefe D” Davis. Davis was arrested in September for his alleged involvement in the murder of Tupac Shakur.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-50-cent-gets-personal-in-scathing-tweets">50 Cent Gets Personal In Scathing Tweets</h2>



<p>From there, 50 crudely referenced the sexual assault allegations against 50:</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don’t understand why they want to drug women, if she can’t remember how good it was the next morning how do you connect?&#8221;</p>



<p>At one point, King referenced the recent federal raids of Diddy&#8217;s property, rapping:</p>



<p>&#8220;Knock these doors down like them feddy boys running both our cribs / Too bad they ain&#8217;t know we bought the one next door cause that&#8217;s the one they missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now why would you say some shit like this when you know the FEDS are investigating. IS YOU STUPID OR IS YOU DUMB? LOL,&#8221; 50 tweeted, seemingly in response to those lines.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear if 50 intends to reply with a diss track of his own.</p>



<p>But one thing is certain &#8212; the feud between 50 Cent and King Combs is definitely on!</p>

<p>50 Cent is speaking out today amid claims that he raped ex-girlfriend Daphne Joy.</p>



<p>The rapper dated Joy several years ago, and they share a son, 12-year-old Sire, together.</p>



<p>The allegations come on the heels of news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/daphne-joy-mother-of-50-cents-son-named-in-diddy-sex-trafficking-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joy was named in Rodney Jones&#8217; lawsuit against Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Jones alleged in his filing that Joy is a sex worker who was trafficked by Diddy.</p>

<p>50 has been trolling Diddy for weeks amid the mogul&#8217;s barrage of legal troubles, and he was quick to capitalize on the news that his ex was involved in the drama.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know you was a sex worker, you little sex worker,” 50 wrote on Twitter this week.</p>



<p>Joy was quick to fire back at 50, accusing him of raping and physically abusing her throughout their relationship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put the real focus on your true evil actions of raping me and physically abusing me. You are no longer my oppressor and my God will handle you from this point on,&#8221; Joy wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have permanently damaged the last hope I had for you as a father to preserve our family with these last and final false claims made against me,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have broken our hearts for the last and final time.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>From there, Joy accused her ex of being a negligent father to their son, writing:</p>



<p>&#8220;We moved to New York to give you the opportunity to be a father to your son and you saw him 10 times out of the 2 years that we lived 1 mile away from you.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am tired of upholding and protecting an image to our son that you have never even earned.&#8221;</p>

<p>50 Cent responded to Joy&#8217;s allegations via his attorneys, who issued a statement to <em><a href="https://people.com/50-cent-ex-daphne-joy-accuses-rapper-of-sexual-and-physical-abuse-8622008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The disturbing allegations in the sworn pleadings recently filed in a court case related to Daphne Joy, the mother of my twelve year old child, has required me to take all necessary legal actions to protect my son Sire,&#8221; the statement reads.</p>



<p>&#8220;The most recent false and baseless accusations by Daphne Joy are clearly in response to my decision to seek sole custody of my son. </p>



<p>&#8220;My son Sire is my main priority and keeping him in a safe environment is my only focus at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dahpne Joy may not be a household name, but she&#8217;s an important figure in the lives of some of hip hop&#8217;s biggest stars. And, her involvement with Diddy is currently bringing her a great deal of unwanted attention.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, Diddy is under investigation by federal authorities following a string of allegations from former associates.</p>



<p>His trouble began when R&amp;B singer <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/diddy-sued-by-cassie-ventura-for-rape-and-sex-trafficking-in-bombshell-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cassie filed a lawsuit</a> alleging that the legendary hip hop mogul had repeatedly abused her over the course of their romantic relationship.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, a former employee named <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/diddy-rodney-jones-sexual-assault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roland Jones sued Diddy for sexual assault</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-s-mounting-legal-woes">Diddy&#8217;s Mounting Legal Woes</h2>



<p>Diddy now stands accused of human trafficking, and two of his properties were raided by the Department of Homeland Security on Monday.</p>



<p>It was initially rumored that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/diddy-on-the-run-did-the-embattled-hip-hop-mogul-flee-the-us-following-raids-on-his-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy was on the run</a> from the authorities and had fled to Antigua on his private jet.</p>



<p>But we now know that the rapper was intercepted at a Miami airport and is still in the US.</p>

<p>One of his associates was arrested at the scene, but Diddy remains a free man.</p>

<p>Joy might already be familiar to some hip hop fans as a former girlfriend of 50 Cent and the mother of the rapper&#8217;s 12-year-old son, Sire.</p>

<p>However, Joy&#8217;s always outspoken ex was quick to remark upon the situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t know you was a sex worker, you little sex worker,&#8221; 50 Cent wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1773188333104976184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>X </em>(formerly <em>Twitter</em>),</a> adding:</p>

<p>50 has been trolling Diddy for weeks now, at one point even offering to finance a documentary about his rival&#8217;s legal woes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s not Diddy do it, it&#8217;s Diddy done they don&#8217;t come like that unless they got a case,&#8221; 50 <a href="https://twitter.com/50cent/status/1772383564790706619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> after Diddy&#8217;s houses were raided.</p>



<p>Diddy, of course, has been doing all of his talking through his attorneys, who recently blasted Jones as a shameless opportunist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lil Rod is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit, shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday,” Diddy’s lawyer Shawn Holley said.</p>



<p>“His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines,&#8221; Holley continued, adding:</p>



<p>“We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies. We will address these outlandish allegations in court and take all appropriate action against those who make them.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>50 Cent shed an impressive 40 pounds, and question going around is if he used Ozempic to do it.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/danielle-cabral-condemns-ozempic-misuse-for-weight-loss-run-on-a-f-king-treadmill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial weight-loss use of Ozempic</a> is running rampant among the rich and famous.</p>



<p>So, too, are questions about who&#8217;s using the life-saving diabetes drug as a luxury appetite suppressant.</p>



<p>50 Cent is only the latest to weigh in. And he&#8217;s not mincing words as he describes how he transformed his body.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-50-cent-did-not-use-ozempic-to-lose-weight">50 Cent did not use Ozempic to lose weight</h2>



<p>Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2gOspetvkH/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> on Wednesday, January 24, 50 Cent spoke directly to followers &#8212; as you can see below &#8212; to debunk rumors.</p>



<p>“Everybody talking about weight loss,&#8221; he reflected. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was in the gym. I was working the f&#8211;k out, man,&#8221; 50 Cent explained, demanding: &#8220;Who says Ozempic?”</p>

<p>All told, he lost about 40 pounds over the course of his fitness journey.</p>



<p>“I was running. I was running,” 50 Cent detailed. “I was doing what I had to do.”</p>



<p>He added to followers: “You seen me on tour. I was running around. I was 253 pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beginning at 253 pounds, 50 Cent is currently down to about 210.</p>



<p>Though both of these can be healthy and normal weights for an adult man (though at 5&#8217;11&#8221; 50 Cent is a bit on the short side), it sounds like he feels better and is happier with is body as it is.</p>



<p>“So how you feel about it?” the rapper then prompted his fans and followers.</p>

<p>From there, 50 Cent declined to further elaborate on his exercise routine.</p>



<p>Truth be told, &#8220;running&#8221; may be the long and short of it. Though repetitive motion can lead to added wear on joints and tissue, sometimes the key to exercise is finding one thing that you hate least and doing that.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s most important, in the minds of many fans, is 50 Cent slamming the rumors that he used Ozempic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-praise-50-cent-for-shutting-down-ozempic-rumors">Fans praise 50 Cent for shutting down Ozempic rumors</h2>



<p>Though 50 Cent is not the first to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/sam-asghari-weight-loss-isnt-ozempic-but-is-he-shading-britney-spears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debunk Ozempic rumors</a> after weight loss, it&#8217;s important.</p>



<p>First, these public statements remind people that there are many paths to weight loss. Some strategies are more successful for some than for others, but not every body transformation happens because of a syringe.</p>



<p>Second, because even if one ignores <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jennifer-fessler-is-still-on-ozempic-after-hospitalization-im-not-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known health risks to using Ozempic</a>, there are major ethical concerns.</p>

<p>Ozempic is a brand name for semaglutide injections.</p>



<p>This can be a life-saving diabetes medication. However, in recent years, it has become a luxury weight loss drug among the rich.</p>



<p>To simplify, these injections reduce appetite. While side effects are one concern, the weight loss use of Ozempic has caused documented shortages in multiple continents &#8212; to the chagrin of diabetes patients.</p>

<p>Anyone could hypothetically use Ozempic and then lie about weight loss. But that&#8217;s not the case with 50 Cent.</p>



<p><em>Page Six</em> spoke to an inside source to confirm that <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/01/25/entertainment/50-cent-shuts-down-ozempic-speculation-lost-40-pounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 Cent was not on Ozempic</a> but had taken part in a &#8220;rigorous&#8221; training program over eight months. He trained for three hours a day, <em>every </em>day.</p>



<p>50 Cent has the <em>real </em>magical key to weight loss: money. Money gives you the time and resources to lose weight that the majority of Americans cannot afford.</p>

Williams</a>, the beloved actor who became an icon thanks to his roles on some of the the 21st century&#8217;s finest television shows.</p>
<p>The Sopranos, Community, Boardwalk Empire, and Lovecraft Country would not have been the same were it not for Williams&#8217; unique mix of glowering menace and self-effacing humor.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s his role as Omar Little on the acclaimed series The Wire for which Williams will best be remembered.</p>
<p>Omar was such an iconic figure that he&#8217;s still name-dropped by rappers more than 13 years after The Wire aired its final episode.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But apparently, one notoriously petty hip hop artist was very much <em>not</em> a fan of Williams or his legendary work on screen.</p>
<p>Yes, in case you were unaware, rapper 50 Cent is clearly suffering through some sort of undiagnosed personality disorder.</p>
<p>Either that, or he&#8217;s still pissed off that his one good album dropped like 20 years ago, and no one has really given a sh-t about him since.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, a quick scroll through his Instagram page will lead you to understand why <a href="/2018/11/50-cent-i-hope-my-son-gets-hit-by-a-bus/">50&#8217;s own son hates him</a>.</p>
<p>The man is a hateful, homophobic has-been whose past career successes have done little to soften his contempt for humanity.</p>
<p>And what does all of this have to with the death of Michael K. Williams, you ask?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1003" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/michael-k-williams-1003x1024.jpg" alt="Michael K.

<p>Well, it seems that 50 and Williams didn&#8217;t always see eye to eye during tha actor&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>And so, when 50 received word of Williams&#8217; death, he felt the need to insult the actor and mock his battle with addiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn if you didn&rsquo;t see Raising Kanan check it out that fentanyl is no joke, killing the clientele,&rdquo; the rapper crudely joked in an Instagram post.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>He also used the opportunity to fulfill his sponsored content obligation with a brand of cognac, ending his post with a hashtag of the company&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Obviously, 50 also seized this chance to plug his Starz series Power Book III: Raising Kanan, which could best be described as a cut-rate Wire rip-off.</p>
<p>The joke about drug dealers &quot;killing the clientele&quot; by adding fentanyl to cocaine and heroin did not go over well with fans.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>50 later clarified his distaste for Williams with a screenshot from a Page Six article.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#8217;t ever try to understand me I&#8217;m different. I don&#8217;t do all the fake love sh-t,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>As for the cause of 50&#8217;s contempt for Williams, it may have had to do with the rapper&#8217;s well-known homophobia.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Omar Little was openly gay, and also a feared and respected figure on The Wire &#8212; a combination that&#8217;s sadly uncommon on television.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael K. Williams made queer Black masculinity iconic,&quot; reads one NBC headline from the day after Williams&#8217; passing.</p>
<p>&quot;Gay Black men rarely saw themselves on screen. Michael K. Williams changed that,&quot; CNN wrote.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As Page Six <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/07/50-cent-uses-death-of-michael-k-williams-to-promote-tv-show/">reports</a>, 50 was blasted by fans in response to his vile remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;50 Cent is my favorite rapper ever, but this is disrespectful as hell and corny,&rdquo; one follower wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a bi&#8211;h for that, can&rsquo;t defend the n&mdash;a no mo.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-683x1024.jpg" alt="Curtis Jackson" class="wp-image-293162" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;Idc what anyone says, using someone&rsquo;s tragic &amp; untimely death to promote your own show with an insensitive ass caption is VILE,&rdquo; a second person chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;50 Cent has always been ignorant, but this is crossing the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third called 50 &ldquo;honestly disgusting and disrespectful as hell for this post,&quot; adding &quot;@50cent should go to jail for that post.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Michael K. Williams was a genius-caliber talent who lived life boldly and on his own terms.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, he would have shrugged off a petty comment from a small mind such as 50&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Even so, we can&#8217;t help but be outraged on Williams&#8217; behalf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Even though&nbsp;<a href="/2019/07/50-cent-body-shames-wendy-williams-this-bish-is-so-scrawny/">50 Cent is no stranger to body-shaming</a>&nbsp;women, this time, he&#8217;s getting accused of being more than just a douchecanoe.</p>
<p>After he forced his girlfriend Cuban Link (apparently a real name) to delete an Instagram photo, fans are accusing him of being creepily controlling.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I kilt the gym today,&quot; Cuban wrote on Instagram. &quot;Or maybe the gym kilt me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But either way,&quot; she continued, &quot;I won!&quot;</p>
<p>Cuban&#8217;s caption continued with a hashtag that reads: &quot;Laundry Day Don&#8217;t Mind The Bed.&quot;</p>
<p>Accompanying her caption was a tantalizing glimpse at her abdomen and the curve of her (clothed) hip. Definitely a thirst trap.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Cuban is dating notorious rapper 50 Cent, who saw the photo of his gorgeous girlfriend &#8230; but was far from impressed.</p>
<p>&quot;I just landed,&quot; 50 Cent commented alongside a series of unhappy emojis. &quot;Now why you gotta be doing s&#8211;t like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You send this s&#8211;t to my phone,&quot; he demanded, &quot;not to Instagram.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the f&#8211;k?&quot; he asked at the end.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Possibly realizing that it was he, not Cuban, who had posted something unacceptable online, 50 Cent later added a softer comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Very pretty baby, see you don&rsquo;t need to go out,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>50 Cent then added: &quot;Plus, it&rsquo;s a snow storm it&rsquo;s nasty out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay in the house,&quot; he concluded his comment, as if concerned that she would wander the streets in her underwear. &quot;LOL.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="730" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-1024x730.jpg" alt="Fiddy" class="wp-image-223696" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-300x214.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-768x548.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-1536x1096.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-2048x1461.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-735x524.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-335x239.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-347x248.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-520x371.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-640x457.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-960x685.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/fiddy-1080x770.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images for DuJour)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Softer follow-up comment or not, Cuban did delete the post.</p>
<p>50 Cent is a notorious jerk, so it&#8217;s not really surprising to witness that he has weird control issues.</p>
<p>Naturally, 50 Cent&#8217;s detractors &#8212; that is, people who know anything about 50 Cent and possess basic moral reasoning &#8212; are giving him hell.</p>
<p>What kind of tool forces his girlfriend to delete a safe-for-Instagram thirst trap? 50 Cent, that&#8217;s who.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;But she was doing that before you are sure that&rsquo;s how she got his attention now. It&rsquo;s a problem,&quot; one person comments.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty sure this, not the first time, if she was doing this before yall was together, and you saw that what made you think it would be different?&quot; another asks.</p>
<p>They continue: &quot;Gotta take ppl for what they are at the moment you decide to be with them, they will change up certain behaviors if they want.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In other words, these fans are suggesting that 50 Cent not try to forcibly change someone he&#8217;s dating. Date someone hot, they&#8217;re gonna stay hot.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Cuban is not only an aspiring corporate attorney, but an avid fitness nut who encourages others to follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>That is to say that part of her business is showing off the results of all of her hard work at the gym.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-683x1024.jpg" alt="Curtis Jackson" class="wp-image-293162" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/curtis-jackson-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>When 50 Cent orders her to delete hot photos because he has weird, jealous hangups about her body, he&#8217;s also hurting her business.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; he also appears to be behaving in a toxic and controlling manner. You don&#8217;t order people to take down their pics.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know what sort of choices one goes through in life that they end up dating 50 Cent. We just hope that it&#8217;s worth it for Cuban.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to choose a &quot;most random&quot; from the rapper&#8217;s long list of unlikely enemies, but <a href="/2019/04/50-cent-vs-lala-kent-insane-feud-explodes-on-instagram/">50&#8217;s feud with Lala Kent</a> of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> fame certainly caught a lot of fans off-guard.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="/2019/05/lala-kent-and-randall-emmett-the-engagement-is-off-is-50-cent-to/">Lala is engaged to Randall Emmett</a>, a producer on 50&#8217;s Starz series Power.</p>
<p>Back in April, Mr. Cent publicly called Emmett out and insisted that he pay back a $1 million loan.</p>
<p>50 being 50, he screenshotted Randall&#8217;s blubbering apologies, which included claims that anxiety from the situation had landed him in the hospital, as well as a typo &#8212; &quot;Fofty&quot; &#8212; that has since become a nickname for the rapper.</p>
<p>Last week, Lala appeared on Andy Cohen&#8217;s <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>, and when a caller asked about her &quot;relationship with Fofty&quot; Kent &#8211;perhaps unintentionally &#8212; reignited the feud.</p>

<p>At first, Lala attempted to brush off the question, saying,&nbsp;&quot;I mean, I listened to &#8216;In Da Club&#8217; on my birthday, so that was pretty lit.&quot;</p>
<p>But when Cohen followed up, she said:</p>
<p>&quot;I think I really dinged Fofty&#8217;s ego. In fact, I know that, because I have a receipt to prove that, which I would never post, because I ain&#8217;t that girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if she&#8217;s proud to have so thoroughly gotten 50&#8217;s goat, Lala applied in the affirmative:</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! I&#8217;m from Utah! And to think it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Tupac and Biggie, Lala and Fifty.&#8217; Like, what up, though?&quot;</p>

<p>Receipt or no receipt, it seems Fofty was not a fan of Lala&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#8217;s wrong with this hoe?&quot; he captioned a screenshot from her WWHL appearance.</p>
<p>&quot;Now don&#8217;t say she didn&#8217;t ask for it when I start tripping,&quot; he added, ominously.</p>
<p>And with that,&nbsp;Fofty was off to the races.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh this bitch be drunk 4 days straight,&quot; he captioned a since-deleted photo of Lala.</p>

<p>&quot;She must just be on some drunk hoe, I don&#8217;t remember type s&#8211;t,&quot; the rapper added.</p>
<p>&quot;Have a drink, hit da powda, have a drink, hit da powda, have a draink, hit da powda 4 days straight.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the oddly specific remark about Lala&#8217;s alleged bender, 50 shared a number of unflattering photos of Emmett.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he falls in LOVE with the hoe, and they live drunk and high happily ever after,&quot; he captioned one.</p>
<p>He then screenshotted Lala&#8217;s latest Instagram Story and added a message for the reality star.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Shut up bitch, you started with the wrong person good night,&quot; he captioned the image.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/12/lala-kent-im-60-days-sober-and-i-still-hate-james-kennedy/">Lala is sober</a> after struggling with alcoholism for several years.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that she took issue with claims that she&#8217;s a cocaine user who recently embarked on a bender:</p>
<p>&quot;I feel it&#8217;s important for me to say this, and I&#8217;m only going to address this once&hellip;&quot; she wrote in a lengthy response to the allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;My sobriety is something I&#8217;m proud of and work on [every day]. I&#8217;ve never done cocaine nor were any other substances, other than alcohol, involved in my decision to get sober.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I pride myself on being open and honest about everything in my life, hopefully inspiring others and letting them know they are not alone. The past couple of days I&#8217;ve been slammed to say the very least,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;People have asked me how I&#8217;m maintaining keeping my head up&hellip; To me it&#8217;s simple&mdash;I know Real Life from the illusion of social media. I know what it feels like to have your world crumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting a phone call from your brother saying your dad has passed away&hellip;that is earth-shattering. Being called names and being falsely accused of things&hellip;that is far from earth-shattering.&quot;</p>
<p>Kent concluded by saying that while she&#8217;s strong enough to withstand 50&#8217;s onslaught, others might not be able to survive such an attack:</p>

<p>&quot;My mindset is something I&#8217;m grateful for&mdash;however I can&#8217;t help but think about how many people are taking their own lives, daily, due to cyberbullying,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;It is imperative that I tell you, you are not by yourself. I see you. I stand by you. I&#8217;m on your team.</p>
<p>&quot;You are loved and make a difference in this world.&quot;</p>
<p>It may not be Biggie vs. Tupac &#8212; but this feud is certainly serious business.</p>
