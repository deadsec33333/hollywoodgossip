<p>After encouragement from fans an a warm reception, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/amanda-bynes-unpauses-podcast-ive-lined-up-exciting-guests/">Amanda Bynes lined up guests for her new podcast</a>.</p>



<p>This news came after her decision to &#8220;pause&#8221; the project after its first episode.</p>



<p>Now, Amanda has a new update: she&#8217;s pivoting to something a little less public.</p>



<p>But her goals make sense. She wants stability and a regular income.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="915" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png" alt="Amanda Bynes appears with blonde hair in this still from a video explaining her facial surgery." class="wp-image-488685" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png 601w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-197x300.png 197w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-220x335.png 220w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-228x347.png 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-342x520.png 342w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-420x640.png 420w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-504x768.png 504w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In early December 2023, Amanda Bynes took to her Instagram Story to share an update on her look.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Late on Thursday, December 21, any followers checking their Stories on the Winter Solstice received some news from Amanda Bynes.</p>



<p>&#8220;The 1st episode of my podcast did really well,&#8221; she acknowledged.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was actually surprised,&#8221; Amanda admitted. &#8220;And of course was going to keep going after friends encouraged me to.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="576" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-576x1024.jpg" alt="An Instagram Story screenshot of Amanda Bynes explaining in white text that she is going to focus upon being a nail technician over her podcast." class="wp-image-489243" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-169x300.jpg 169w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-864x1536.jpg 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-1152x2048.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-735x1307.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-188x335.jpg 188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-195x347.jpg 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-293x520.jpg 293w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-360x640.jpg 360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-432x768.jpg 432w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-540x960.jpg 540w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02-608x1080.jpg 608w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1222_amandabynes_ig_02.jpg 1179w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In late December 2023, Amanda Bynes wrote that &#8212; despite encouragement from her friends &#8212; she was pivoting away from the podcast to focus upon having a regular job. That sounds very good for her mental health.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;After thinking about it, though,&#8221; Amanda wrote, &#8220;I would rather get my manicurist license and have a consistent job.&#8221;</p>



<p>She announced: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to follow that path instead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amanda concluded her update by writing: &#8220;Thank you for following my journey!&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png" alt="Amanda Bynes gestures to her cheek with one nail." class="wp-image-488687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png 574w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-188x335.png 188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-195x347.png 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-292x520.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-359x640.png 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-431x768.png 431w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-538x960.png 538w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02.png 605w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During an Instagram Story video, Amanda Bynes explains why she underwent Blepharoplasty.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We are sure that a lot of people are going to frame this announcement as a symptom of mental illness.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: though she has changed her mind on this in recent weeks, <em>wanting a consistent job </em>is generally a sign of mental stability and clarity.</p>



<p>At the risk of shading a lot of podcasters out there, maybe the world would be a better place if fewer people decided to hitch their dreams on the idea of podcasting as a career.</p>

<p>It has been nearly two years since Amanda Bynes&#8217; 9-year conservatorship came to an end. Her parents supported the dissolution of it, noting her marked improvement.</p>



<p>Reports say that, despite the setbacks earlier this year &#8212; during which Amanda sought help, like anyone with mental health issues should &#8212; she is doing very well.</p>



<p>Amanda is taking back control of her life and making her own choices, from her career path to her car.</p>

<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/amanda-bynes-is-taking-back-control-after-conservatorship/">by <em>Life &amp; Style</em></a>, Amanda is taking inspiration from another very famous ex-conservatee.</p>



<p>“Amanda even says she’s considering writing a tell-all, just like Britney Spears,&#8221; an inside source shared.</p>



<p>The insider added: &#8220;She has been inspired by Britney and how she’s also gone through hell with her own conservatorship and come out the other side.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes shared this selfie around the end of her conservatorship. Instagram followers expressed their delight.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like we said, Amanda has experienced mental health setbacks this year. At one point, she realized that she was outside and underdressed. Another time, she experience self-harm ideation. She sought help, and received it.</p>



<p>This is exactly what a person who needs help should do. And it&#8217;s not the behavior of someone who needs a conservatorship.</p>



<p>We are proud of Amanda and inspired by the steps that she is taking to control and improve her life.</p>

<p>As we reported earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/amanda-bynes-podcast-on-pause-after-one-episode-doesnt-want-to-discuss-mental-health/">Amanda Bynes put her podcast on &#8220;pause&#8221;</a> after its premiere episode.</p>



<p>This came as a surprise, as it was already doing well.</p>



<p>At the time, Amanda explained her reasoning for placing this project on hiatus.</p>



<p>Fortunately, she has now changed her tune &#8212; and guests are already lining up.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="599" height="801" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02.png" alt="Amanda Bynes stands in an elevator and takes a photo of dancing lights and her own reflection." class="wp-image-488028" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02.png 599w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-224x300.png 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-360x480.png 360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-240x320.png 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-251x335.png 251w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-259x347.png 259w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-389x520.png 389w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-479x640.png 479w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-574x768.png 574w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes snapped this vibrant mirror selfie in 2023 and shared it to Instagram.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As we reported a couple of months ago, Amanda Bynes was working on an exciting new project. She and her friend launched <em>Amanda Bynes &amp; Paul Sieminski: The Podcast</em> just recently.</p>



<p>Despite her decades of fame, Amanda has been in headlines but not so much in communication with the public for much of the past decade or so.</p>



<p>But now, her conservatorship is no more. She is managing her own mental health &#8212; and asking for help when she needs it. Obviously, fans expressed excitement at her new venture.</p>

<p>However, just days ago, she announced that she was putting this podcast on &#8220;pause.&#8221;</p>



<p>There had been just one episode.</p>



<p>According to Amanda, her reasoning was that she had not been able to secure the kinds of big-name guests that she wanted right off the bat. She cited people like Drake, Jack Harlow, and Post Malone.</p>

<p>According to Amanda, we can all thank her friends for her new change of heart.</p>



<p>She is no longer &#8220;pausing&#8221; the podcast.</p>



<p>Instead, she now feels excited to record the new episode. And, we hope, many more.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png" alt="Amanda Bynes gestures to her cheek with one nail." class="wp-image-488687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png 574w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-188x335.png 188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-195x347.png 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-292x520.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-359x640.png 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-431x768.png 431w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-538x960.png 538w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02.png 605w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During an Instagram Story video, Amanda Bynes explains why she underwent Blepharoplasty.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember, the podcast will take time to obtain the kind of can&#8217;t-ignore following that will draw the guests she wants.</p>



<p>It is already doing very well on Spotify and other platforms.</p>



<p>And Amanda shared that she has already lined up guests for upcoming episodes, with more to come soon!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-819x1024.jpg" alt="Amanda Bynes stands against a wall while wearing yellow plaid." class="wp-image-488027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-768x960.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-735x919.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-268x335.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-278x347.jpg 278w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-416x520.jpg 416w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-512x640.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-614x768.jpg 614w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-864x1080.jpg 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In recent years, Amanda Bynes has used Instagram to update fans and supporters on her life.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One thing that may have surprised many fans about the podcast is that it&#8217;s not about the obvious topics.</p>



<p>Amanda was a child star. She helped make Nickelodeon&#8217;s live action comedy scene what it is. <em>Without The Amanda Show</em>, the world might never have seen <em>Drake &amp; Josh</em>, <em>iCarly</em>, or <em>Victorious</em>. She even launched a career as an adult actress.</p>



<p>Additionally, Amanda&#8217;s mental health journey included multiple crises, a lengthy conservatorship, and numerous public scandals. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="915" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png" alt="Amanda Bynes appears with blonde hair in this still from a video explaining her facial surgery." class="wp-image-488685" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png 601w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-197x300.png 197w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-220x335.png 220w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-228x347.png 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-342x520.png 342w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-420x640.png 420w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-504x768.png 504w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In early December 2023, Amanda Bynes took to her Instagram Story to share an update on her look.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But Amanda has no plans to discuss any of that &#8212; not her entertainment industry career and not her mental health experiences &#8212; on the podcast. That&#8217;s not what this is about.</p>



<p>Truth be told, it&#8217;s possible that delving into those topics would be bad for her mental health. There&#8217;s a reason that people discuss these things in therapeutic environments, you know?</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know how soon Amanda is going to land the interviews that she wants. But plenty of her fans and followers will be excited by whichever guests she&#8217;s already lined up.</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/amanda-bynes-teases-new-project-reassures-worried-fans/">Amanda Bynes revealed her exciting new project</a>.</p>



<p>She is no longer working as an actor. But given her lifetime of experience as a public figure, she&#8217;s a great person to give interviews within the entertainment industry.</p>



<p>From the start, Amanda has had no plans to discuss her mental health journey on this show. That&#8217;s not what this project is about.</p>



<p>But that podcast is also on &#8220;pause&#8221; for the moment. Amanda made this difficult decision after only one episode.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="915" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png" alt="Amanda Bynes appears with blonde hair in this still from a video explaining her facial surgery." class="wp-image-488685" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png 601w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-197x300.png 197w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-220x335.png 220w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-228x347.png 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-342x520.png 342w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-420x640.png 420w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-504x768.png 504w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In early December 2023, Amanda Bynes took to her Instagram Story to share an update on her look.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On Sunday, December 17, Amanda Bynes broke some disappointing news just in time for the start of Saturnalia.</p>



<p>She did share that her podcast, Amanda Bynes &amp; Pauls SIeminski: The Podcast, was doing well. And she appreciates the responses.</p>



<p>However, she announced, &#8220;I am going to take a pause on it for now.&#8221; But why?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="599" height="801" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02.png" alt="Amanda Bynes stands in an elevator and takes a photo of dancing lights and her own reflection." class="wp-image-488028" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02.png 599w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-224x300.png 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-360x480.png 360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-240x320.png 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-251x335.png 251w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-259x347.png 259w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-389x520.png 389w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-479x640.png 479w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-574x768.png 574w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes snapped this vibrant mirror selfie in 2023 and shared it to Instagram.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amanda shared on her Instagram Story that a major obstacle was that they weren&#8217;t getting the guests that they&#8217;d hoped to land.</p>



<p>She specifically listed people like Drake, Jack Harlow, and Post Malone. </p>



<p>Famously, during her extended mental health crisis from more than a decade ago, Amanda tweeted a desire to have Drake &#8220;murder&#8221; her vagina. While it became a bit of a meme, it was arguably a cry for help.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png" alt="Amanda Bynes gestures to her cheek with one nail." class="wp-image-488687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png 574w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-188x335.png 188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-195x347.png 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-292x520.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-359x640.png 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-431x768.png 431w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-538x960.png 538w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02.png 605w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During an Instagram Story video, Amanda Bynes explains why she underwent Blepharoplasty.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re able to get those kinds of guests,&#8221; Amanda shared with fans, they will resume.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for now, that&#8217;s not the plan.</p>



<p>It sounds like this podcast did not have a lineup of guests before they launched. That&#8217;s probably something that you&#8217;d want to figure out before the first episode. Now, Amanda knows that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes shared this selfie around the end of her conservatorship. Instagram followers expressed their delight.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Truth be told, plenty of listeners would rather hear about Amanda than from any of those men.</p>



<p>After all, Amanda grew up as a child star. She was instrumental in launching the live action Nickelodeon universe. It&#8217;s probably safe to say that without <em>The Amanda Show</em>, we might never have gotten <em>Drake &amp; Josh</em> or<em> iCarly</em> or <em>Victorious</em>.</p>



<p>And then of course came Amanda&#8217;s infamous mental health struggles. More than a decade ago, this very public issue was a hot topic. Ultimately, her parents placed her under a conservatorship &#8212; which they recently dissolved so that Amanda can live her own life.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-819x1024.jpg" alt="Amanda Bynes stands against a wall while wearing yellow plaid." class="wp-image-488027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-768x960.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-735x919.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-268x335.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-278x347.jpg 278w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-416x520.jpg 416w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-512x640.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-614x768.jpg 614w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-864x1080.jpg 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In recent years, Amanda Bynes has used Instagram to update fans and supporters on her life.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, a lot of people are much more interested in hearing about all of that. Especially from Amanda&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>But she&#8217;s not keen on delving into that on a podcast right now. Why? That&#8217;s her business. But the simplest explanation is that it would dredge up some really unpleasant topics.</p>



<p>We wish Amanda the very best. She&#8217;s a treasure and she deserves peace and success. She might want to set more realistic goals for guests, though. Just saying.</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/amanda-bynes-teases-new-project-reassures-worried-fans/">Amanda Bynes teased an upcoming project</a>.</p>



<p>This was very encouraging news to her fans. As we all know, Amanda had a rough go of it earlier this year.</p>



<p>Now, she&#8217;s back on track. And she has another update for her followers.</p>



<p>Notice anything different about her face? She underwent a minor cosmetic surgery that has given her a major confidence boost.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="915" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png" alt="Amanda Bynes appears with blonde hair in this still from a video explaining her facial surgery." class="wp-image-488685" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01.png 601w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-197x300.png 197w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-220x335.png 220w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-228x347.png 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-342x520.png 342w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-420x640.png 420w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_01-504x768.png 504w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In early December 2023, Amanda Bynes took to her Instagram Story to share an update on her look.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amanda Bynes&#8217; recent Instagram Stories include video in which she shows her face and explains one subtle change that she&#8217;s made.</p>



<p>Obviously, she&#8217;s sporting blonde locks. Her eyebrows are drawn in (which is not uncommon, particularly with certain medical conditions). And she has been incrementally working to remove the heart tattoo from her cheek.</p>



<p>But Amanda also revealed that she underwent cosmetic surgery on her eyelids.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png" alt="Amanda Bynes gestures to her cheek with one nail." class="wp-image-488687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-574x1024.png 574w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-188x335.png 188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-195x347.png 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-292x520.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-359x640.png 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-431x768.png 431w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02-538x960.png 538w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1212_amandabynes_02.png 605w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During an Instagram Story video, Amanda Bynes explains why she underwent Blepharoplasty.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Blepharoplasty&#8221; might sound like either the name of Alexander the Great&#8217;s horse or the name of that ancient Greek twink who rode Pegasus and fought the chimera.</p>



<p>(Bucephalus and Bellerophon, respectively)</p>



<p>But blepharoplasty is a form of plastic surgery. The procedure removes the skinfolds around the corners of one&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Amanda explained to her fans and followers that this surgery has resulted in a major boost to her self-confidence.</p>



<p>It is also  making her feel better about herself.</p>



<p>Amanda expressed that this is one of the greatest things that she has ever done for herself. Good for her!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="599" height="801" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02.png" alt="Amanda Bynes stands in an elevator and takes a photo of dancing lights and her own reflection." class="wp-image-488028" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02.png 599w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-224x300.png 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-360x480.png 360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-240x320.png 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-251x335.png 251w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-259x347.png 259w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-389x520.png 389w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-479x640.png 479w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1130_amandabynes_02-574x768.png 574w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes snapped this vibrant mirror selfie in 2023 and shared it to Instagram.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, Amanda explained why she was sharing this detail.</p>



<p>After all, her cosmetic surgery was a personal decision. It is only our business if she chooses to make it so.</p>



<p>But Amanda observed that a lot of fans commented that she looked different last month when she announced her podcast project. That&#8217;s why she decided to go public.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes shared this selfie around the end of her conservatorship. Instagram followers expressed their delight.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As we mentioned, Amanda had a very challenging year. She suffered a mental health incident, and then called for help because she realized that she needed it.</p>



<p>The same thing happened again, later. Amanda underwent treatment to get her back on track.</p>



<p>Some have mistakenly taken this as an opportunity to say that Amanda should still be in a conservatorship. This is unequivocally false.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-819x1024.jpg" alt="Amanda Bynes stands against a wall while wearing yellow plaid." class="wp-image-488027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-768x960.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-735x919.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-268x335.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-278x347.jpg 278w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-416x520.jpg 416w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-512x640.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-614x768.jpg 614w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes-864x1080.jpg 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1207_amandabynes.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In recent years, Amanda Bynes has used Instagram to update fans and supporters on her life.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, conservatorships &#8212; where someone else becomes the guardian of an adult &#8212; are not for Amanda at all. Just as they are not for Britney.</p>



<p>As legal experts and human rights advocates noted during the Free Britney movement, these legal arrangements are for people who do not know where they are. </p>



<p>A conservatorship is for someone who gets lost in their own kitchen, who cannot live their life, who does not object to the conservatorship because they do not know what one is or cannot remember that they are under one.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="572" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-572x1024.png" alt="A 2021 selfie from Amanda Bynes, featuring drawn-on eyebrows." class="wp-image-488690" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-572x1024.png 572w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-187x335.png 187w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-194x347.png 194w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-291x520.png 291w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-358x640.png 358w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-429x768.png 429w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-536x960.png 536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1-603x1080.png 603w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/0113_amandabynes_1.png 694w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In early 2021, Amanda Bynes shared this selfie with her fans and followers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, the fact that Amanda has repeatedly recognized when she needed help and sought it? That&#8217;s very encouraging.</p>



<p>Millions of Americans have mental health issues. Some have crisis experiences requiring intervention and hospitalization.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t get to live their lives. We&#8217;re rooting for Amanda. Her progress has been inspirational.</p>

<p>Early this summer, Amanda Bynes entered voluntary inpatient treatment after struggling with her mental health.</p>



<p>It was encouraging to see her once again reach out when she knew that she needed help. She saw the problem and sought the healthcare that got her back on track.</p>



<p>We have all felt so encouraged by seeing Amanda recover. Her fans want to see her thrive.</p>



<p>Amanda just revealed her next big step: she&#8217;s launching a brand new project. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Amanda Bynes shared the news.</p>



<p>She and her good friend, Paul Sieminski, are launching a podcast together.</p>



<p>The focus will be the entertainment industry. That is a topic with which Amanda is extremely familiar.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes shared this selfie around the end of her conservatorship. Instagram followers expressed their delight.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On Wednesday, Amanda told TooFab a bit more about her project.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m working on a podcast about the entertainment industry with my best friend Paul Sieminski who is a biochemist and scientist,&#8221; she shared. &#8220;We met in treatment and have very similar interests.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amanda affirmed: &#8220;Our goal is to start a beauty brand in the future. Our podcast will be on Spotify and it&#8217;s called <em>Paul &amp; Amanda: The Podcast</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Amanda, their focus will be &#8220;fashion, artists, actors, actresses, music, and everything else!&#8221; Well, that covers every conceivable topic, but we can understand the focus.</p>



<p>Amanda took to Instagram to share further details in a video post.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super impressive that Paul is going to be a part of it because he&#8217;s a scientist and a biochemist,&#8221; she shared. &#8220;So having his beautiful mind being a part of this podcast is just going to bring it to another level I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amanda elaborated: &#8220;&#8217;cause he&#8217;s going to ask great questions. And I think he&#8217;ll kind of carry most of the weight in terms of just like, topics of conversation.&#8221; That is exciting!</p>



<p>As we reported, Amanda checked herself into an Orange County mental health treatment center in early July. This came right on the heels of her departure from another facility.</p>



<p>Recently, Amanda has been undergoing a different kind of treatment &#8212; removal of the heart tattoo on her face. Mental health recovery looks different on different people.</p>

<p>Two decades ago, Amanda Bynes was a teen Nickelodeon star. The child actress enjoyed multiple roles on that network and, at one time, appeared to be beginning a promising film career.</p>



<p>However, her worsening health became impossible to ignore &#8212; in paparazzi photos and on social media.</p>



<p>We love to see her improving her life now that she is free of her conservatorship. Amanda deserves to make her own choices &#8212; including her own healthcare decisions. We&#8217;re excited for the podcast!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s extremely normal for anyone undergoing long term mental health treatment to have ups and downs and even major setbacks.</p>



<p>In June, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/amanda-bynes-psychiatric-hold-extended-after-mental-health-crisis/">Amanda Bynes had a mental health crisis</a>. She knew that she needed help, so she got it.</p>



<p>More recently, she has been seeking outpatient care. But sometimes, that&#8217;s not enough.</p>



<p>She has checked herself into an inpatient facility. It&#8217;s what she needs, and she knows it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former child star Amanda Bynes turned her life around dramatically, furthering her education and working on her mental health.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amanda Bynes has been a beloved actress for many years &#8212; even after leaving the entertainment industry behind.</p>



<p>For years, her struggles with mental illness have made the news. It turns out that her funny tweets from over a decade ago wouldn&#8217;t have happened if she&#8217;d been in a healthier state of mind.</p>



<p>In recent years, Amanda made tremendous strides. Her conservatorship ended, she began living on her own, and her mental health recovery has been encouraging.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes stands against a wall while wearing a yellow plaid top in this 2020 Instagram post. Her fans love seeing these little updates after all that she has been through.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But there have been setbacks. Earlier this year, she realized that she was having a mental health crisis. Naked and outside, she called for help.</p>



<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/amanda-bynes-recovery-update-shes-doing-so-well-but-shes-kinda-miserable/">Amanda&#8217;s recovery</a> has continued.</p>



<p>In June, she had another crisis &#8212; albeit a less dramatic one. She reached out for help, and received it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sporting a creative dye job, Amanda Bynes snapped this selfie to share with her fans and followers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/30/amanda-bynes-checks-into-new-inpatient-mental-health-center/"><em>TMZ </em>reports</a>, Amanda is returning to voluntary inpatient mental health treatment.</p>



<p>In July, she entered the Orange County facility.</p>



<p>Why? As anyone who has voluntarily gone into inpatient care, she needed a more therapeutic environment than seeking outpatient care while living at home could provide.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes is opening up about her painful past. The former child star says her experiences in Hollywood had a lasting impact on her self-esteem.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It isn&#8217;t just about the medical team or the therapists, though they are certainly part of it.</p>



<p>At the Orange County facility, Amanda can engage in social interaction with other patients.</p>



<p>That is easier for her than being on her own. Not every mental illness is the same &#8212; what might be a nightmare for some is exactly what Amanda needs for her recovery.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes&#8217; fans have followed her story for years, including the ups and downs of her mental health. A lot of people continue to root for her.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, Amanda can simply receive a higher level of care from this inpatient treatment program.</p>



<p>Right now, she&#8217;s in a residential situation and has &#8217;round-the-clock care.</p>



<p>Then there are daily therapy sessions and activities. Some of which could help her to hone coping skills and more after she leaves this center.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this selfie, Amanda Bynes is wearing a light jacket and large glasses. Her lipstick is really vibrant!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is so important to emphasize that this is yet another example of Amanda identifying that she needs treatment and seeking it.</p>



<p>She has mental illness. That does not in any way change the fact that she is a human being with rights.</p>



<p>We are so glad that she continues to make good choices for herself. Amanda, the whole world is rooting for you.</p>

<p>One month ago, all reports made it clear that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/amanda-bynes-recovery-update-shes-doing-so-well-but-shes-kinda-miserable/">Amanda Bynes was doing well</a>. That was, of course, a relief.</p>



<p>But recovery is seldom a linear process. Particularly when it comes to mental illness, childhood trauma, and the complexities of life.</p>



<p>Last Saturday, she realized that she was having a mental health crisis and contacted authorities. Amanda ended up in a psychiatric hold.</p>



<p>Now, authorities have extended that hold while doctors work with Amanda. But she won&#8217;t be going home any time soon.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes stands against a wall while wearing a yellow plaid top in this 2020 Instagram post. Her fans love seeing these little updates after all that she has been through.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the weekend, the LAPD detained Amanda Bynes, placing her on a 5150 psychiatric hold. That hold means a 72-hour detention to determine if she might be a danger to herself.</p>



<p>What happened was that, on Saturday morning, they received a call from a woman in distress.</p>



<p>That woman turned out to be Amanda herself. The 37-year-old former actor had contacted emergency responders because she knew that she needed help.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former child star Amanda Bynes turned her life around dramatically, furthering her education and working on her mental health.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://amp.tmz.com/2023/06/17/amanda-bynes-detained-mental-health-evaluation-los-angeles/"><em>TMZ</em> was</a> the first tabloid to report on this, sharing that she remained &#8220;calm&#8221; during the interaction with police.</p>



<p>However, eyewitness accounts described Amanda as looking &#8220;defeated&#8221; during this.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/amanda-bynes-placed-back-on-5150-psychiatric-hold-after-being-detained-by-police-report-206630"><em>Entertainment Tonight</em> reported</a> that Amanda is doing her best to take care of herself. There is just one issue.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fans cheered on in 2022 as Amanda Bynes&#8217; conservatorship came to an end. It doesn&#8217;t mean an end to her mental health struggles, it simply means a restoration of her human rights.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Amanda was doing better recently and trying her best to take care of herself,&#8221; an insider reported.</p>



<p>&#8220;She has been making an effort to go to AA meetings, trying to hang out with sober people, and she looked good,&#8221; the source shared.</p>



<p>The insider then described: &#8220;The only problem is she is inconsistent about taking her medication, which causes issues.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this selfie, Amanda Bynes is wearing a light jacket and large glasses. Her lipstick is really vibrant!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;When Amanda was admitted to a mental facility a few months ago, things weren’t going as well for her,&#8221; the insider went on.</p>



<p>The source described: &#8220;She was very distressed, concerned about her past and reputation, surrounding herself with the wrong people who were bad influences, and not taking her medication.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the insider said that her loved ones &#8220;want her to get home safe and get settled. She is a great girl who means well and wants to get better.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes&#8217; fans have followed her story for years, including the ups and downs of her mental health. A lot of people continue to root for her.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/06/22/amanda-bynes-psychiatric-hold-extended-week-loved-ones-concerned-cycle-mental-breakdowns/"><em>TMZ</em> reports</a> that Amanda will remain under psychiatric observation for &#8220;at least another week.&#8221; In this time, doctors will try to stabilize her with medications and therapy.</p>



<p>Simply put, it sounds like Amanda is in a cycle that will sound familiar to many people with mental illness (and their loved ones). They take medication, then they feel better and stop taking it. Then, symptoms return.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t sound like this is likely to bring about a new conservatorship petition. Amanda is a grown woman with inalienable human rights. We just hope that she can find a medication routine that works for her. She deserves to live her best life.</p>

<p>More than two months ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/amanda-bynes-found-wandering-naked-in-downtown-la-placed-on-5150-psychiatric-hold/">Amanda Bynes sought psychiatric treatment</a> after experiencing a mental crisis.</p>



<p>Three weeks later, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/amanda-bynes-released-from-mental-hospital-actress-was-distraught-over-breakup-prior-to-breakdown/">Amanda was able to leave the hospital</a> and return home.</p>



<p>Now, she is doing so well in many ways &#8212; taking her medication, meeting with her therapist, and more.</p>



<p>But she is struggling to enjoy some of her previous passions. And those closest to her fear that she might get back with her ex.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes is back on Instagram. The former actress seems to be doing well, but fans are still a bit confused by her comeback post.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Spending weeks undergoing inpatient psychiatric treatment can be a challenge.</p>



<p>But, for some patients, returning to normal life can be even more difficult. In a <em>good </em>facility, psychiatric patients sometimes feel a sense of peace and security while under treatment that is difficult to replicate in their everyday lives.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/05/23/amanda-bynes-sad-lonely-life-no-friends-taking-meds-ex-paul-michael/"><em>TMZ </em>reports</a> that Amanda Bynes is currently feeling sad and isolated, more than one month after her release from inpatient care.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former child star Amanda Bynes turned her life around dramatically, furthering her education and working on her mental health.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amanda is currently working to balance her medical needs with the rest of her life, sources close to her report.</p>



<p>In particular, she needs to figure out what to do next.</p>



<p>Right now, Amanda is living alone at her home. However, she does not have a lot of people in her life. Not in person, anyway.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sporting a creative dye job, Amanda Bynes snapped this selfie to share with her fans and followers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Reportedly, Amanda is not able to focus on some of her passions from before her mental health crisis this spring.</p>



<p>She learned a lot about the fashion design and even about being a nail tech.</p>



<p>At the moment, it sounds like these are unable to hold her interest. Those closest to her hope that she will resume those interests in the future &#8212; perhaps when she has better adjusted to day-to-day life.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes is opening up about her painful past. The former child star says her experiences in Hollywood had a lasting impact on her self-esteem.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is of course tough to hear about Amanda struggling to enjoy things that were former passions.</p>



<p>That is not uncommon for someone with mental health struggles &#8212; particularly if someone may have recently had an adjustment in meds or a major episode of some kind.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not all bad news.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this selfie, Amanda Bynes is wearing a light jacket and large glasses. Her lipstick is really vibrant!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amanda is reportedly doing exceptionally well with attending outpatient treatments since leaving the hospital.</p>



<p>That means that she is seeing therapists and taking her medication as directed.</p>



<p>Often, whether someone&#8217;s post-hospitalization recovery is a success story or not depends upon how well they manage their own medical needs.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes&#8217; fans have followed her story for years, including the ups and downs of her mental health. A lot of people continue to root for her.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We mentioned that insiders describe her as being fairly &#8220;alone&#8221; at the moment. But that&#8217;s not always a bad thing &#8212; not compared to certain company.</p>



<p>Reportedly, those closest to her don&#8217;t want to see her reconcile with her ex, Paul Michael.</p>



<p>Paul allegedly wasn&#8217;t there for her during her mental health struggles ahead of her hospitalization. At this point, they believe, it would be best if she just moved on from him. Her recovery might require more stability and support than he can offer.</p>

<p>Wonderful news out of Los Angeles today, as actress Amanda Bynes has been released from the psychiatric facility that had served as her home since late last month.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/amanda-bynes-found-wandering-naked-in-downtown-la-placed-on-5150-psychiatric-hold/">Bynes suffered a breakdown </a>over the weekend of March 18 and was found on Sunday morning wandering the streets of Los Angeles naked.</p>



<p>Amanda was hospitalized under a 5150 psychiatric hold, which was then extended on the advice of medical staff.</p>



<p>However, toward the end of her stint in the facility, Bynes was reportedly receiving inpatient care voluntarily.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes has filed to bring an end to her conservatorship. The former child star has been under her parents&#8217; control for the past nine years.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Medical staff reportedly agreed with Amanda&#8217;s decision that she was ready to leave the facility.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/12/amanda-bynes-ex-fiance-paul-michael-split-before-mental-breakdown/">According to </a>TMZ, Bynes worked with her doctors to coordinate a plan for outpatient care before she checked out of the hospital.</p>



<p>The road to recovery will no doubt be a long one, but those closest to Amanda say she&#8217;s fully committed to the task.</p>

<p>As for what might have triggered Amanda&#8217;s breakdown, while there almost certainly was not a single cause, insiders have indicated that she was coping with the fallout from a messy breakup.</p>



<p>As you may recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/amanda-bynes-fiance-paul-michael-gushes-over-former-child-star-m/">Bynes got engaged to Paul Michael </a>in 2020 after the two of them met in a rehab facility.</p>



<p>Amanda and Paul reportedly called it quits several times in the years that followed, but according to Michael, the most recent breakup was for good.</p>

<p>Michael tells TMZ that he and Bynes broke up about two weeks before her breakdown.</p>



<p>He claims she stormed out of their home and returned three days later with another man.</p>



<p>According to Michael, the two argued, and when Bynes told him to leave, he packed his things and got out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes announced her engagement to Paul Michael on Valentines&#8217; Day, 2020. Three weeks later, they appeared to break it off under parental pressure, but then posted this cozy photo affirming their love. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Michael says that was the last he saw of Amanda.</p>



<p>Though they have not spoken since her hospitalization, Paul says he wishes Amanda all the best.</p>



<p>He claims that in the weeks leading up to her breakdown, Bynes had never seemed happier, and she appeared to be fully devoted to their relationship and her nail care business.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Over the years, Amanda has been admirably candid about her struggles with mental illness and substance abuse.</p>



<p>When the time is right, we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;ll give a full account of this latest setback.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we wish her all the best on her road to recovery.</p>

<p>Late last month, actress <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/amanda-bynes-found-wandering-naked-in-downtown-la-placed-on-5150-psychiatric-hold/">Amanda Bynes was found wandering the streets naked</a> after suffering a mental breakdown.</p>



<p>She was placed on a psychiatric hold and admitted to a mental health facility for treatment and observation.</p>



<p>Such psych holds generally only last for three days, but they can be renewed in cases where hospital staff and the patient&#8217;s family agree that additional treatment is required.</p>



<p>Now, TMZ is <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/09/amanda-bynes-mental-hospital-outpatient-treatment-release/">reporting</a> that three weeks after she was initially admitted, Amanda is still receiving inpatient care at a Los Angeles hospital.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes recently ended her conservatorship. The former child star was under her parents&#8217; control for the past nine years. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The good news is, it appears that Bynes has consented to remain at the facility, even though she is no longer required to do so by a psychiatric hold.</p>



<p>Additionally, insiders say Amanda is aware that she will need to continue with treatment after she is released from the hospital.</p>



<p>Bynes is reportedly working with hospital staff to formulate a plan for outpatient care for when she checks out.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes is back on Instagram. The former actress seems to be doing well, but fans are still a bit confused by her comeback post. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>One optimistic insider says that Amanda might be ready to be released as early as this week.</p>



<p>News of the actress&#8217; latest setback came as a blow to fans, many of whom said they were inspired by the progress that Bynes has shown over the past year.</p>



<p>Amanda spent most of her adult life under a conservatorship controlled by her parents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes is opening up about her painful past. The former child star says her experiences in Hollywood had a lasting impact on her self-esteem. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/amanda-bynes-conservatorship-ends-after-8-years/">Bynes was released from her conservatorship</a> in March of 2022, a move that was fully supported by her family.</p>



<p>Sadly, one year later &#8212; almost to the day &#8212; a naked and frightened Amanda was forced to flag down a car and request a ride to a police station after she became disoriented in downtown LA.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still unclear exactly what happened, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/amanda-bynes-lived-on-the-streets-for-days-before-being-found-medical-personnel-extend-actress-psych-hold/">Bynes might have been living on the streets for several days</a> before she finally found help.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes recently revealed a face tattoo. The reaction to the ink has been overwhelmingly negative, and some fans are concerned for her mental health. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither Amanda nor her loved ones have commented on the events that led up to her hospitalization.</p>



<p>But while we don&#8217;t know much about the situation, the reports that have leaked out have been mostly encouraging.</p>



<p>It sounds like Amanda is on the upswing and will soon be back to a mostly-independent state.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amanda Bynes has joined Instagram and she is showing off her new pink hair and nose ring! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The process will likely be a slow one, but Amanda seems to be surrounded by supportive people, and insiders say she&#8217;s more than willing to put in the work.</p>



<p>We wish her all the best on her road to recovery.</p>
