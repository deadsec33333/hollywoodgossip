<p>Kate Middleton doesn&#8217;t want her children to end up like Prince Harry.</p>



<p>Prince Harry has many good qualities. He is charitable, kind-hearted, has a strong sense of duty, and puts <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-corrects-mindy-kaling-on-how-to-address-her-during-awkward-with-love-meghan-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his wife</a> and children before all else.</p>



<p>But, in one respect, Kate doesn&#8217;t want George, or especially Charlotte or Louis, to be like their uncle.</p>



<p>To that end, a new report claims, Kate is working to make certain that they do not walk in Harry&#8217;s footsteps.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-lessons-has-kate-middleton-learned-from-what-happened-to-prince-harry">What lessons has Kate Middleton learned from what happened to Prince Harry?</h2>



<p>According to a new report by <em><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/kate-middleton-mission-stop-boys-turning-out-like-royal-exile-prince-harry-doesnt-want-history-repeating-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a></em>, Kate Middleton is using her background as a wealthy commoner now that she&#8217;s a royal parent.</p>



<p>Kate married into royalty. Her hope is that her own experiences will allow her to safeguard her children from walking down Prince Harry&#8217;s path.</p>



<p>Prince George is 11. Princess Charlotte is 9. Prince Louis is 7. Kate hopes that all three will grow up with a strong sense of duty, just like Harry. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1024x710.jpg" alt="Prince Harry on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-520638" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-2048x1420.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-960x665.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, Founder and Patron of the Invictus Games Foundation delivers remarks at the Closing Ceremonies of the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images for Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, the report says that she hopes that they will not grow up under the burden of the traditional constraints that come with the monarchy.</p>



<p>Setting that boundary would be much more of a challenge for Prince William. He has only ever known royal life &#8212; and the expectation that he will someday become king <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/king-charles-accused-of-creating-toxic-work-environment-amid-cancer-battle-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like his father</a>.</p>



<p>Though Kate grew up in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kate-middleton-parents-net-worth-family-business-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealthy family</a>, they were still not part of the anachronistic institution into which she has married. That can make a tremendous difference when it comes to raising three royal children to </p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bestselling memoir, <em>Spare</em></a>, Prince Harry writes about feeling like a backup heir to his brother &#8212; and Kate Middleton clearly knows that.</p>



<p>According to the report&#8217;s inside source: &#8220;Although the royal couple embraces tradition, they aren&#8217;t afraid to adapt and step away from strict protocols when the situation calls for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider continued: &#8220;William and Kate are dedicated to their children and prioritize family above all else.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="718" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1024x718.jpg" alt="Prince Harry on November 17, 2024." class="wp-image-520640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-768x538.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-2048x1436.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-960x673.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1080x757.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1200x841.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry during a TV interview during pre-game festivities prior to the start of the 2024 Grey Cup at BC Place on November 17, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rich Lam/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Their approach highlights what’s truly important,&#8221; the source alleged. </p>



<p>The insider continued: &#8220;Giving the kids the freedom to explore their interests and have a childhood that feels as normal as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source then noted: &#8220;A key part of Kate&#8217;s parenting philosophy is ensuring that Prince George, despite being the heir, doesn’t overshadow his siblings.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-report-leaves-something-out">That report leaves something out</h2>



<p>One of the biggest issues for Prince Harry came in adulthood, when he had his own wife and child. </p>



<p>British tabloids penned numerous hate pieces against Meghan Markle (as they continue to do), while he felt like the royal firm offered her up without extending the sorts of pressures and protections that William and Kate received.</p>



<p>We of course cannot verify if any part of <em>RadarOnline</em>&#8216;s report is true. But we hope that William and Kate will ensure that their own children&#8217;s spouses do not become such easy targets.</p>

<p>We have new insight into a feud that continues to rock a nation.</p>



<p>As nearly every celebrity gossip follower knows at this point, the world famous brothers have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/prince-william-prince-harry-funeral-face-off/">not gotten along in quite awhile</a>.</p>



<p>From what we can gather, there&#8217;s been no contact between the siblings in many months.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="709" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1024x709.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520022" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-2048x1418.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-960x665.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1080x748.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1200x831.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William and Prince Harry arrive for the state funeral and burial of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Hannah McKay- WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, meanwhile, Prince Harry and Prince William’s former royal aide, Jason Knauf, is opening up about his rare insider perspective on the brothers’ years-long rift.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all very sad, really.</p>



<p>“It’s very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye,” Knauf &#8212; who worked as a communication secretary for the brothers and their wives &#8212; said during a interview with 60 Minutes Australia on Sunday, February 23. </p>



<p>“But [William]’s chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same.”</p>

<p>Neither William nor Harry has said anything to the press about their relationship.</p>



<p>But Knauf admits &#8220;it’s been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them.”</p>



<p>Jason worked as a communications secretary to William and his wife, Princess Kate Middleton, as well as to Harry and <em>his</em> wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a>&#8230; before transitioning to the role of chief executive of William and Kate’s Royal Foundation in March 2019. </p>



<p>He knows both brothers rather well.</p>



<p>Although he stepped down from the royal household at the end of 2021, Knauf remains on the board of trustees for Prince William’s Earthshot Prize.</p>

<p>When it comes to Harry and Markle, Jason said he worked “closely” with the former Royals and had “lots of great times.” He even referred to their 2018 wedding as an “amazing, magical experience.”</p>



<p>At some point, of course, Prince William will become king.</p>



<p>Is it possible such a monumental occasion will bring the siblings back together?</p>



<p>&#8220;I can’t speculate about the future. They achieved a lot together, and none of that can ever be taken away,&#8221; Knauf simply said on this topic.</p>



<p>No, but William was allegedly not very receptive to his loved one dating Markle&#8230; which kicked off their feud back in 2018.</p>

<p>In the pages of his recent biography, Harry even accused William of physically assaulting him during an argument over the actress in 2019. </p>



<p>The father of two explained he got into an argument with his brother after William called Meghan “difficult,” “rude” and “abrasive,&#8221; adding in the book:</p>



<p>“He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor,” Harry wrote about the altercation. </p>



<p>“I landed on the dog’s bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.”</p>

<p>Despite everything that the royal family has put Harry and his wife through, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/prince-harry-to-the-royal-family-take-me-back-i-can-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry is willing to help</a> during his father’s health crisis, as King Charles has cancer &#8212; that would include helping with royal duties in some capacity, if that’s what they need.</p>



<p>William, however, is staunchly against this.</p>



<p>“There’s one huge obstacle in Harry’s way, and that’s Prince William,” a royal expert, Kinsey Schofield, said in February.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/prince-william-blocking-prince-harry-royal-return-king-charles/">Harry will not be allowed to return</a> in any capacity if Prince William has any influence over the situation.”<br></p>

<p>Have Meghan Markle and Prince Harry been snubbed by the Clooneys?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-tailor-comes-forward-with-final-word-on-infamous-wedding-dress-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry&#8217;s 2018 wedding</a> was the social event of the year, with A-list stars and dignitaries from across the globe in attendance.</p>



<p>Among the celebrities on hand were George and Amal Clooney, who had developed a close friendship with the Sussexes in the months after they announced their engagement.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the two couples have drifted apart in recent years.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the fact that they now live on separate continents, or maybe there was some sort of secret falling out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-vs-the-clooneys">Harry and Meghan vs. the Clooneys</h2>



<p>For unknown reasons, the Clooneys allegedly failed to invite Harry and Meghan to the third annual Albie Awards.</p>



<p>The Clooney Foundation for Justice in New York City hosted the star-studded event in September of 2024.</p>



<p>George and Amal left the couple off the guest list despite the fact that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/prince-harry-prince-williams-nyc-run-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry was in Manhattan</a> that week to attend the Clinton Global Initiative Summit. In other words, he easily could&#8217;ve attended.</p>

<p></p>



<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that this was the second straight year the duke and duchess were MIA at the event.</p>



<p>Sources say the Sussexes were stunned when the Clooneys didn&#8217;t invite them to the star-studded soiree in 2023.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the snubs they&#8217;ve had to deal with since their move to Hollywood, this is probably the most hurtful [to Harry and Meghan],&#8221; one insider told the <em>National Enquirer</em> (<a href="https://radaronline.com/p/prince-harry-meghan-markle-humiliated-snubbed-george-amal-gala/">via</a> Radar Online). </p>

<p>&#8220;George and Amal went from being their wedding guests and trusted confidants to totally ghosting them.&#8221;</p>



<p>As an actress, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-was-humiliated-by-spotify-firing-insider-claims/">Meghan likely encountered her fair share of rejection</a>, but this sort of snub is probably new to Harry.</p>



<p>And it seems that the Sussexes are not taking it well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-left-reeling">Harry and Meghan Left Reeling</h2>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge kick in the teeth and a massive embarrassment they can&#8217;t really explain or wrap their heads around,&#8221; the insider added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The gala would have been a dream event for the two, but George and Amal knew only too well the circus that follows them would have ruined it for others.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, the first snub came at a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-is-strategizing-her-hollywood-reinvention-with-a-new-pr-team-is-the-duchess-getting-desperate-for-a-comeback/">Harry and Meghan were attempting to rebuild their public image</a> following a string of bad press.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-483640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1680320928-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex meet with NATO Joint Force Command and families from Italy and Netherlands during day five of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 14, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Being spotted at an A-list charity event would&#8217;ve provided exactly the sort of boost that Harry and Meghan needed to help them reclaim their place at the top of the global celebrity totem pole.</p>



<p>The situation comes as a shock, as the Clooneys previously spoke quite highly of the Sussexes.</p>



<p>&#8220;We live not too far from one another and we have dinners and stuff and we&#8217;re friends with them for all the reasons that you&#8217;re friends with anybody,&#8221; George told the <em>Daily Mail</em> in 2020.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just really nice, fun, kind people, they&#8217;re a very loving couple, and they&#8217;re going to be great parents.&#8221;</p>



<p>We may never know exactly what caused the two couples to drift apart.</p>



<p>But with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/george-clooney-divorce-actor-and-wife-living-separate-lives-source-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce rumors circulating around George and Amal</a>, the Clooneys might have decided to shrink their social circle in an effort to sidestep unnecessary drama.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s possible that as UK residents, George and Amal have decided that their loyalty lies with the Windsors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Attention, Kate Middleton!</p>



<p>Anything you can do, Meghan Markle can do better. And hotter. And with even more intimacy and love and passion.</p>



<p>This is the message we can&#8217;t help but wonder if the former actress is now sending&#8230; considering the just posted a photo on Instagram of her and husband Prince Harry locking lips.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/meghan-markle-prince-harry-021425-d639b8610e254b76a43caccbae2c58a9.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-519294" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/meghan-markle-prince-harry-021425-d639b8610e254b76a43caccbae2c58a9.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/meghan-markle-prince-harry-021425-d639b8610e254b76a43caccbae2c58a9-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day 2025 from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Meghan Markle/Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Markle just happened to do so around the same exact time as Middleton just <em>happened</em> to release a similarly cute/romantic <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-go-full-on-pda-in-rare-valentines-day-photo/">picture of her and husband Prince William</a>.</p>



<p>(Granted, both women also did so around the same exact time as Valentine&#8217;s Day on the calendar. But just go with us here, okay?)</p>



<p>Does this mean Markle is trying to reignite her infamous feud with Middleton?</p>



<p>Last we heard, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-ends-feud-with-meghan-markle-prince-harry/">Middleton had reached out to her one-time enemy</a> amid the devastating Los Angeles wildfires this winter in an attempt to check in on her well-being and perhaps to bury the hatchet.</p>



<p>Now, though? It&#8217;s hard to say whether or not Markle was throwing some shade at the Princess of Wales with this similar snapshot.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-2048x1370.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-960x642.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1200x803.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, arrives for The Paley Center for Media gala honoring actor and director Tyler Perry, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills on December 4, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT / AFP) (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For her part, Middleton included just a red heart emoji as a caption to the aforementioned photo (below) of her and her spouse.</p>



<p>Again, maybe in an attempt to show Kate up, Meghan took her social media message a lot further.</p>



<p>&#8220;Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine, as he continues on at the Invictus Games, changing lives and reminding all of us of the power of healing and resilience through these incredible veterans and their families. Beyond proud of my husband and what he’s created,&#8221; she wrote, referring to Harry doing some charitable work these days in Canada.</p>



<p>Added Markle:</p>



<p><strong>My love, I will eat burgers &amp; fries and fish &amp; chips with you forever. Thank you for you.</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this week, observers <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-leaves-invictus-games-without-prince-harry-whats-going-on-here/">were wondering just why Markle left</a> the aforementioned Invictus Games without Harry, prompting a new round of romantic speculation about the couple.</p>



<p>The pair <em>did</em> kick off the event together, attending the opening ceremony and numerous events during the first days of the adaptive sporting competition for service personnel and veterans that the Duke of Sussex founded in 2014.</p>



<p>It seemed evident now that Markle just went back to California early to care for the couple&#8217;s two children.</p>



<p>Said Harry to People Magazine during the Invictus Games, making it clear just where things stood between himself and the former Suits cast member: </p>



<p>&#8220;To have my wife here supporting me is amazing. I love that she’s by my side. It’s such an important piece to this whole adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Harry took a subtle shot at Donald Trump over the weekend.</p>



<p>While making a speech to open the Invictus Games in Canada, the handsome Royal didn&#8217;t mention America&#8217;s 47th President of the United States by name.</p>



<p>However, Harry did cite the events competitors and said their “courage, values and humanity” deserved special respect at a time “when there is no shortage of crises, no absence of uncertainty, no lack of weak moral character in the world.”</p>

<p>Typically, members of the Harry&#8217;s infamous family avoid <em>all</em> mentions of global affairs &#8230; lest they risk being seen to interfere in politics, something his late grandmother went far out of her way to avoid at all times,</p>



<p>Granted, of course, Harry is estranged from most of his alleged loved ones.</p>



<p>In general, Harry&#8217;s comments were met by cheers from a crowd in Vancouver, as he also said early in his greeting that we are “in [a] moment of difficulty and division&#8221; and gathered &#8220;here in a spirit of unity.&#8221;</p>



<p>One need not read too sharply between the lines to understand that Harry was referring here to Trump &#8212; who, in his first couple weeks as President, has threatened a war with numerous countries&#8230; blamed Democrats for a fatal plane crash&#8230; and gotten rid of as many DEI initiatives as possible across the nation.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth remembering that Trump isn&#8217;t exactly a big fan of Prince Harry.</p>



<p>A constant (and very mean) critic of the Prince, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/donald-trump-prince-harry-deport/">Trump previously said he planned to deport Harry</a> back to the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>When asked again late last week if he still had this plan, Trump told The New York Post of Harry and Meghan Markle: </p>



<p>“I don’t want to do that. I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”</p>

<p>In Harry&#8217;s memoir, Spare, Harry wrote about the time he got high on mushrooms at Friends star Courteney Cox’s house&#8230; and also revealed that he had snorted cocaine at age 17 “to feel different.”</p>



<p>Speaking to Nigel Farage in a GB News interview last year, Trump (who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/donald-trump-says-kate-middleton-is-doing-well-king-charles-is-fighting/">gets along well with Prince William</a>) said the following about Harry&#8217;s immigration status after these bombshells were dropped in the book: </p>



<p>“We’ll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they’ll have to take appropriate action.”</p>



<p>This feud dates to a 2016 Comedy Central panel show in which Markle &#8212; then an actress and not yet dating Harry &#8212; made her contempt for Trump well known, labeling him “misogynistic” and “divisive,” and joking that she might move to Canada if Trump was elected president.</p>



<p>He has, of course, been elected president on <em>two</em> occasions now.</p>

<p>In 2022, Trump told fellow <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> hater Piers Morgan: </p>



<p>“Harry is whipped like no person I think I’ve ever seen.” </p>



<p>He then predicted the couple would divorce, stating:</p>



<p> “It’ll end, and it’ll end bad… I want to know what’s going to happen when Harry decides he’s had enough of being bossed around… Or maybe when she decides that she likes some other guy better. I want to know what’s going to happen when it ends, okay?”</p>

<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/prince-harry-meghan-markle-christmas-holidays-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry shared their Christmas card</a> with the world.</p>



<p>And because it&#8217;s 2024 &#8212; a time when even holiday greetings are divisive &#8212; the photo they used has sparked numerous controversies.</p>



<p>The card featured six photos of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex engaged in various wholesome activities.</p>

<p>We see them putting in public appearances, greeting supporters, and generally behaving like respectable American royals.</p>



<p>But because the haters felt the need to maximize their creepiness, the pic that&#8217;s getting the most attention is the one that shows Harry and Meghan embracing their two children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-markle-photoshop-allegations">Meghan Markle Photoshop Allegations</h2>



<p>Conspiracy theorists are convinced that Meghan and Harry &#8212; though Meghan seems to be receiving the bulk of the allegations &#8212; have doctored the photo.</p>



<p>The commentary on social media ranges from typical Photoshop accusations to claims that Harry and Meghan &#8220;rent[ed] a kid for the holidays.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prince Harry &amp; Meghan’s Christmas card ! ???????? <a href="https://t.co/Wi5ZvdQJtG">pic.twitter.com/Wi5ZvdQJtG</a></p>— Iris ????

<p>That quote was one of many compiled by <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14201209/Harry-Meghan-holiday-card-sparks-wild-conspiracy-theories.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, who documented some of the more bonkers theories about the Sussexes&#8217; card.</p>



<p>Many of the wildest allegations came from an X (formerly Twitter) user who identified herself as &#8220;a royal historian.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Meghan’s arm is twice as long as a normal arm. The black dog has 3 legs and a strange shimmering edge to his body,&#8221; this alleged historian wrote. And the list went on from there:</p>

<p>&#8220;Archie went from dark auburn hair to dead straight ginger hair. Meghan’s feet face forward but her torso is side on. Both kids are exactly the same height despite a two-year age difference.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many X users alleged that the Sussexes intentionally used a low-resolution photo in order to hide inconsistencies.</p>



<p>But as the <em>Mail</em> notes, the photo was one of six featured in a grid, so it makes sense that it looks a bit blurry when magnified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Archie hasn&#8217;t grown in two years and is the same size as his younger sister… What is this garbage?&#8221; one user asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who thought this scene with such OBVIOUS staging was a good idea?&#8221; another alleged.</p>



<p>The <em>Mail</em> consulted with a Photoshop expert named James Middleton (no relation to Kate) who said that the size of the photo makes it difficult to determine if it&#8217;s been altered.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 at Merkur Spiel-Arena on September 16, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany." class="wp-image-515332" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1685001474-5-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 at Merkur Spiel-Arena on September 16, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;It is going to be very hard to work out the authenticity,&#8221; James told the outlet, adding that it&#8217;s &#8220;far too small&#8221; to analyze in the same way that he and others assessed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-family-portrait-removed-by-news-agencies-due-to-alleged-editing-wth-is-going-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Middleton&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day photo</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s certainly possible that Harry and Meghan touched up the photo before making it public.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not an uncommon practice nowadays, even among non-celebrities.</p>



<p>Fortunately, most of us have the freedom to slap a filter on our profile pics without incurring the wrath of thousands of weird strangers.</p>

<p>Prince William has opened up about his family&#8217;s plans for Christmas.</p>



<p>And while the party will definitely be a well-attended affair with a guest list of 45, it looks as though certain close relatives still are not invited.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, William paid a visit to some active-duty soldiers and their families.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-william-gets-candid-about-christmas">Prince William Gets Candid About Christmas</h2>



<p>Asked how he and his loved ones will be spending the holidays, William offered up some specifics:</p>



<p>“We’ll be in Norfolk, at Sandringham,” he told the families, according to <em><a href="https://people.com/prince-william-reveals-rare-details-royal-family-christmas-plans-8761255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>. “We’ll be 45 for Christmas. It won’t be quiet, it will be noisy.”</p>



<p>Sandringham is the country estate that belongs to King Charles and Queen Camilla.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188613162-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince William, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief, 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment, visits the Regiment for a Christmas event for families at Picton Barracks on December 10, 2024 in Bulford, Wiltshire.

<p></p>



<p>The royals have spent every Christmas there since 1988.</p>



<p>Obviously, William didn&#8217;t proceed to rattle off the names of all 45 guests. </p>



<p>But multiple sources have already confirmed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/prince-harry-meghan-markle-invited-uk-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have not been invited</a> to Sandringham.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-tradition-of-exclusion">A Tradition of Exclusion</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="673" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1422607768-7-1024x673.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex on the long Walk at Windsor Castle arrive to view flowers and tributes to HM Queen Elizabeth on September 10, 2022 in Windsor, England.

<p>That&#8217;s no great surprise, as Meghan and Harry have not joined the royals&#8217; Christmas celebrations since 2018, the year they got married.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve known for some time that the Sussexes have not been on speaking terms with William since the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s memoir.</a></p>



<p>But the holiday situation reminds us that the bad blood is even older than that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince William, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief, 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment, visits the Regiment for a Christmas event for families at Picton Barracks on December 10, 2024 in Bulford, Wiltshire." class="wp-image-515201" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612913-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief, 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment, visits the Regiment for a Christmas event for families at Picton Barracks on December 10, 2024 in Bulford, Wiltshire.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Richard Pohle &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-william-flies-solo">William Flies Solo </h2>



<p>William arrived at this week&#8217;s event on his own, which was not unexpected.</p>



<p>His wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kate-middleton-will-continue-to-limit-stress-following-chemotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Middleton, has returned to public life</a> after completing cancer treatment in September.</p>



<p>But doctors have reportedly advised the Princess of Wales to maintain a less strenuous work schedule and continue to prioritize her health.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince William, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief, 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment, hands out small presents to the children of serving soldiers during a visit to the Regiment for a Christmas event for families at Picton Barracks on December 10, 2024 in Bulford, Wiltshire." class="wp-image-515199" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188618832-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief, 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment, hands out small presents to the children of serving soldiers during a visit to the Regiment for a Christmas event for families at Picton Barracks on December 10, 2024 in Bulford, Wiltshire.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Richard Pohle &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The future king and queen were both in attendance at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/king-charles-warns-prince-william-not-to-neglect-marriage-to-kate-middleton-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate&#8217;s annual Christmas concert</a> last week, but that might be the last time we see Kate until Christmas church services.</p>



<p>As for Meghan and Harry&#8217;s holiday plans, no announcements have been made, but it&#8217;s expected that the couple will enjoy a low-key celebration with their two children at their home in Santa Barbara.</p>



<p>Harry&#8217;s probably missing some aspects of royal life, but we&#8217;re guessing that putting on a show for the cameras every holiday season isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

<p>But you wouldn&#8217;t know it from the couple&#8217;s recent activities.</p>



<p>Yes, given that they executive produced the series and they both appear on camera in small cameo roles, you might expect that Harry and Meghan would be working hard to promote <em>Polo</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, they seem to be distancing themselves from the project, which might be a smart move considering the ice-cold reception <em>Polo</em> has received thus far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polo-stumbles-out-of-the-gate">&#8216;Polo&#8217; Stumbles Out of the Gate</h2>



<p>As a glorified reality show (the &#8220;docuseries&#8221; label is quite a stretch here), the show has been mostly ignored by critics.</p>



<p>In fact, only one review &#8212; a two-out-of-five rating from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/10/polo-review-prince-harry-netflix-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a></em> &#8212; is linked on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s clattering and niche, and feels like a spoof documentary designed to play on screens in the background of episodes of <em>Succession</em>,&#8221; writes the outlet&#8217;s Stuart Heritage. Ouch.</p>



<p>“The critics have universally slammed the show. Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Of course everyone is running away from it, in every direction, so to as to not pick up the stench of this colossal bomb,&#8221; marketing expert Tony Case tells <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/even-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-want-nothing-to-do-with-their-terrible-new-show-about-polo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Beast</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;From a brand perspective, I’m not really sure anything can be done at this point to reverse consumers’ obvious apathy toward the Sussexes,&#8221; Case adds.</p>

<p>&#8220;They set out to conquer America, but nobody here, it turned out, found them or what they’re peddling to be particularly compelling.”</p>



<p>The outlet describes <em>Polo</em> as &#8220;a reality TV-style take on polo that’s been compared to <em>Selling Sunset</em> and The <em>Real Housewives</em> franchise, just without the ratings.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-s-latest-misstep">Harry and Meghan&#8217;s Latest Misstep</h2>



<p>This is the latest in a long line of PR setbacks for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Signs of the couple&#8217;s plummeting popularity Stateside began earlier this year when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-was-humiliated-by-spotify-firing-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s Spotify podcast was canceled</a> after just one season.</p>



<p>One source tells <em><a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/celebrity/news/meghan-markle-prince-harry-polo-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closer</a></em> magazine that Harry and Meghan lost control of their latest project to Netflix bosses who wanted a soapy reality show, and not a thought-provoking doc about a little-understood subculture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry and Meghan are putting on a brave face and saying it’s a good bit of fun and ultimately not something to get worked up about,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p>&#8220;As far as they’re concerned it’s very unfair they’re catching heat, they take issue with people who roll their eyes and call them reality TV sellouts.</p>



<p>“Meghan knows it doesn’t really matter how she and Harry feel about it, perception is everything and now online forums are burning up with people ridiculing them,” the source adds.</p>

<p>“Truth is, it was pretty much out of their control,” they continued. “The bosses wanted the series to appeal to the masses and pushed this reality TV slant so it’s not entirely their fault.”</p>



<p>The Beast also notes that Prince William may have subtly <a href="https://x.com/NetflixUK/status/1866854481968705847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1866854481968705847%7Ctwgr%5E2624719ffd482f8d69be7fad8dd26694d1e6927f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Feven-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-want-nothing-to-do-with-their-terrible-new-show-about-polo%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trolled Harry and Meghan </a>by revealing that he&#8217;s addicted to a different Netflix show &#8212; the Keira Knightley spy thriller<em> Black Doves</em>.</p>



<p>This is a worst-case scenario for Harry and Meghan, who were in desperate need of a hit following a year of bad press and failed projects.</p>

<p>Prince Harry might be feeling uneasy following news that Prince William met with Donald Trump over the weekend.</p>



<p>William and Trump were both in France for the reopening of the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral, which was badly damaged by fire in 2019.</p>



<p>The pair met and spoke for about 30 minutes, and while Harry&#8217;s name might not have come up at all, experts believe the younger prince is watching the situation closely.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-s-deportation-drama">Prince Harry&#8217;s Deportation Drama</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security demanding the release of the Duke of Sussex&#8217;s visa records. </p>



<p>The group alleges that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/courteney-cox-prince-harry-tripped-on-mushrooms-at-my-house-and-he-did-not-have-my-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s admission of drug use</a> in his 2023 memoir, <em>Spare</em>, should make him a candidate for deportation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/donald-trump-prince-harry-deport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump has been critical of Harry and Meghan Markle</a> in the past, and he once stated outright that he would &#8220;not protect&#8221; the couple from being deported.</p>

<p>The subject probably didn&#8217;t come up during Trump and William&#8217;s brief meeting, but we&#8217;re guessing the sit-down still made Harry uncomfortable.</p>



<p>One royal expert believes that while Trump and William probably didn&#8217;t bond over their shared animosity for Harry, there&#8217;s still cause for the Duke of Sussex to be anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know there&#8217;s an issue supposedly with what might or might not be on the application form for Prince Harry&#8217;s US visa. He mentioned that he&#8217;d taken drugs in <em>Spare</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>One anonymous insider believes that Harry and Meghan are likely &#8220;fearful&#8221; of being targeted once Trump takes office in January,</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe they are very scared &#8212; especially since Meghan has talked badly about Trump, and I have read, seen and heard that she is very upset over the election results,&#8221; the source tells <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/inside-haggard-prince-harrys-us-visa-panic-trump-has-him-hit-list-he-meghan-very-scared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do think they are fearful, especially because of what Harry admitted in his memoir.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider even goes so far as to suggest that Harry and Meghan&#8217;s latest real estate deal was inspired by their concerns about Trump.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe they bought this house in Portugal because of Trump in case they need another place to go if the American government deports Harry. An escape plan, if you will,&#8221; says the source.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-praises-prince-william">Trump Praises Prince William</h2>



<p>As for Trump&#8217;s impression of Prince William, it seems that the president-elect was quite taken with the future king.</p>



<p>“He’s a good-looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night,” Trump told <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/08/world-news/trump-gushes-over-very-handsome-prince-william-after-paris-meeting-some-people-look-better-in-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em> after their meeting.</p>

<p>“Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that,” he added.</p>



<p>Trump went on to reveal that he asked William about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/kate-middleton-prince-william-more-in-love-than-ever-following-cancer-battle-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Middleton, who battled cancer</a> this year.</p>



<p>“I asked him about his wife and he said she’s doing well. And I asked him about his father and his father is fighting very hard, and he loves his father and he loves his wife, so it was sad,” Trump said.</p>



<p>“We had a great talk for half an hour, a little more than half an hour. We had a great, great talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad to hear the meeting went smoothly. As anyone who&#8217;s seen <em>Love Actually</em> knows, pre-Christmas encounters between British and American leaders can easily go awry.</p>

<p>On December 4, the Duke of Sussex took to the stage in New York City to join <em>New York Times</em> columnist and CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin for a wide-ranging conversation about the mainstream media, misinformation, and efforts to make the digital world a safer place.</p>



<p>But all the headlines in the aftermath of this sit-down are focused on speculation over Harry&#8217;s marriage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-speaks-out-on-divorce-rumors">Prince Harry Speaks Out on Divorce Rumors</h2>



<p>&#8220;I Google Newsed you, and there were people fascinated by everything you&#8217;re doing, all the time. They&#8217;re fascinated by Meghan is in California right now, and you&#8217;re here,&#8221; Sorkin said to the Royal. </p>



<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s articles left and right about, you know, &#8216;Why are you making, doing independent events? Why aren&#8217;t you doing them together?'&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true.</p>



<p>Folks are always wondering why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/meghan-markle-hints-at-more-solo-appearances-after-thanksgiving-event-without-harry/">Markle isn&#8217;t always with Harry</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently we&#8217;ve bought or moved house 10, 12 times. We&#8217;ve apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it&#8217;s just like, what?&#8217; &#8221; Prince Harry said with a laugh in response to Sorkin.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to keep up with, but that&#8217;s why you just sort of ignore it. The people I feel most sorry about are the trolls,&#8221; he continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;Their hopes are just built and built, and it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,&#8217; and then it doesn&#8217;t happen. So I feel sorry for them. Genuinely, I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, as recently as six weeks ago, gossip outlets were labeling <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/meghan-markle-prince-harry-toxic-marriage-report/">Markle and Harry&#8217;s marriage as toxic</a> and likely to end in divorce.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sussexes-new-life">The Sussexes&#8217; New Life </h2>



<p>Harry and Meghan share kids Archie Harrison, 5, and Lilibet Diana, 3.</p>



<p>The former previously revealed he’s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-excluded-from-royals-christmas-plans-for-sixth-straight-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesitant to travel back to his native country</a> with the Duchess of Sussex due to the British tabloid media’s coverage of the spouses.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s still dangerous,” Harry said in an interview with ITV in July. &#8220;And all it takes is one lone actor, one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read.”</p>



<p>Harry, of course, lost his mother as a child when the car Princess Diana was in crashed while speeding away from the paparazzi.</p>



<p>In this new Q&amp;A, Harry &#8220;I very much enjoy living here and bringing up my kids here,&#8221; referring to the United States and the activities he can do here with his children that he “undoubtedly wouldn’t be able to do in the U.K.&#8221;</p>



<p>Concluding on this topic &#8212; the freedom he has with his son and daughter &#8212; and citing his late parent, Harry said on Wednesday:</p>



<p>&#8220;I never thought I was going to live, and it feels as though it’s the life that my mom wanted for me.&#8221;</p>
