<p>Some are calling into question Hilaria Baldwin and her pregnant belly photos from over the years.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right &#8212; it&#8217;s no longer just about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/hilaria-baldwin-accent-spain-boston-the-baldwins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her accent</a>.</p>



<p>The<em> <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/alec-baldwin-ptsd-rust-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldwins</a></em> star shares seven children with Alec Baldwin, and is stepmother to his eldest daughter, Ireland.</p>



<p>Officially, Hilaria welcomed just one of her children via surrogate. But some ask if that is the <em>whole </em>truth.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Alec Baldwin and Hilaria Baldwin and their children on The Baldwins." class="wp-image-517888" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_05-Cropped.png 1665w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On &#8216;The Baldwins,&#8217; Alec Baldwin and Hilaria Baldwin and their kids walk down the sidewalk.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-s-a-new-fan-theory-about-hilaria-baldwin">There&#8217;s a new &#8216;fan&#8217; theory about Hilaria Baldwin</h2>



<p>As you can see below, some on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1iwbzud/each_of_hilaria_baldwin_pregnancies_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> and elsewhere on social media are questioning whether Hilaria Baldwin&#8217;s pregnancy photos look <em>quite right</em>.</p>



<p>In a post labeled &#8220;Each of Hilaria Baldwin&#8217;s &#8216;pregnancies&#8217; in chronological order,&#8221; a slideshow of photos shows Hilaria looking very different.</p>



<p>This is not only because she looked different over all in 2013 than she did in 2022. It is because she seems to carry the pregnancies so differently that people are openly questioning whether she was even pregnant for some of these. For <em>most </em>of these.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1iwbzud/each_of_hilaria_baldwin_pregnancies_in/
</div></figure>



<p>From the looks of things, no one questions whether Hilaria Baldwin was truly pregnant with Carmen back in 2013.</p>



<p>Similarly, everyone freely acknowledges that Maria Lucia Victoria, born in February 2021, was welcomed via surrogate. (These speculators have a theory as to why Hilaria and Alec divulged Lucia&#8217;s surrogacy)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all of the children in between &#8212; and the child they&#8217;ve welcomed since &#8212; that the public is scrutinizing.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-1024x576.png" alt="Hilaria Baldwin speaks to the confessional camera on The Baldwins." class="wp-image-517886" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_03.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Though it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the franchise that she wanted, &#8216;The Baldwins&#8217; has made Hilaria Baldwin into a reality TV star. Of sorts.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-different-about-hilaria-baldwin-s-pregnancy-photos">What is different about Hilaria Baldwin&#8217;s pregnancy photos?</h2>



<p>As you can see in the social media slideshow above, Hilaria&#8217;s pregnancy photos &#8212; with the sole exception of Carmen &#8212; look unusual.</p>



<p>There is absolutely such a thing as &#8220;basketball pregnancies.&#8221; Some people are very skinny, and their pregnancies are practically invisible from behind. As if they were smuggling basketballs under their shirts.</p>



<p>But, as numerous commenters pointed out, Hilaria does not appear to have secondary signs of pregnancy as she did with Carmen. No weight gain in her limbs and no visible changes in her breast tissue. These are changes that would normally be very conspicuous on such a slender, petite woman.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Alec Baldwin, Hilaria Baldwin, and children in the kitchen on The Baldwins." class="wp-image-517884" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_01-Cropped.png 1660w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In the first teaser trailer for The Baldwins, we see Alec Baldwin, wife HIlaria Baldwin, in a seemingly staged cake decorating moment with several of their children.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As to the theory which we hesitate to label a conspiracy theory &#8230; it&#8217;s a claim that Hilaria, for whatever reason, stopped giving birth herself after Carmen. </p>



<p>The theory also says that they kept all but one of the subsequent births via surrogate (more specifically, a gestational carrier) a secret.</p>



<p>That would be an <em>extremely </em>odd thing to do. Many people &#8212; especially wealthy celebrities &#8212; welcome children via surrogate. But Alec and Hilaria are deeply odd people. You don&#8217;t usually get your own TLC show if you&#8217;re normal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-reveal-that-lucia-was-born-via-surrogate">Why reveal that Lucia was born via surrogate?</h2>



<p>Alec and Hilaria welcomed Maria Lucia Victoria on February 25, 2021. That was just five months and some change after the birth of Eduardo &#8220;Edu&#8221; Pao Lucas on September 8, 2020.</p>



<p>Physicians advise waiting around two years between pregnancies. Giving birth five months apart would either be medically impossible or a medical emergency. So the fan theory is that Hilaria &#8220;had&#8221; to admit that Lucia was a surrogacy in order to explain the back-to-back births of her fifth and sixth children.</p>



<p>We have to of course emphasize that Hilaria could simply be someone who looks so slender during most of her pregnancies that she <em>looks </em>like she&#8217;s wearing a prosthetic baby bump. And that perhaps she and Alec decided to have a child via surrogate at a time that overlapped with a natural pregnancy.</p>



<p>It <em>is </em>possible. After all, as we acknowledged, Hilaria is known for her eccentricities.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin is very much in the <em>Rust </em>trailer, in case you were wondering how they&#8217;d handle that.</p>



<p>More than three years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/alec-baldwin-im-not-responsible-for-halyna-hutchins-death-if-i-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tragedy</a> struck the set of the Western film. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins lost her life.</p>



<p>Now, the trailer is out.</p>



<p>Watch the <em>Rust </em>teaser for yourself. A sense of unease permeates every moment &#8212; at least, if you know what happened.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1024x576.png" alt="Alec Baldwins on 'The Baldwins' during the series premiere." class="wp-image-520049" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the premiere episode of &#8216;The Baldwins,&#8217; Alec Baldwin had clearly seen happier times.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rust-trailer-is-out">The &#8216;Rust&#8217; trailer is out</h2>



<p>As you can see below, the <em>Rust </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6q3scsTwg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> is full of Western vistas, horses, tension, death, and old-timey shootouts.</p>



<p>Yes, some of it feels uncomfortably close to the tragedy that befell that film set.</p>



<p>And yes, Alec Baldwin takes center stage in multiple scenes in the trailer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The film follows 13-year-old orphan, Lucas Hollister, who accidentally kills a Kansas rancher. He then has to go on the run with his grandfather, an aging outlaw who reemerges to protect the boy.</p>

<p>Notably, the Rust credits honor the late Halyna Hutchins as cinematographer. </p>



<p>After her death, Bianca Cline stepped into the cinematographer role. Those were big shoes to fill.</p>



<p>Additionally, Halyna Hutchins&#8217; husband &#8212; now widower &#8212; Matthew Hutchins appears as Executive Producer. </p>

<p>Throughout the trailer, there is a palpable discomfort &#8212; and it has nothing to do with the trailer itself, which promises tension, violence, and warm moments.</p>



<p>But the rest of us are aware of the tragedy of Hutchins&#8217; death.</p>



<p>The world at large also knows of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/alec-baldwin-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious prosecutor</a> who seemed determined to put Alec Baldwin in prison over the senseless accident &#8212; so determined, it seems, that she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-shooting-trial-dismissed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sabotaged her own case</a>.

<p><em>Rust </em>will hit theaters on May 2. There were, for obvious reasons, multiple delays.</p>



<p>The film has already premiered at the Camerimage Film Festival in Poland. The reviews seem to be fairly positive.</p>



<p>But the dismissal of Baldwin&#8217;s manslaughter charges did not undo <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/alec-baldwin-ptsd-rust-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his trauma</a>. Similarly, the specter of what took place on set hangs over the trailer for <em>Rust</em>. It&#8217;s unclear what sort of public reception the film will receive.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin has an <em>infamous </em>temper. It has gotten him into trouble and tainted his personal brand more than once.</p>



<p>This time, a camera caught him making a pretty graphic threat towards an &#8220;ambush comedian&#8221;</p>



<p>To top it all off, this time, Baldwin wasn&#8217;t the one impersonating <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/philadelphia-eagles-alleged-snub-of-donald-trump-sparks-anger-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p>As the self-styled comedian taunted Baldwin about the tragic death of Halyna Hutchins, the actor clapped back. Did he go too far?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alec-baldwin-did-not-enjoy-being-ambushed-taunted-about-a-horrific-accident">Alec Baldwin did not enjoy being ambushed, taunted about a horrific accident</h2>



<p>The <em>Rust </em>tragedy <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/alec-baldwin-ptsd-rust-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Alec Baldwin traumatized</a> &#8212; and put him through months and months of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/alec-baldwin-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legally dubious prosecution</a>.</p>



<p>All of that and more was emotional baggage that the actor was carrying around with him when the ambush took place.</p>



<p>On Monday, February 24, &#8220;comedian&#8221; Jason Scoop uploaded an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGdh7Qrp-S1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> video in which he harassed Baldwin while dressed as Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin is clearly just dealing with some luggage at his car when this goes down.</p>



<p>“It’s your favorite president,” Scoop taunts while doing a passable impersonation of the current occupant of the Oval Office. “Look, Alec, I will offer you a total pardon, because I want to be friends, right? I want to be friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Scoop then continues: &#8220;I will give you a total pardon for murdering that woman if you kiss the ring.&#8221;</p>



<p>No one murdered Halyna Hutchins. A series of safeguards all failed. Ultimately, this meant that Baldwin&#8217;s gun on the set of <em>Rust</em> went off, fatally wounding Hutchins and hospitalizing another.</p>

<p>As Scoop continues, he pushes his hand towards Alec Baldwin. &#8220;Kiss the ring, Alec,&#8221; he demands while the actor does his best to ignore the obnoxious behavior.</p>



<p>“Alec, if you don’t want that pardon for murdering that woman in cold blood, you can call it first degree, you can call it whatever you want, but it was not good,&#8221; the vile bit continued. </p>



<p>Scoop added: &#8220;She’s looking down on me right now, smiling, happy. ‘Thank you for confronting the man who took me out, who killed me.’”</p>

<p>“You got a camera on me here?” Alec Baldwin finally asks, after the verbal assault has gone on for what feels like ages.</p>



<p>“You realize my kids live in this building?&#8221; he says confrontationally, looking Scoop in the eye. &#8220;I want you to know something. I want you to be real careful.&#8221;</p>



<p>Baldwin then adds: &#8220;If this camera wasn’t here, I’d snap your f&#8211;king neck in half and break your f&#8211;king neck right here. You know that, don’t you?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-want-you-to-get-out-of-here">&#8216;I want you to get out of here&#8217;</h2>



<p>This Instagram clown, whom Baldwin told to leave before he decides to &#8220;shove that camera up your a&#8211;,&#8221; is not the first to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/piers-morgan-alec-baldwin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taunt Baldwin over this tragedy</a>. And he will not be the last.</p>



<p>Tasteless provocateurs are a dime a dozen, and will say or do any cruel thing for attention. Additionally, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/alec-baldwins-snl-comeback-leaves-viewers-divided-was-it-too-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldwin&#8217;s Trump skits on <em>SNL</em></a><em> </em>seemed to enrage a lot of very weird, very unkind people.</p>



<p><em>Many </em>people have extremely valid criticisms of Alec Baldwin. They may even involve his conduct on the day of Halyna Hutchins&#8217; tragic death. But this display was not okay.</p>

<p>Taunting Baldwin and slandering him as a &#8220;murderer&#8221; for clicks is not acceptable behavior. </p>



<p>Without endorsing his violent threat, we can safely say that many people might have said the same as Baldwin did &#8212; or worse &#8212; in his position.</p>



<p>Fortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no neck vertebrae were harmed in the making of that awful little internet video.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin has PTSD following the tragic <em>Rust </em>shooting.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/alec-baldwin-trailer-the-baldwins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Baldwins</em> finally premiering</a>, the world is getting a glimpse into him at a time when he&#8217;s processing it all.</p>



<p>When this filmed, Baldwin did not know whether he would be in prison for the premiere. (He is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-shooting-trial-dismissed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decidedly not</a>)</p>



<p>More significantly, he felt haunted &#8212; and, obviously, traumatized &#8212; by the horror of Halyna Hutchins&#8217; death.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alec-baldwin-is-processing-his-trauma-on-the-baldwins">Alec Baldwin is processing his trauma on &#8216;The Baldwins&#8217;</h2>



<p>On the February 23 series premiere of <em>The Baldwins</em>, <em><a href="https://people.com/alec-baldwin-asks-why-couldnt-it-have-been-me-after-fatal-rust-shooting-11683821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> </em>reports, Alec Baldwin shares his diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder following the <em>Rust </em>tragedy.</p>



<p>“He was diagnosed with PTSD,&#8221; Hilaria shares during the first episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;And he says in his darkest moments, ‘If an accident had to have happened this day, why am I still here? Why couldn’t it have been me?&#8217;” she describes. That kind of survivor&#8217;s guilt is extremely common.</p>

<p>Addressing husband Alec, Hilaria Baldwin details: “You wake up in the morning and you’re like, ‘Oh god, why did I wake up?&#8217;”</p>



<p>It turns out that she&#8217;s not exaggerating. Baldwin has struggled to explain his mental and emotional state to friends, but he has tried.</p>



<p>“I said, ‘I’m happier when I’m asleep than when I’m awake,&#8217;” he admits.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alec-baldwin-is-in-a-state-of-disbelief">Alec Baldwin is in a state of disbelief</h2>



<p>During the<em> The Baldwins</em> premiere, Alec Baldwin describes the experience as &#8220;surreal.&#8221;</p>



<p>To Hilaria, Baldwin remarks: “I can’t even believe that we’re going through this.” That state of disbelief during a period of prolonged trauma is also pretty normal &#8212; and must have been worsened by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/alec-baldwin-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trial</a>.</p>



<p>“I always feel more in pain about you than me,&#8221; Baldwin explains to Hilaria. &#8220;Because I think to myself, well, you know, I’m going to try to my best to just get through it, and I think what it’s done to you and how much it’s hurt you and everything.”</p>

<p>“This past year was just terrible,” Alec Baldwin then remarks in a confessional segment.</p>



<p>“There were times I’d lay in bed, I’d go, ‘Wow, my kids. I can’t get up,'&#8221; he characterized.</p>



<p>Baldwin clarified: &#8220;That’s not like me. I’m not like that at all, not in any way am I like that. Never.”</p>

<p>“I look at the kids, and I see how hard we’re trying to create happy for them, even if we’re masking stuff for ourselves,” Hilaria explained.</p>



<p>“I know that what we’re going through is maybe unique,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;But every family goes through hard times, and that’s something that we can feel a community of support.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hilaria continued: &#8220;Knowing that the best that we can do is do our best and try to make our kids happy, and so that’s what we’re doing.”</p>

<p>At this point, Baldwin chimes in to agree with his wife. </p>



<p>“Honestly, from the bottom of my soul, I don’t know where I’d be if I didn’t have you and these kids going through this,&#8221; he admits. &#8220;I never would have made it with this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Baldwin adds: &#8220;Sometimes I’d say, ‘Why did I have seven kids? Why do we have seven kids?’ And I realize, to help carry me and you through this situation.”</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin&#8217;s unexpected <em>SNL</em> comeback received a very mixed reaction from fans of the iconic sketch show.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, a judge recently decided to drop <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-shooting-trial-dismissed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldwin&#8217;s involuntary manslaughter charges</a> stemming from the 2021 shooting death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of the movie <em>Rust</em>.</p>



<p>As Hutchins&#8217; family mourns the three-year anniversary of that tragedy, the decision to drop the charges against Baldwin remains a source of controversy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alec-baldwin-s-snl-comeback-sparks-controversy">Alec Baldwin&#8217;s &#8216;SNL&#8217; Comeback Sparks Controversy</h2>



<p>Prior to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-lawyer-rust-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rust</em> shooting</a>, Baldwin spent several years portraying Donald Trump in <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketches.</p>



<p>After a long hiatus, Baldwin returned to the show for this week&#8217;s cold open.</p>



<p>He did not, however, reprise his role as Trump. Instead, Baldwin played Fox News journalist Bret Baier, who interviewed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kamala-harris-michael-jackson-disinformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> earlier in the week.</p>

</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The political content of the sketch was relatively tame. But the opening generated major controversy due to the inclusion of Baldwin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-snl-viewers-express-confusion-over-baldwin-s-return">&#8216;SNL&#8217; Viewers Express Confusion Over Baldwin&#8217;s Return</h2>



<p>&#8220;Why is Alec Baldwin back on SNL?&#8221; one person tweeted, according to <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/12713022/alec-baldwin-snl-comeback-manslaughter-charges-rust-shooting-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can honestly say I wasn’t expecting Alec Baldwin,&#8221; another added. </p>



<p>&#8220;SNL bringing Alec Baldwin back was really gross,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>

<p>But Baldwin seemed to have more defenders than detractors. On X (formerly Twitter) and elswhere, many defended the decision to bring him back to the show.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry people can’t seem to grasp the fact that Alec Baldwin has moved on from his troubles, and just continued to just be the man that he is today — one with a huge heart for so many out there, and his family,&#8221; wrote one viewer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Quit b&#8211;ching about him coming back to the #SNL spotlight,&#8221; another added.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these salty comments asking why Alec Baldwin is &#8216;allowed&#8217; on #SNL,&#8221; a third observed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice to see Alec Baldwin back on SNL. Opening skit was fantastic!&#8221; a fourth viewer opined.</p>



<p>Baldwin&#8217;s presence might have overshadowed the content of the sketch in which he appeared. But ultimately, it seems that most viewers approved of the return, and we&#8217;re sure there are no regrets about the decision to bring him back.</p>

<p>In the weeks after his trial came to an abrupt conclusion, the future of Baldwin&#8217;s career seemed uncertain.</p>



<p>Recently, there&#8217;s been talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/alec-baldwin-reality-show-hilaria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec and wife Hilaria Baldwin starring in a reality show with their seven kids</a>. Barring any unforeseen obstacles, the series will debut on TLC sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>The <em>SNL</em> appearance is signficant, as it indicates that Baldwin intends to return to acting, despite rumors to the contrary.</p>



<p>What happened on the set of <em>Rust</em> was, of course, a horrible tragedy. But it was also an accident. And Alec Baldwin and his family should be permitted to move on with their lives.</p>

<p>Are Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin not returning for <em>Beetlejuice 2</em>?</p>



<p>Ever since Warner Bros. Pictures released the trailer for the sequel, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>, fans have been digging for spoilers. Considering that the original film is about old enough to start a presidential campaign, we all knew that the sequel would be different.</p>



<p>But Geena Davis and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/alec-baldwin-celebrates-after-rust-shooting-charges-dropped-but-hes-not-out-of-the-woods-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ever-controversial Alec Baldwin</a> were both memorable, central characters to the first film.</p>



<p>Why is there no sign of them in the <em>Beetlejuice </em>sequel? To be honest, it just would&#8217;ve been impossible. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beetlejuice-beetlejuice-alec-baldwin-and-geena-davis-don-t-return-because-tim-burton-didn-t-want-them-to">&#8216;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&#8217;: Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis Don&#8217;t Return Because Tim Burton Didn&#8217;t Want Them To</h2>



<p><em>Beetlejuice </em>was an instant, memorable hit in 1988. </p>



<p>Though many younger Millennial viewers may better remember the animated series (in which the titular character was more of a rascal best friend than an antagonist), the film left a mark upon popular culture. Many of its stars remain beloved acting icons to this day.</p>



<p>In the original, Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin portray a pair of ghosts. The couple haunt and ultimately befriend the living family that moves into their home &#8212; particularly the daughter, Lydia. Winona Ryder of course portrays Lydia.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="BEETLEJUICE BEETLEJUICE | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoZqL9N6Rx4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As you can see from the trailer that Warner Bros. Pictures dropped on Thursday, May 23, the sequel film is clearly a blast from the past and many of the the OG stars are back, including Catherine O&#8217;Hara and Michael Keaton as the titular star. </p>



<p>But Geena Davis is also alive and working on both television and film. And even if one were to ignore <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/alec-baldwin-was-on-camera-when-he-learned-that-halyna-hutchins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec Baldwin&#8217;s most infamous recent film</a>, he, too, is alive and working. Yet there&#8217;s no sign of them in the trailer or in any other materials related to the sequel.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s just how director and creator Tim Burton wanted it. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think the thing was for me I didn&#8217;t want to just tick any boxes. So even though they were such an amazing integral part of the first one, I was focusing on something else,&#8221; Burton explained in an interview before the film&#8217;s release.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-alec-amp-geena-got-the-axe-from-beetlejuice-sequel">Why Alec &amp; Geena Got The Axe From &#8216;Beetlejuice&#8217; Sequel </h2>



<p>&#8220;A sequel like this, it really had to do with the time, Burton added.  </p>



<p>That was my hook into it, the three generations of mother, daughter, granddaughter. And that [would] be the nucleus of it. I couldn&#8217;t have made this personally back in 1989 or whatever.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Geena Davis in April of 2024." class="wp-image-500636" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_geenadavis_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Geena Davis, recipient of the Viola Davis Trailblazer Award, attends the CinemaCon Big Screen Achievement Awards on April 11, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for CinemaCon)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the original film, Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin portray Barbara and Adam Maitland (respectively). The two die at the start of the film, becoming ghosts residing in their home.</p>



<p>When the Deetz family moves in, they first attempt to frighten away the family. Later, they recruit the titular Beetlejuice &#8212; a trickster demon &#8212; in the hopes of evicting the living from their home.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the two become surrogate parents to the living family&#8217;s daughter, Lydia. The famous sequence of her flying at the end is a little indulgence from her ghostly pals.</p>



<p>Tim Burton helmed that film and this one. The movie clearly has enough money to add new (legendary) actors like Willem Dafoe and Danny DeVito. </p>



<p>Not to mention Jenna Ortega, who will seemingly be the one summoning Beetlejuice this time around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-geena-davis-weighs-in-on-beetlejuice-sequel">Geena Davis Weighs In On Beetlejuice Sequel</h2>



<p>Before Tim cleared the air as to why the stars weren&#8217;t invited back, there were two prevailing explanations for why we wouldn&#8217;t not see Davis or Baldwin appear at all in <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>.</p>



<p>The first possibility felt personal. If, for example, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/alec-baldwin-formally-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-connection-with-rust-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec Baldwin&#8217;s recent drama</a> (an understatement) made the studio wary of controversy.</p>



<p>But the second and more irritating, was the reality of actors aging 35 years when ghosts clearly should not. A creative team can address that &#8212; as <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> did with Q &#8212; but it&#8217;s an obstacle. Michael Keaton&#8217;s character looked like a busted clown in 1988 and will look the same in 2024, so it&#8217;s not a problem for him at all.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where Geena comes in. </p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m not in the remake,&#8221; Davis revealed to <a href="https://www.etonline.com/geena-davis-confirms-shes-not-in-the-beetlejuice-sequel-heres-why-exclusive-223341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>ET</em></a> when asked about the sequel. </p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you were expecting that I would be? Yeah, no, you know what? Because my theory is that ghosts don&#8217;t age&#8230; Not that I have,&#8221; she added with a laugh.</p>



<p>But you know what? With all that said, even if they don&#8217;t show up in the film, we would suspect that something will come of their story still.  We&#8217;re sure that the absence of their ghostly characters will get an explanation.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin has a high-priced lawyer. More than one, actually. And looks like he&#8217;s going to need them. </p>



<p>Despite some previous good news for him, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/alec-baldwin-celebrates-after-rust-shooting-charges-dropped-but-hes-not-out-of-the-woods-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec Baldwin is not yet in the clear</a> in the <em>Rust</em> shooting case.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-shooting-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldwin&#8217;s shooting trial</a> is underway, beginning with voir dire before (optimistically) Wednesday&#8217;s opening statements.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the embattled actor may be paying a tremendous amount for his defense.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alec-baldwin-is-on-trial-for-the-accidental-rust-shooting-death-of-halyna-hutchins">Alec Baldwin is on trial for the accidental &#8216;Rust&#8217; shooting death of Halyna Hutchins</h2>



<p>In 2021, Alec Baldwin was holding a prop gun while filming <em>Rust </em>in New Mexico. The gun discharged, resulting in injury to director Joel Souza and the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.</p>



<p>Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection to her death. He has stated that he did not pull the trigger or know that the gun contained live ammo.</p>



<p>If he receives a conviction, he faces up to 18 months in prison.</p>

<p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed worked as the armorer on <em>Rust</em>, and was thus in charge of all of the prop weapons on set. Her defense argued that she became a scapegoat for issues beyond her control.</p>



<p>In March, she received a conviction for involuntary manslaughter over Hutchins&#8217; tragic death. She is serving an 18-month sentence while appealing.</p>



<p>The judge has denied her immunity to testify, meaning that she will be unable to answer certain questions as a witness at Baldwin&#8217;s trial without potentially incriminating herself. And, of course, that the court cannot compel her to answer certain questions (thank you, Fifth Amendment).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-for-the-trial-alec-baldwin-hired-two-high-powered-lawyers">For the trial, Alec Baldwin hired two high-powered lawyers</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/alec-baldwin-was-on-camera-when-he-learned-that-halyna-hutchins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec Baldwin learned of Hutchins&#8217; death</a> during a police interrogation &#8230; after what appears to have been an extensive &#8220;conversation.&#8221; Withholding information to get someone talking on the record is not an uncommon tactic.</p>



<p>Baldwin could have used a lawyer with him at the time to keep this tactic from being effective.</p>



<p>For the trial, he&#8217;s not making the same mistake. He has hired two prominent attorneys: Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-luke-nikas-is-one-of-alec-baldwin-s-lawyers">Luke Nikas is one of Alec Baldwin&#8217;s lawyers</h2>



<p>Nikas is a Harvard Law School graduate and a partner in one of the world&#8217;s largest law firms.</p>



<p>When authorities first announced the charges against Alec Baldwin, Nikas declared that this was a miscarraige of justice.</p>



<p>Nikas&#8217; legal history includes defending former gallery director Ann Freedman in an <a href="https://apnews.com/national-national-general-news-b23bb3481399401ab76b3f9d5dd93512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous art forgery case</a> in New York.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alex-spiro-is-also-representing-alec-baldwin-at-the-rust-accidental-death-trial">Alex Spiro is also representing Alec Baldwin at the &#8216;Rust&#8217; accidental death trial</h2>



<p>Like Nikas, Alex Spiro is a Harvard graduate. And both are partners at Quinn, Emanual, Urquhart &amp; Sullivan.</p>



<p>Spiro&#8217;s work focuses upon government enforcement cases, and if his name sounds familiar, it should. The former Manhattan prosecutor&#8217;s name comes up a lot in entertainment litigation and celebrity cases.</p>



<p>Over the years, he&#8217;s provided legal representation for people as beloved as Jay-Z and as reviled as Elon Musk. Alec Baldwin is &#8230; somewhere between the two on the spectrum of public opinion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin in August of 2023." class="wp-image-503524" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">American actor Alec Baldwin looks on during the Women&#8217;s Singles First Round match between Coco Gauff of the United States and Laura Siegemund of Germany on Day One of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on August 28, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-alec-baldwin-paying-his-lawyer">How much is Alec Baldwin paying his lawyer?</h2>



<p>Notably, Alex Spiro does not come cheap. At least, not always. In 2023, he represented entrepreneur Charlie Javice as the founder of the student loan company, Frank, faced charges of fraud and conspiracy.</p>



<p>According to <em>People</em>, <a href="https://people.com/alec-baldwin-attorney-rust-charged-2025-dollars-hour-fee-8675129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a> from that case showed that Spiro charged Javice $2,025 per hour to represent her.</p>



<p>That is an expensive lawyer, even by legal standards. Ultimately, Javice did not have to pay &#8212; in 2023, a court ruled that JP Morgan (who had brought suit against her) had to cover her hefty attorney fees.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin in December of 2023." class="wp-image-503525" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_alecbaldwin_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alec Baldwin speaks onstage during the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights&#8217; 2023 Ripple of Hope Gala on December 06, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just to be clear, there are no indications that Alec Baldwin is paying his lawyer that much. While a defense like this costs a pretty penny, we don&#8217;t know Alex Spiro or Luke Nikas&#8217; rates for Baldwin.</p>



<p>(Spiro once charged New York Mayor Eric Adams a mere $250 per billable hour to represent him during a sexual harassment lawsuit)</p>



<p>No matter the rate, this will be expensive. It&#8217;s unclear if the new <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/alec-baldwin-reality-show-hilaria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldwin reality series</a> is paying enough to make up the difference.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin is getting his own reality show alongside his wife, Hilaria.</p>



<p>Considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/hilaria-baldwin-campaigning-for-role-on-real-housewives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hilaria Baldwin&#8217;s obvious interest in reality TV stardom</a>, this is not a huge surprise. But the timing is&#8230;odd.</p>



<p>TLC is launching <em>The Baldwins</em> (though this working title may be subject to change) in 2025.</p>



<p>The series will follow the controversial actor, his wife, and their chaotic home. Assuming of course, he&#8217;ll be home to participate. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hilaria-and-alec-baldwin-set-to-become-reality-stars">Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Set to Become Reality Stars</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, June 4, both Alec and Hilaria Baldwin took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7zLlVbOKuO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to announce their upcoming reality TV show.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, the announcement is filled with two main elements.</p>



<p>The first is a causal, off-the-cuff vibe from Hilaria and Alec Baldwin. And the second is endless family chaos.</p>

<p>In the seemingly off-the-cuff and improvised video, the Baldwins introduce followers to their 2025 reality series.</p>



<p>“We’re inviting you into our home to experience the ups and downs; the good, the bad, the wild and the crazy,” Alec Baldwin says during the video.</p>



<p>He then declares that “Home is the place we love to be most.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hilaria-and-alec-baldwin-have-seven-children">Hilaria and Alec Baldwin have seven children</h2>



<p>During the video, we see a montage of the couple&#8217;s seven shared children acting like, well, children. They&#8217;re excited, they run around, they make noise, they sound overwhelmed.</p>



<p>Their eldest, Carmen, is 10. Their youngest, Ilaria, is all of 19 months.</p>



<p>Playing the comically overwhelmed parent, Alec tells the camera: “We are the Baldwins, and we’re going to TLC! God help you all.”</p>

<p><em>Variety </em>reported on <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/alec-baldwin-hilaria-reality-series-tlc-the-baldwins-1236024828/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TLC&#8217;s official blurb</a> on the reality series, which has a tentative title of <em>The Baldwins</em>. By 2025, it could have a different name altogether.</p>



<p>“Alec and Hilaria Baldwin have been making headlines since they were married nearly 12 years ago. In this TLC follow-doc series, Alec and Hilaria invite viewers into the home they share with their seven growing kids,&#8221; the network pitches.</p>



<p>TLC then teases: &#8220;For the first time, they’re opening up their family lives and bringing everyone in to join in the nonstop love, laughter and drama.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-now-a-good-time-for-an-alec-baldwin-reality-show">Is now a good time for an Alec Baldwin reality show?</h2>



<p>On social media, some are already speculating that this reality TV series may be an effort to pivot attention away from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/alec-baldwin-celebrates-after-rust-shooting-charges-dropped-but-hes-not-out-of-the-woods-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Rust </em>shooting</a>. Even dropped charges can stick in the minds of the public.</p>



<p>That tragedy&#8217;s primary consequence was, of course, the senseless death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the gunshot injury of director Joel Souza. But for Alec Baldwin, personally, this has also been a hit to his brand <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/alec-baldwin-geena-davis-beetlejuice-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and his career</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the series could provide a new public image when it comes Alec Baldwin. Or, at the very least, give people something else to discuss &#8212; even if it isn&#8217;t positive.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-683x1024.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin and Hilaria Baldwin in early November of 2023." class="wp-image-501234" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0604_alecbaldwin_03-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alec Baldwin and Hilaria Baldwin attend Glamour Women of the Year 2023 at Jazz at Lincoln Center on November 07, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Glamour)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As we noted when Alec Baldwin was in celebration mode following dropped <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/alec-baldwin-formally-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-connection-with-rust-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charges</a>, he&#8217;s not yet in the clear. He&#8217;s still facing charges this summer for involuntary manslaughter. </p>



<p>According to a <em>People </em>report in early June, New Mexico prosecutors seek to have armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed <a href="https://people.com/prosecutors-alec-baldwin-rust-case-armorer-testify-trial-8657811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testify against Baldwin</a>. Though he has maintained that he had no idea that the gun was loaded and that he did not pull the trigger, the state hopes to find him legally culpable for manslaughter.</p>



<p>He could, in theory, face up to 18 months behind bars if convicted. Which, by our math, says that it&#8217;s possible that The Baldwins could see a 2025 premiere while one of its cast members is behind bars. So &#8230; that&#8217;s awkward.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-maybe-this-is-about-something-a-lot-simpler-than-a-deadly-tragedy">But maybe this is about something a lot simpler than a deadly tragedy</h2>



<p>Of course, reports from just a couple of months before this announcement said that HIlaria Baldwin was eager to become a reality TV star.</p>



<p>Specifically, there were claims that she hoped to join the <em>Real Housewives</em> franchise. Clearly, that has not worked for her.</p>



<p>Becoming a Bravolebrity is a dream for a lot of would-be Housewives. Some believe that Alec Baldwin pushed to make this happen as a half-measure. Yes, the two are <em>slumming it </em>with TLC, but it could be worse. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/duggar-family-reality-tv-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It <em>could </em>be WEtv</a>.</p>

<p>Hilaria Baldwin is reportedly fighting for a role on Bravo&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</em>.</p>



<p>The timing is a little odd, as Hilaria&#8217;s husband, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/alec-baldwin-formally-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-connection-with-rust-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec Baldwin, will soon stand trial</a> on involuntary manslaughter charges stemming from the accidental shooting of Halyna Hutchins that took place in 2021 on the set of the film <em>Rust</em>.</p>



<p>But despite &#8212; or perhaps because of &#8212; the drama in her family life, Hilaria is looking to branch out into the world of reality television.</p>



<p>And it seems she has the support of at least one well-known Housewife.</p>

<p>According to a new report from<em> <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/alec-baldwins-wife-hilaria-positions-herself-to-become-next-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-star/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>,</em> Kyle Richards is assisting Hilaria in her campaign to join Bravo&#8217;s most famous franchise.</p>



<p>The only problem is that Hilaria lives in New York, but she&#8217;s hoping to become a Beverly Hills Housewife.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1447259728-1024x682.jpg" alt="Hilaria Baldwin and Alec Baldwin attend the 2022 Robert F.

<p>Despite possible geographic disqualifiers, Kyle thinks that her friend would be the ideal replacement for Annemarie Wiley, who was recently dismissed from the cast.</p>



<p>According to Radar, when the issue of the show&#8217;s residency requirement was broached during a recent conversation, Richards remarked, &#8220;She lives in New York, but maybe she would move.&#8221;</p>

<p>For several years now, Hilaria and Alec have been floating the idea of a reality show centering around their sizable family.</p>



<p>(The couple has seven children together,)</p>



<p>But it seems that Hilaria has decided to switch up her strategy in light of her husband&#8217;s recent legal troubles.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1245427370-1024x693.jpg" alt="Hilaria Baldwin and Alec Baldwin arrive at the 2022 Robert F.

Kennedy Human Rights Ripple of Hope Award Gala at the Hilton Midtown in New York on December 6, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Hilaria is terrified of losing all the attention she&#8217;s gained as the wife of a Hollywood star if he&#8217;s away in prison,&#8221; an insider dished to the National Enquirer. &#8220;This would be the perfect fit.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s probably no real cause for concern on that front.</p>



<p>For starters, it&#8217;s unlikely that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/alec-baldwin-prison-charges-involuntary-manslaughter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alec will go to prison</a>, as it&#8217;s been well established that Hutchins&#8217; death was an accident, and the star who pulled the trigger was merely performing the actions that were called for in the script.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="836" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1233603646-836x1024.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin and wife Hilaria Baldwin attend DreamWorks Animation's &quot;The Boss Baby: Family Business&quot; premiere at SVA Theatre on June 22, 2021 in New York City.

<p>On top of that, if Alec <em>does</em> get locked up, it likely won&#8217;t be for very long.</p>



<p>And lack of attention from the media is probably not a problem that Hilaria will experience during that time.</p>



<p>Still, we can see why the mom of seven might want to line up some new revenue streams.</p>



<p>When she married a wealthy movie star, she probably imagined that she was set for &#8212; but these days, Hilaria&#8217;s future is looking mighty uncertain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Early this year, prosecutors <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/alec-baldwin-formally-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-in-connection-with-rust-shooting/">formally charged Alec Baldwin with manslaughter</a> following the tragic <em>Rust </em>shooting.</p>



<p>The mishap was the result of a confluence of mistakes that should never, ever have happened. No one should die to make a movie. </p>



<p>Additionally, public reactions showed clear influence from politics &#8212; and from Alec being personally unlikable. He was controversial even <em>before </em>he held a prop gun that killed a beloved cinematographer and wounded the director.</p>



<p>Now, authorities have dropped the charges (for now). Alec is breathing a sigh of relief, and thanking a couple of people in particular.</p>

<p>On Thursday, April 20, Alec Baldwin&#8217;s attorneys released a statement, reporting that the New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney&#8217;s Office had dropped both counts of involuntary manslaughter charges against their client.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&nbsp;are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin,&#8221; his attorneys expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; their statement continued, &#8220;we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taking to social media to somberly celebrate good news, Alec Baldwin shared this extremely low resolution photo of him and Hilaria Baldwin. (Photo Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alec Baldwin posted a somewhat low-key acknowledgment. That is understandable; it is difficult to celebrate news, even positive news, under the circumstances.</p>



<p>&#8220;I owe everything I have to this woman,&#8221; Alec Baldwin wrote alongside a jarringly low resolution photo of him with his wife, Hilaria Baldwin.</p>



<p>He also offered an addition: &#8220;(and to you, Luke).&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8220;I owe everything to this woman,&#8221; Alec Baldwin declared on his Instagram caption in April. He also offered a shoutout to his attorney. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In another context, that addition in Alec Baldwin&#8217;s caption might make it appear that he is part of a throuple.</p>



<p>However, he was referring to Luke Nikas &#8212; one of his attorneys in this case.</p>



<p>Thanking your wife and your attorney is definitely a classy move in the wake of such a complex, ugly, and profoundly tragic series of events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On her own page, Hilaria Baldwin shared this photo of herself with husband Alec Baldwin after the couple received some positive, yet somber, news. (Photo Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alec&#8217;s wife, Hilaria, offered a much less 2006-cell-phone-camera looking photo of the two of them in a post of her own on Thursday.</p>



<p>Her caption was much simpler &#8212; an elegant, tasteful <em>red heart</em> emoji.</p>



<p>And the photo itself showed her curled up on her husband&#8217;s lap. A sweet moment of marital comfort. Their lives have been in turmoil for some time. Not the greatest tragedy in all of this, but it&#8217;s not <em>nothing</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis <a href="https://www.etonline.com/alec-baldwin-says-he-owes-everything-to-wife-hilaria-and-his-lawyer-after-rust-charges-dropped">opened up to <em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a> in a statement, explaining the decision to drop the charges.</p>



<p>&#8220;Over the last few days and in preparation for the May 3, 2023, preliminary hearing,&#8221; the statement began.</p>



<p>The prosecutors explained that &#8220;new facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis in the case against Alexander &#8216;Alec&#8217; Rae Baldwin, III.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A police recording showed Alec Baldwin&#8217;s interrogation following the Rust shooting. The video showed exactly how police kept the conversation going until the actor provided all of the details that they wanted, only then revealing that the cinematographer had died.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Consequently, we cannot proceed under the current time constraints,&#8221; the statement reasoned. </p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; prosecutors then added, &#8220;on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form.&#8221;</p>
