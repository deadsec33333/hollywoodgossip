<p>Is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/lebron-james/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron James</a> planning to retire from the NBA?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a question that&#8217;s on the minds of many basketball fans as the living legend approaches a crossroads in his career.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re likely aware, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/simone-biles-biological-mother/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Summer Olympics</a> will kick off today with an opening ceremony in Paris.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lebron-james-at-the-olympics-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with">LeBron James at the Olympics: A Force to Be Reckoned With</h2>



<p>Now, LeBron has been a dominant force on the team since his first Olympics back in 2004.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s earned three medals with the team &#8212; one bronze and two golds &#8212; and he&#8217;s hoping to cap off his career as an olympiad by bringing home the gold one last time.</p>



<p>Yes, at 39, it&#8217;s not <em>impossible</em> that LeBron will return for the 2028 games in Los Angeles. But it&#8217;s highly unlikely.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="654" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163181955-1024x654.jpg" alt="LeBron James of The United States looks on during the 2024 USA Basketball Showcase match between USA and Germany at The O2 Arena on July 22, 2024 in London, England.

<p>Of course, these days, your average Angeleno is probably concerned with a more immediate question.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-lebron-james-planning-to-retire-from-the-nba">Is LeBron James Planning to Retire From the NBA?</h2>



<p>Back in April, LeBron&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/lebron-james-becomes-nbas-all-time-scoring-leader-breaks-kareem-abdul-jabbars-38-year-old-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Lakers</a> were eliminated from the NBA playoffs following a loss to the Denver Nuggets.</p>



<p>At the time, many fans speculated that the basketball legend might decide to call it quits.</p>



<p>LeBron addressed the matter with a non-committal tweet:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="745" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162191552-1024x745.jpg" alt="LeBron James of USA scores a basket during the 2024 USA Basketball Showcase match between USA and South Sudan at The O2 Arena on July 20, 2024 in London, England.

<p>&#8220;I’ve seen, heard a lot of reports about my future. I said it last night and I’ll say it again. I do not know yet as I’m only thinking about spending time with my family &amp; friends!&#8221; he wrote on X (formerly Twitter), adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;When I know after speaking with the fam, my counsel as well as my representation about it then you guys will know. Until then [hushing emoji]. Love.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not the kind of statement that&#8217;s likely to ease the minds of Lakers fans.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they&#8217;re likely to get at least one more season from LeBron for one simple reason &#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bronny-era-is-just-beginning">The Bronny Era Is Just Beginning</h2>



<p>Last month, the Lakers drafter Lebron&#8217;s 19-year-old son, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/lebron-james-son-no-show-paris-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bronny James</a>.</p>



<p>LeBron has spoken at length about his lifelong goal of playing in an NBA game with his eldest child. </p>



<p>And you can be certain that he&#8217;s not about to give up now, with the dream so close to coming true.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-1024x683.jpg" alt="LeBron James of Team United States trains during the Basketball training session ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games on July 24, 2024 in Lille, France." class="wp-image-504814" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163497315-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">LeBron James of Team United States trains during the Basketball training session ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games on July 24, 2024 in Lille, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So we can be fairly certain that LeBron James will <em>not</em> retire ahead of the NBA season that starts in October.</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re a fan of King James, you&#8217;ll want to make sure to catch his upcoming performance in Paris.</p>



<p>It&#8217;ll probably be the last time that you get to see him in a Team USA uniform.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/simone-biles-biological-mother/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Paris Olympics</a> get underway, all-star athletes from all over the world will display their athletic prowess.</p>

Yes &#8212; though it is not the focus of the Summer Olympics, basketball has been an official Olympic sport since 1936.</p>



<p>While LeBron aims to bring home another gold medal, where is Bronny?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bronny-james-son-of-lebron-james-has-his-own-basketball-career">Bronny James, son of LeBron James, has his own basketball career</h2>



<p>19-year-old Bronny James has been playing as part of the NBA Summer League.</p>



<p>He scored 13 points for the Los Angeles Lakers, a basketball team, while facing off against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday, July 18.</p>



<p>LeBron James, his famous father, was overseas with Team USA. However, despite the 11-hour time difference from the game, he was able to tune in. He&#8217;s been able to watch when Team USA isn&#8217;t practicing.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a family, obviously we&#8217;re just proud of the fact that he&#8217;s even at this point,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5647108/2024/07/19/lebron-james-bronny-nba-summer-league-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron expressed</a> the next day, <em>The New York Times</em> reported.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t matter if he plays well, it doesn’t matter if he doesn’t play well,” he emphasized.</p>



<p>That may be an allusion to Bronny having had some weaker games earlier in the summer league games.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bronny-james-will-show-improvement-with-practice-his-father-says">Bronny James will show improvement with practice, his father says</h2>



<p>“I mean, he’s 19 years old, so he has so much room to grow,” LeBron affirmed. “He has so much more to learn, but the best thing, he just keeps his head down and just stays focused.&#8221;</p>



<p>The basketball legend then predicted: “So the best will continue to come as he continues to work and continues to get better and better.”</p>



<p>With some exceptions, that tends to be how things go. Bronny has a lot to prove if he wants to step out of LeBron&#8217;s shadow, but his father clearly believes in him.</p>

<p>Of course, Bronny&#8217;s basketball career means that he won&#8217;t be able to root for his father in person.</p>



<p>(To be fair, LeBron&#8217;s means the same. He can watch his son from afar, if the timing is right.)</p>



<p>LeBron James is representing the United States of America at the 2024 <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/simone-biles-retiring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="47">Paris Olympics</a>. He is an absolute legend in the world of basketball.</p>

<p>Bronny James is focusing on his career, which is clearly exactly what his family and loved ones hope for.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, LeBron is aiming for his third gold medal. This will be his fourth Olympics game overall.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s certainly not the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/hezly-rivera-meet-the-youngest-u-s-olympian-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">youngest Olympian</a> in the games, but he has the athletic prowess and the experience to help bring the team to victory.</p>

<p>Among NBA obsessives, the debate over which legendary player is the league&#8217;s true GOAT will continue to rage for many years to come.</p>



<p>But in the third quarter of a 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday night, LeBron James made a powerful argument for why he&#8217;s the greatest to ever take the court.</p>



<p>With a simple fadeaway jumper that never would have made the game&#8217;s highlight reel under normal circumstances, LeBron earned his 38,387th career point, making him the league&#8217;s all-time leading scorer.</p>



<p>Laker legend Kareem Abdul Jabbar broke Wilt Chamberlain&#8217;s previous record back in 1984 (the year LeBron was born).</p>

<p>By the time he retired five years later, Jabbar had seemingly put the record out of reach for future generations.</p>



<p>But as he&#8217;s done so many times in his life, James once again achieved the impossible last night.</p>



<p>In front of a star-studded crowd that included celebrity well-wishers such as Usher and Jay-Z, LeBron set a record that&#8217;s likely to stand for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I write &#8216;The Man In The Arena&#8217; on my shoe every single night from Theodore Roosevelt,&#8221; James said in a press conference after the game. </p>



<p>&#8220;Tonight, I actually felt like I was sitting on top of the arena when that shot went in, and the roar from the crowd. I&#8217;m not sure if I would be able to feel that feeling again, unless it&#8217;s a game-winning Finals shot.&#8221;</p>



<p>LeBron said the occasion enabled him to share an unprecedented moment with his wife, mother, and children, all of whom were in attendance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything just stopped. It gave me an opportunity to embrace it and look around and seeing my family, the fans, my friends. It was pretty cool,&#8221; James said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I probably can count on my hands how many times I have cried in 20 years, either in happiness or in defeat. So that moment was one of them when I kind of teared up a little bit,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>Obviously, LeBron has experienced just about every sort of success imaginable over the course of his legendary career.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/11/lebron-james-to-joe-biden-im-coming-to-the-white-house-lets-get/">James has led teams to four NBA championships</a>; he&#8217;s been crowned league MVP four times, and he has two Olympic gold medals shining in his trophy case.</p>



<p>But clearly, last night&#8217;s achievement was one that will most stand out to James when he reflects on his years as arguably the world&#8217;s most dominant athlete.</p>

<p>It was a moment enhanced by the presence of James&#8217; loved ones, as well as his respect for the living legend who set the record so long ago.</p>



<p>And it was a moment that will live forever in the memories of basketball fans all over the world &#8212; even if they still can&#8217;t agree on who the GOAT is.</p>

<p><a href="/2020/11/donald-trump-finally-admits-joe-biden-won-the-election/">Joe Biden has been elected President of the United States</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Donald Trump and his Republican cronies are simply running a (very dangerous!) public relations campaign by claiming the contrary.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s is no legal basis of any kind to overturn the results of the 2020 general election and not a shred of evidence to back up any claims of voter fraud.</p>
<p>Okay? Got it?</p>
<p>We can all exhale now.</p>

<p>This includes LeBron James.</p>
<p>The NBA legend captured his fourth championship this year when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in six games.</p>
<p>Customarily, the title winners from all American professional sports &#8212; basketball, football, hockey and baseball &#8212; visit the White House after earning their trophies, meeting the President and being feted at the country&#8217;s most famous residence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite an honor.</p>

<p>And yet&#8230; it&#8217;s an honor nearly every team has turned down ever since Donald Trump got elected Commander-in-Chief back in November of 2016.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because Donald Trump is a racist and a sociopath.</p>
<p>James, for his part, has never hidden his disdain for this President, either.</p>

<p>The superstar has referred to Trump as a &quot;bum&quot; on Twitter in the past, and Trump fired back in August 2018 by referencing an interview James conducted with CNN&#8217;s Don Lemon by Tweeting:</p>
<p><em>Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn&rsquo;t easy to do.</em></p>
<p><em>I like Mike.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a citation to Michael Jordan, who many believe to have been a better professional basketball player than James.</p>

<p>Fast forward to this week and an exchange James had on Twitter with Draymond Green.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoooo @KingJames y&rsquo;all can go to the White House and celebrate y&rsquo;all title G!&quot; the Golden State Warriors power forward wrote to his frenemy, prompting LeBron to respond as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;YO we back up in there my G!!! I&rsquo;m taking my tequila and vino too!&quot;</p>

<p>But the President of the United States nevertheless took some time out of his late Friday night to try and slam one home on&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; LeBron James?</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="919" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-919x1024.jpg" alt="Donald Trump at Lectern" class="wp-image-305060" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-919x1024.jpg 919w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-269x300.jpg 269w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-768x855.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-735x819.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-301x335.jpg 301w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-312x347.jpg 312w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-467x520.jpg 467w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-575x640.jpg 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-689x768.jpg 689w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-862x960.jpg 862w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-970x1080.jpg 970w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern.jpg 1370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The very stable genius, <a href="/videos/donald-trump-thinks-you-need-an-id-to-buy-groceries/">who thinks one needs an ID to purchase groceries</a>, jumped on Twitter around midnight and Tweeted the following about <a href="/2018/07/lebron-james-signs-154-dollars-million-contract-with-los-angeles/">the new Los Angeles Lakers star</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn&rsquo;t easy to do. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I like Mike!</strong></p>
<p>There are many things to point out about this Tweet.</p>
<p>For starters, Lemon interviewed LeBron on Monday night, meaning there are only one of two options here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Trump used TiVo to record the interview and watched it days later.</li>
	<li>
		Trump was simply watching CNN, the network he often claims &quot;sucks&quot; and is terrible and is full of &quot;fake news,&quot; when it re-aired the Q&amp;A.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either would be a totally normal thing for the Commander-in-Chief to do, right?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Secondly, LeBron James was interviewed by Lemon (along with other outlets) because he just opened a public school in Akron, Ohio.</p>
<p>To reiterate: James donated millions and millions of dollars to the I Promise school, an institution for&nbsp;at-risk children in his hometown that will offer:</p>
<p>&#8211; Free college tuition to the University of Arkon for all graduates.</p>
<p>&#8211; All students a free uniform, free bicycle and free helmet.</p>
<p>&#8211; Job assistance and GED training for the parents of all students.</p>
<p>&#8211; A food pantry for families.</p>
<p>&#8211; Free breakfast, lunch and snacks for all students.</p>
<p>One could easily argue this is the most generous and impressive off-court gesture ever made by a professiona athlete.</p>
<p>And THIS is the individual that President Trump has chosen to insult as unintelligent.</p>

<p>We wonder why.</p>
<p>Yes, James has referred to Trump as a &quot;bum&quot; on Twitter in the past and he also said in June that whichever team won the NBA title would turn down an invitation to visit the White House.</p>
<p>But head NBA coaches Steve Kerr and Greg Popovich has been <em>far</em> more critical of Trump.</p>
<p>The latter said in March that Trump is a liar and a hypocrite and that he brings out the &quot;dark side of human beings for his own purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet Trump has never uttered a negative word about Kerr or Popovich. We really do wonder why.</p>
<p>What makes LeBron different from these two other men in his profession. Can anyone out there help explain it to us?</p>

<p>In his CNN interview, James discussed the impact of sports and how it brings people together, contrasting this experience with the way Trump uses &quot;sports to kinda divide us.&quot;</p>
<p>A great example of this would be Trump&#8217;s constant bashing of NFL players for being unpatrotic because they are protesting violence against African-Americans by taking a knee during the national anthem.</p>
<p>&quot;Sports has never been something that divides people,&quot; James told Lemon. &quot;It&#8217;s always been something that brings someone together.&quot;</p>
<p>A few months ago, LeBron expounded further on Trump&#8217;s self-centered and misguided attitude toward&#8230; everything and everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#8217;t understand the power that he has for being the leader of this beautiful country,&quot; James said. &quot;He doesn&#8217;t understand how many kids, no matter the race, look up to the president of the United States for guidance, for leadership, for words of encouragement.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#8217;t understand that, and that&#8217;s what makes me more sick than anything, that we have someone that&#8217;s &#8230; this is the most, this is the No. 1 position in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>In his viral Tweet above, Trump said he likes Mike, very likely making a reference to Michael Jordan in the debate for who is the best basketball player of all-time.</p>
<p>The world now waits to see if Jordan will chime in with his opinion of the President.</p>
<p>It also now waits to see if Trump will get impeached for being a traitor.</p>

<p>Eight years after he dumped the Cavaliers in front of a national television audience, James came up with a far more inoffensive and discreet way to tell the world that he&#8217;s joining another basketball team.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, the management company in which LeBron has a stake issued a very simple press release that reads as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>LeBron James, four time NBA MVP, three time NBA Finals MVP, fourteen time NBA All Star, and two time Olympic Gold Medalist has agreed to a four year, $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.</em></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This move had been expected by most NBA followers for several weeks now, if not several months.</p>
<p>LeBron had the option to opt-out of this contract with the Cavaliers &#8212; and most fans expected him to do so following a turbulent season that only ended with another trip to the Finals because James may be the best basketball player in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>It was LeBron&#8217;s eighth consecutive trip to the concluding round of the NBA Playoffs.</p>
<p>But the Cavaliers got swept in the Finals by the Golden State Warriors and stood no real chance of competing with them for years to come.</p>
<p>Hence LeBron&#8217;s decision to join a team full of young, up-and-coming players, which is also situated in the entertainment capital of the world; whose city has great weather year-round; and which may trade for superstar Kawhi Leonard any day now.</p>
<p>LeBron owns two homes in Los Angeles and sources had claimed he and his family had been touring potential schools there for his 13-year old son.</p>
<p>Shortly after Klutch Sports Group made the above announcement, James made one of his own on Instagram:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>James finished second this year in the MVP race.</p>
<p>In 2016, he fulfilled his promise to bring Cleveland its first major pro sports championship in 52 years, leading his Cavs to an epic seven-game victory over those same Warriors in the Finals.</p>
<p>Some Cleveland fans will likely be hard on James for his decision to leave the Cavaliers for the second time in his career, but come on now.</p>
<p>He accomplished something historic as the face of the franchise just two years ago and Cleveland isn&#8217;t exactly the best run organization on the planet.</p>
<p>Also, the Cavs employ JR Smith.</p>
<p>Plus, now it will be easier for <a href="/2018/06/beyonce-and-lebron-james-accused-of-torrid-love-affair/">LeBron to keep hooking up with Beyonce</a>!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="732" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-732x1024.jpg" alt="LBJ" class="wp-image-300651" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-732x1024.jpg 732w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-768x1074.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-1098x1536.jpg 1098w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-1464x2048.jpg 1464w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-735x1028.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-239x335.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-248x347.jpg 248w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-372x520.jpg 372w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-458x640.jpg 458w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-549x768.jpg 549w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-686x960.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-772x1080.jpg 772w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/lbj-scaled.jpg 1830w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>LeBron leaves the franchise as its leader in nearly every major statistical category: games played, points, rebounds, assists and steals.</p>
<p>He played in all 82 games this past season and may have put on the best playoff individual performance in league history.</p>
<p>This will either make it easier for Cleveland fans to accept that he&#8217;s gone, having given everything one could during his final run there&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; or much harder because the guy is amazing.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>Go Celtics!</p>
