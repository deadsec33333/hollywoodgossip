<p>Kim Kardashian tackled a very sensitive subject with her family.</p>



<p>On <em>The Kardashians</em>, Khloe threw a birthday bash for Tristan&#8217;s brother, Amari.</p>



<p>While Khloe seeks to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hide her children from reality</a> in some ways, she and Kim both agree that they want their kids to know Amari &#8212; and others who are not like him.</p>



<p>In a delicate parenting moment, Kim did ask her kids if she felt &#8220;a little bit scared&#8221; attending her cousins&#8217; 18-year-old uncle&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-khloe-kardashian-threw-a-birthday-party-for-amari-thompson">Khloe Kardashian threw a birthday party for Amari Thompson</h2>



<p>During the most recent episode of <em>The Kardashians</em> on Hulu, the titular Kardashians celebrated a birthday.</p>



<p>Despite some <em>birthday discourse</em> earlier this season, Khloe threw the party. It was not for one of her famous sisters.</p>



<p>Instead, the birthday party was for Tristan Thompson&#8217;s brother. Amari, who has Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/khloe-kardashian-reveals-sons-face-everyone-meet-tatum-hes-so-cute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come up before on the show</a>.</p>

<p>On the Thursday, April 3 episode, Khloe commented about how small children do not always know how to react to someone with disabilities.</p>



<p>“My kids are much more exposed to Amari than some of the other kids,&#8221; the mother of two acknowledged. &#8220;So True is more concerned than frightened of Amari.&#8221;</p>



<p>Khloe very accurately added: “But I do think it is important for our kids &#8212; and everyone’s kids &#8212; to be exposed to all different types of people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-where-kim-kardashian-weighed-in">This is where Kim Kardashian weighed in</h2>



<p>Kim Kardashian, whose children are a little older, chimed in: “I love our kids growing up around him and helping him.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued, noting: “They have lots of questions and at times they might not be the most comfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim emphasized: &#8220;But I think it is so important that they play with him and they really get to know him.”</p>

<p>Later, Kim directly asked 6-year-old daughter Chicago if she and her friends felt &#8220;a little bit scared.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then stressed: “But it is OK if you are.”</p>



<p>Most 6-year-olds do not attend 18th birthday parties for people to whom they are related. However, the party went on without any apparent incident &#8212; until Amari&#8217;s brief seizure. </p>



<p>Kris Jenner seemed the most distressed by that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-lgs-like">What is LGS like?</h2>



<p>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare but severe epilepsy disorder that manifests during childhood. While about 95% of those with LGS survive into adulthood, the condition has numerous associations &#8212; including cognitive impairment, brain malformations, and even tumors.</p>



<p>Many with LGS suffer seizures almost daily. This is part of Amari&#8217;s life. </p>



<p>Tristan Thompson stepped up to care for his brother after his mother, Andrea, passed away in January 2023. </p>

<p>Kim Kardashian is considering the nuclear option when it comes to her children.</p>



<p>As previously discussed and detailed, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/">Kanye West released a new track</a> over the weekend titled &#8220;Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The artist&#8217;s daughter, North, has a cameo on this song &#8212; despite Kardashian having strongly voiced her disapproval of North being used in such fashion.</p>



<p>And despite the fact that the former couple&#8217;s divorce agreement says both sides must have an equal say when it comes to making decisions such as this in regard to their children.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, both Kim and Kanye attended a mediation session on Friday with their respective lawyers where they agreed that North would <em><strong>not</strong></em> appear on any version of this song if it were released.</p>



<p>West then went ahead and immediately violated this agreement.</p>



<p>Just before uploading the track on Saturday, the rapper even put up screenshots of alleged text conversations he claims to have had with Kardashian… as the exes went back and forth regarding the trademark of North’s name.</p>



<p>At one point in this exchange, West tells Kardashian “I’m never speaking with you again,” to which Kim replies:</p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-1024x681.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West attend The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-521499" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1147427757-1-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West attend The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>West also threatened &#8220;war&#8221; against is ex and said &#8220;neither of us will recover from the public fallout&#8221; if he takes that route, adding: &#8220;You’re going to have to kill me.”</p>



<p>One could argue, of course, that Kanye won&#8217;t recover from many of his recent actions outside of this spat&#8230; considering he&#8217;s just and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">out and proud Nazi at this point</a>.</p>



<p>But anyway.</p>



<p>Back to what Kim is now thinking about in the wake of this legal dispute&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="762" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-762x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-503069" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-762x1024.jpg 762w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-223x300.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-768x1031.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-1525x2048.jpg 1525w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-715x960.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-804x1080.jpg 804w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-894x1200.jpg 894w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-scaled.jpg 1906w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend the WSJ Magazine 2019 Innovator Awards at MOMA on November 6, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reality star is “seriously considering going to court to ask a judge to strip [Kanye] of joint legal custody,” writes TMZ.</p>



<p>To be clear, Kardashian already has <em>physical</em> custody of her children. She has never prevented them from seeing their dad, either.</p>



<p>However, Kim may make this extra move to ensure the safety of her kids and to disassociate them as much as possible from a man who certainly appears to be VERY far off his rocker.</p>



<p>Aside from North, Kim and Kanye share three other kids: Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 5.</p>

<p>West, for his part, has only responded to this latest feud by ranting like a mad man on social media.</p>



<p>“I DONT WANT TO JUST ‘SEE’ MY KIDS. I NEED TO RAISE THEM. I NEED TO HAVE SAY SO OF WEAR [sic] THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND WHOSE HOUSES THEY SLEEP OVER WEATHER [sic] MY DAUGHTERS WEAR LIPSTICK AND PERFUME,” he wrote via X on Saturday, March 15. </p>



<p>“ALL THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ME BY THE KARDASHIAN MOB, HULU AND DISNEY AND THE BIGGER AGENDA TO USE THE SELECTIVELY BRED BLACK CHILDREN TO BE PLATFORMS TO INFLUENCE BLACK PEOPLE.”</p>



<p>And when it comes to issues such as his daughter appearing on a rap song?</p>



<p>&#8220;THE MAN MAKES THE FINAL DECISION, West added.</p>



<p>The guy is such a sweetheart, isn&#8217;t he?</p>

<p>As we&#8217;re guessing you&#8217;ve heard by now, Kanye West has been off his rocker for awhile.</p>



<p>The rapper has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">declared himself to be a Nazi</a> and has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-im-a-billionaire-and-i-have-total-control-over-my-wife/">said he controls his wife</a> and basically issued one far right, nonsensical and insane statement after another for the last couple years.</p>



<p>West hasn&#8217;t really said anything about ex-spouse Kim Kardashian, however.</p>



<p>Until now.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1024x682.jpg" alt="Recording artist Kanye West and TV personality Kim Kardashian attend the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honoring Barbara Kruger and Quentin Tarantino presented by Gucci at LACMA on November 1, 2014 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-511591" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-458252540-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian attend the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honoring Barbara Kruger and Quentin Tarantino presented by Gucci at LACMA on November 1, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for LACMA)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On March 15, the troubled artist ranted and raved on social media over theownership of any trademarks related to the pair&#8217;s daughter North West’s name.</p>



<p>West did so amid a series of posts to Twitter&#8230; one of which included a new song featuring Diddy, Diddy’s son Christian “King” Combs and West’s oldest child with Kardashian.</p>



<p>Kanye shared the track, titled “LONELY ROADS STILL GO TO SUNSHINE,” directly to the social media account, even though &#8212; as TMZ writes &#8212; Kardashian tried to get a judge to <em>stop</em> this release from ever taking place.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to blame the reality star, considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/">Diddy has been arrested for sex trafficking</a> and other truly awful charges.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim and Kanye throwback" class="wp-image-503068" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party following the 92nd Oscars at The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills on February 9, 2020. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jean-Baptiste Lacroix / AFP) (Photo by JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to TMZ insiders, Kardashian sent out legal notices “demanding a cease &amp; desist” in regard to this single and had an “emergency hearing with a mediator and a judge,” which prompted West to promise he would not make the song public.</p>



<p>So it sounds as if he lied.</p>



<p>Just before uploading the track on Saturday, meanwhile, the rapper put up screenshots of alleged text conversations he claims to have had with Kardashian&#8230; as the exes go back and forth regarding the trademark of North’s name.</p>



<p>At one point in this exchange, West tells Kardashian “I’m never speaking with you again,&#8221; to which Kim replies: </p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-516509" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kim continued writing that the former spouses agreed when their kids were born that Kardashian would get their children’s names and trademarks “so no one else would take them.” </p>



<p>West didn&#8217;t counter this point, but allegedly replied: </p>



<p>“Amend it or I’m going to war And neither of us will recover from the public fallout You’re going to have to kill me.”</p>



<p>Kanye then asked his followers for their opinion on all of this ugliness.</p>



<p>For her part, Kim has not responded in public to the spat, but she previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kim-kardashian-breaks-divorce-silence-kanye-is-a-changed-and-awful-man/">said on an episode of The Kardashians</a> that West was &#8220;not the same person&#8221; she married and added of their divorce:</p>



<p>“It’s [tough] when you don’t want your marriage to end off of personal reasons but circumstances change that force your marriage to end.</p>



<p>“When you weren’t planning on that and that’s not really the outcome you want but there’s no other option, I think it makes it harder to get over.”</p>

<p>Are Jonathan Cheban and Kim Kardashian still friends? Still <em>besties</em>?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kim-kardashian-diamond-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drama on <em>The Kardashians</em></a> feels like a natural continuation of KUWTK. But one piece of Kim&#8217;s life has seemed to be missing recently.</p>



<p>Where is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/04/jonathan-cheban-is-kim-kardashians-bestie-hiding-secret-love-chi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her bestie</a>, alleged celebrity Jonathan Cheban?</p>



<p>Did they have a falling out? Did they simply drift apart after she became a mother of four?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-kim-kardashian-and-jonathan-cheban-still-friends">Are Kim Kardashian and Jonathan Cheban still friends?</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, March 11, Jonathan Cheban spoke to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/are-kim-kardashian-and-jonathan-cheban-still-friends-foodgod-dishes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> about Kim Kardashian and more.</p>



<p>“People post me in things and people say that Kim and I aren’t friends anymore,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;And it’s so funny to watch this stuff ‘cause we are friends and we talk all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cheban continued: “I see all these things that pop up and that’s how I know if I’m on [episodes of <em>The Kardashians</em>] or not.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Jonathan Cheban on November 22, 2024." class="wp-image-521302" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jonathan Cheban attends amfAR Las Vegas Presented By Paramount at Wynn Las Vegas on November 22, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ethan Miller/Getty Images for amfAR)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Jonathan Cheban admits that he does not always watch <em>The Kardashians</em>, he does keep up with Kim Kardashian off-screen.</p>



<p>“We’re going to be friends forever &#8212; and it’s fun,” he affirmed. He then acknowledged: “I mean, she’s got so many kids and so many things to do and I’m all the way on this coast.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cheban continued: &#8220;So it’s like, yeah, we don’t see each other as much. But we talk all the time and anything happens that I feel like we should discuss, we just send it right away.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-kardashian-and-jonathan-cheban-maintain-a-friendship-around-their-busy-schedules">Kim Kardashian and Jonathan Cheban maintain a friendship around their busy schedules</h2>



<p>Jonathan Cheban does, in fact, live on the East Coast. He notes that he travels &#8220;all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of those visits take him to California. But other trips take him to Italy. He&#8217;s been in New York most recently.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, of course, Kim Kardashian lives on the opposite coast from Jonathan Cheban. </p>

<p>“This is pretty iconic,” Cheban gushed when speaking about the opening of Planet Hollywood in NYC.</p>



<p>“Not only is the weather amazing, I mean, this is such a major thing to happen in New York [and] for a New York comeback,&#8221; he gushed. &#8220;I’m moving back to New York after five years. I’m so excited to be here, this is awesome.”</p>



<p>It seems that, by and large, Cheban hoped to promote the restaurant opening. The Kim questions were merely part of the package.</p>

<p>By far, the most memorable Jonathan Cheban moment does not involve Kim Kardashian. Rather, it involves <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/martha-stewart-disses-golden-bachelorette/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cultural icon Martha Stewart</a>.</p>



<p>In 2016, she publicly <a href="https://x.com/MarthaStewart/status/745685639153197057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> who he was, adding that &#8220;he says he is well known.&#8221; Ouch!</p>



<p>Truly an indelible moment involving this seemingly <em>delible </em>man.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian lost a massive diamond at a garishly expensive event.</p>



<p>Years ago, Kim famously lost a valuable earring while swimming in water. It led to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kourtney-kardashian-earring-quote-kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-callback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney&#8217;s biggest meme</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/kim-kardashian-still-traumatized-by-robbery-1-year-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life experience</a> has taught her to wear less jewelry. With some exceptions.</p>



<p>One exception was a $600 million wedding. And that&#8217;s a <em>lowball </em>estimate of the cost of the event that cost Kim a sizable diamond.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-kardashian-was-all-decked-out-in-jewels">Kim Kardashian was all decked out in jewels</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, March 13 <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/7840bf30-f440-48d4-bf81-55d8cb24457a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <em>The Kardashians</em>, Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian went all out in diamond jewelry and more.</p>



<p>The Season 6, Episode 6 storyline followed the famous sisters as they attended the wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant.</p>



<p>The 6-day wedding took place in July of 2024 in Mumbai, India. Neither sister had met the groom or the bride, both scions of extraordinarily wealthy business families. But they received invitations for at least two of the days of celebration.</p>

<p>On <em>The Kardashians</em>, Kim and Khloe Kardashian showed off their luxurious rooms. Some of the extravagant piece of jewelry on display were designed by Lorraine Schwartz, who is a friend to the sisters and also designs pieces for the Ambani family.</p>



<p>Kim, on the second night of the event, wore a massive necklace that was dripping with teardrop diamonds.</p>



<p>Both Kardashian sisters rubbed elbows at the event, but when Kim realized that she was missing a diamond, the two flew into a panic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hunt-for-the-diamond-begins">The hunt for the diamond begins!</h2>



<p>Khloe Kardashian called over Schwartz to point out &#8220;this is missing,&#8221; indicating that Kim had lost a diamond. The hunt began.</p>



<p>Speaking to the confessional camera, Kim detailed how much was gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was like the big diamond necklace, like a bib, and then there were pearls and big pear-shaped diamonds hanging from it,&#8221; Kim described. We are unsure if Schwartz would have characterized it as a <em>bib</em>, but we are not professional jewelers.</p>

<p>As if attempting to retrace steps, Khloe recalled: &#8220;I think when we were talking to the sister, the diamond fell.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sure enough, there was slow-motion footage of the diamond falling to the ground.</p>



<p>Kim described the hunt for the diamond: &#8220;We&#8217;re looking all over the floor, trying to see where it went, looking in my top, looking in my skirt. It&#8217;s nowhere to be found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite a detailed search, the jeweled teardrop never turned up. Kim and Khloe Kardashian opted to do a photoshoot with some beautiful flowers, despite the missing diamond.</p>



<p>In retrospect, Khloe joked that Kim &#8220;hasn&#8217;t thought about it since.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim insisted: &#8220;I felt bad in the moment.&#8221; The episode included a cheeky title card reading: &#8220;In Loving Memory of The Ambani Wedding Diamond.&#8221; <em>Goofy</em>.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian does not really discuss Damon Thomas.</p>



<p>Though Kim has collected <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-takes-out-super-bowl-ad-for-yeezy-website-that-only-sells-swastika-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regrettable ex-husbands</a>, he was the first. Yes, even before Kris Humphries.</p>



<p>However, in praising one of her sisters, Kim could not help but bring up her first marriage.</p>



<p>And how that sister helped her through her first divorce.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-2004-kim-kardashian-divorced-damon-thomas">In 2004, Kim Kardashian divorced Damon Thomas</h2>



<p>The Thursday, March 6 <a href="https://www.hulu.com/watch/7fd65e2f-6026-42c9-8aff-cfec5e87aac9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <em>The Kardashians</em> was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all about Khloe Kardashian</a>. It was a special birthday tribute episode to her.</p>



<p>Many members of the famous family shared warm anecdotes about Khloe &#8212; as a daughter, a sister, a mother, an aunt, and as a friend.</p>



<p>One of Kim Kardashian&#8217;s fond memories began when Khloe Kardashian was just a child. Khloe received an enormous piggy bank styled after a glass Coca-Cola bottle, and began to fill it with cash and change.</p>

<p>&#8220;She got this piggy bank that was as tall as us, it was like a Coke bottle and we would put so much money in it,&#8221; Kim Kardashian explained before bringing up how Damon Thomas factored into this.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was getting my first divorce,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;I moved out and I had no money.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim detailed: &#8220;I was 21, and she was like, &#8216;Here, you can have my Coke bottle.'&#8221; Khloe Kardashian is four years younger than Kim, who divorced Damon Thomas in 2004.</p>

<p>According to Kim, a then-teenage Khloe &#8220;stayed up all night&#8221; with her as the two manually counted the cash from inside of the bottle.</p>



<p>Ultimately, she revealed, the bottle &#8212; Khloe&#8217;s childhood savings (outside of the family trust) &#8212; contained approximately $6,000. And Khloe gave it all to Kim.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was just enough for me to get the down payment on my apartment,&#8221; Kim recounted, &#8220;and pay my first and last month&#8217;s rent.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2004, Kim Kardashian divorced Damon Thomas. The two had been married for four years.</p>



<p>Khloe vividly recounted why she had made such a generous decision about her older sister&#8217;s plight at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was crying in my room,&#8221; Khloe told the camera. &#8220;I was just like, &#8216;OK, I have this Coke bottle. Let’s take what’s in here, go to the bank and cash it &#8212; and let&#8217;s use this money for your divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tribute episode of The Kardashians showed how Kim had gotten Khloe a new bottle and filled with with a lot of $100 bills.</p>



<p>We cannot attest to the exact value of the contents. But these days, Kim doesn&#8217;t exactly need to borrow cash to rent an apartment. And Khloe doesn&#8217;t really have to count the cash.</p>

<p>On a recent episode of her family&#8217;s reality show, Kim Kardashian dropped an interesting bombshell.</p>



<p>In the wake of her portrayal as an evil publicist named Siobhan Corbyn on <em>American Horror Story: Delicate</em>, the former sex tape participant got candid about her future in the entertainment industry.</p>



<p>And why she knows it may not last forever.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-s-acting-career-reaches-new-heights">Kim&#8217;s Acting Career Reaches New Heights</h2>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have an agent, and then after <em>American Horror Story</em>… all these different people wanted to meet,&#8221; Kardashian explained to her friends, adding at the time:</p>



<p>&#8220;We literally spent a day, we went to all the studios, and everyone called within, like, 20 minutes with offers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim actually isn&#8217;t terrible in the aforementioned series.</p>



<p>She also pretended back in the day that she really enjoyed sleeping with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/ray-j/">Ray J</a> on camera, so her acting ability may be far superior to what many had previously assumed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian at MET Gala" class="wp-image-502372" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151793286-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-s-newest-project">Kim&#8217;s Newest Project</h2>



<p>As it turns out, Kardashian broke the news on this episode that she will star in a Netflix film titled <em>The Fifth Wheel</em>, which she described as an ensemble &#8220;full comedy&#8221; from the mind of writer Paula Pell.</p>



<p>Kim will even serve as a producer on the project.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t planning on this career, and I was like, &#8216;Okay, I&#8217;m not gonna get ahead of myself here,'&#8221; she said on air. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really nervous about it, because I have to f-cking deliver…. Every year I want to do something that makes me so uncomfortable that I really have to challenge myself.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-502371" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2150194051-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian attends a roundtable discussion on criminal justice reform hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on April 25, 2024 in Washington, DC. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of her acting range, meanwhile, Kim came across as pretty funny and very self-aware during this portion of <em>The Kardashians </em>installment.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like you need less Botox for more emotion, and I do not have that,&#8221; she joked. &#8220;How am I gonna be scared? How am I gonna cry?&#8221;</p>



<p>At last year&#8217;s Tom Brady Roast, of course, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kim-kardashian-robot-andrew-schulz-tom-brady-roast/">Kim was compared to a robot</a> who lacked any and all aspects of being an actual human.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t go that far in her own self-assessment. But is at least able to laugh off the metaphor.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian at a party" class="wp-image-502369" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1798189945-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian attends the GQ Men of the Year Party 2023 VIP dinner at Chateau Marmont on November 16, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for GQ)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-kim-kardashian">What&#8217;s Next For Kim Kardashian?</h2>



<p>Via a confessional, Kardashian also looked ahead and made a startling statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can do a movie a year,&#8221; she said the camera with a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got about 10 years where I still look good, so that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got in me, and then I&#8217;ll take some time off.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not certain how serious Kardashian was being at this time, but it&#8217;s a revealing admission.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s sad that Kim believes her acting career would be entirely reliant on her looks. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-1024x576.png" alt="Kim Kardashian wears all black while speaking to the confessional camera on The Kardashians in 2023." class="wp-image-489108" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1109_thekardashians_05_kimkardashian.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On The Kardashians, Kim Kardashian addresses the confessional camera.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But if does decide to step away from the spotlight, she clearly has plenty of other interests.</p>



<p>Most recently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kim-kardashian-menendez-brothers-resentencing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim helped the Menendez brothers</a> in their efforts to secure a new sentencing hearing. And there have been rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kim-kardashian-to-replace-vanna-white-on-wheel-of-fortune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim might replace Vanna White</a> on <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>! </p>



<p>There&#8217;s no hard age limit on that gig! Vanna is still going strong in her late sixties!</p>



<p>Anyway, Kim seems to understand that her fame is largely based on her looks above anything else &#8212; and that Hollywood is unfortunately known for ignoring older woman who are unable to maintain a youthful or sexy appearance.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll see how much longer Kim Kardashian is able to stay in the spotlight, but we think we all know the <em>real</em> answer to long-term success is for her to stop insulting Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s clear <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kim-kardashian-to-taylor-swift-leave-me-alone-already/">she&#8217;s losing this battle</a>.</p>

<p>On the latest episode of The Kardashians, Kim Kardashian finally addressed the evolution of her ex-husband into a full-fledged Nazi.</p>



<p>Kinda. Sorta. In a matter of speaking, that is.</p>



<p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">Kanye West declaring himself to be an anti-Semite</a>, however, Kim talked more at length than usual on this reality show installment about the demise of her relationship with the misguided rapper.</p>

<p>After sister Khloe labeled ex-husband Lamar Odom as &#8220;the love of [her] life&#8221; and said her romance with him fell apart over a shocking drug addiction, Kim chimed in and related to her sibling.</p>



<p>&#8220;That’s the hardest part. I’ve been there,&#8221; Kardashian said, obviously referring to her split from West. </p>



<p>&#8220;When you don’t foresee something happening that really changes a person’s personality and then they’re not the same person and you can’t ever get that person back, but you can’t live with the new person. I get it.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a confessional, Kim continued to reflect. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s tougher when you don’t want your marriage to end off of personal reasons but circumstances change that force your marriage to end.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you weren’t planning on that and that’s not really the outcome you want but there’s no other option, I think it makes it harder to get over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reality star and West share daughters North, 11, and Chicago, 6, and sons Saint, 9, and Psalm, 5.</p>



<p>The former filed for divorce after six years together in 2021&#8230; following a series of ups and downs as the rapper struggled with his bipolar disorder and appeared to have a mental breakdown.</p>



<p>&#8220;I very much desire to be divorced,&#8221; Kim wrote in a legal filing years ago, adding back then:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have asked Kanye to keep our divorce private, but he has not done so. Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private family matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress.</p>



<p>&#8220;While I wish our marriage would have succeeded, I have come to the realization that there is no way to repair our marriage. Kanye does not agree but at least it appears that he has come to the realization that I want to end our marriage, even if he does not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just over the past several days, West has been back in the news &#8212; for a variety of ugly reasons.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s been sued for allegedly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-sued-for-allegedly-harassing-jewish-employees-welcome-to-your-first-day-working-for-hitler/">harassing a Jewish employee</a> and he&#8217;s declared that he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-im-a-billionaire-and-i-have-total-control-over-my-wife/">has total dominion over</a> his new wife, Bianca Censori.</p>



<p>Following her divorce from West, meanwhile, the mother of four dated Pete Davidson for nine months and was most recently linked to Odell Beckham Jr., although that connection only lasted for a brief period of time and ended in April 2024.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing you can always rely on when it comes to Pete Davidson &#8212; the man never stays single for long.</p>



<p>But unfortunately, he has a tendency to commemorate his short-lived romances with tattoos. And that can create problems</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kim-kardashian-heres-the-real-reason-everyone-wants-to-bang-pete-davidson/">Pete&#8217;s relationship with Kim Kardashian</a> appeared to be more serious than most of his A-list dalliances (it lasted a lot longer, anyway), but that didn&#8217;t stop the former SNL star from diving back into the dating pool after he and Kim broke up.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="703" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-1024x703.jpg" alt="US socialite Kim Kardashian and comedian Pete Davidson arrive for the 2022 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2022, in New York." class="wp-image-518272" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-1024x703.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-300x206.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-768x527.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-2048x1405.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-960x659.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-1080x741.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1240409720-1200x823.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">US socialite Kim Kardashian and comedian Pete Davidson arrive for the 2022 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2022, in New York.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When his romance with Kim ended, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kim-kardashian-is-sounding-totally-jealous-that-pete-davidsons-boning-emily-ratajkowski/">Pete appeared to have a fling with Emily Ratajkowski</a>, but whatever went on there, it was over within a few weeks.</p>



<p>Pete was later spotted publicly canoodling with his <em>Bodies Bodies Bodies</em> costar Chase Sui Wonders.</p>



<p>After that, he dated Outer Banks star Madelyn Chase. They went out for a year before calling it quits in July of 2024.</p>



<p>Obviously, none of Pete&#8217;s partners mind a man with a bit of a past, and they must know about Pete&#8217;s reputation as Hollywood&#8217;s biggest ladies&#8217; man.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean they want to be reminded of it every time he takes his shirt off.</p>



<p>During his relationship with Kim, Pete paid tribute to the mother of four with (at least) three tattoos and a freakin&#8217; brand.</p>

<p></p>



<p>(Yes, he had Kim&#8217;s name seared into his flesh with a red-hot iron. If that&#8217;s not love, we don&#8217;t know what is!)</p>



<p>And according to a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11665061/How-Pete-Davidson-tried-ERASE-Kim-Kardashian-life.html">new report </a>from UK tabloid <em>The Daily Mail</em>, Pete is now in the process of having his tattoos removed, including the Kim-related ones.</p>



<p>The tabloid reports that when Pete and Chase vacationed in Hawaii, onlookers noticed that one of Pete&#8217;s neck tattoos had been removed. </p>

<p></p>



<p>The blank space on Pete&#8217;s flesh previously bore the initials of Kim&#8217;s four kids. The removal process has been ongoing ever since.</p>



<p>Pete also has ink that reads &#8220;my girl is a lawyer&#8221; ( a reference to Kim&#8217;s legal aspirations) and a separate tattoo reading &#8220;Jasmine and Aladdin&#8221; (a reference to an SNL sketch the two starred in before their relationship began).</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, he has a few tattoos. A few cute ones that he got,&#8221; Kim told Ellen DeGeneres while she and Pete were still dating. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s so cute,&#8217; but that&#8217;s what tattoo people do, right? They get tattoos of what&#8217;s going on in their life,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>Yes, we suppose that&#8217;s what some &#8220;tattoo people&#8221; do.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Kim is no longer &#8220;what&#8217;s going on&#8221; in Pete&#8217;s life, so he&#8217;s decided to undergo the painful process of having her name removed from his flesh.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we live in a time in which tattoos can be removed with the help of lasers.</p>



<p>Of course, the procedure is prohibitively expensive, so unless you have Pete&#8217;s kind of money, you should probably still be cautious about your ink-related decisions.</p>



<p>No word yet on what Pete plans to do about his that brand of Kim&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>We guess the only way to blot out a brand is with another brand &#8212; which sounds incredibly painful.</p>



<p>While we&#8217;re sure Pete doesn&#8217;t mind his reputation as Hollywood&#8217;s premier ladies&#8217; man, he says he&#8217;s now trying to move on from that life.</p>



<p>“I just want to be known for doing good work. I want to be out there only when it’s [a] movie, stand-up, charity, or business ventures,” he told W magazine in December 2024 (via <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/01/31/celebrity-news/pete-davidson-says-hes-the-girl-in-a-relationship-and-likes-assertiveness/">Page Six</a>). “That’s when I want to be seen. I don’t want to be this f—ing loser who just dates people. That’s not who I am.”</p>



<p>Hey, doing good work is important. But dating the hottest women in Hollywood is nothing to look down your nose at!</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian just dropped a new music video in celebration of the holiday season.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some fans are a little confused about exactly what holiday she&#8217;s celebrating.</p>



<p>The clip is accompanied by a classic Christmas song, but the visuals are definitely delivering Halloween vibes!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-1024x576.webp" alt="Kim Kardashian croons and crawls in her new holiday-themed music video." class="wp-image-515655" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/kim-kardashian-smolders-travis-barker-95783059.webp 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian croons and crawls in her new holiday-themed music video.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Kim Kardashian/YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-kardashian-s-take-on-santa-baby-draws-criticism">Kim Kardashian&#8217;s Take on &#8216;Santa Baby&#8217; Draws Criticism</h2>



<p>In the video &#8212; a collaboration with visual artist Nadia Lee Cohen and Kim&#8217;s brother-in-law <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/travis-barker/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Barker</a> &#8212; the 44-year-old crawls across the floor of a raucous party scene while crooning the yuletide tune popularized by Eartha Kitt.</p>



<p>At the end of her journey, we learn that the scene was being filmed by Santa himself &#8212; who, in this Lynchian nightmare world is played by a different Christmas icon, Macaulay Culkin.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-1024x572.png" alt="Kim Kardashian crawls through a bizarre holiday party scene in her new music video." class="wp-image-515649" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-300x167.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-2048x1143.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-960x536.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-23-at-8.48.54-AM-2-1080x603.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian crawls through a bizarre holiday party scene in her new music video.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Kim Kardashian/YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not surprisingly, the project has received something of a mixed response from fans, many of whom are unsure about what Kim and company were trying to convey.</p>



<p>“Is this for Halloween? Because this scares me,&#8221; one commenter wrote, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/23/entertainment/kim-kardashian-smolders-in-travis-barker-produced-santa-baby-music-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Someone explain this Kim Kardashian video to me like I’m 5,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/morgan_xy/status/1871158884406345840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another tweeted</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;Kim Kardashian’s need for attention is crazy,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/gothpjms/status/1871142949456941344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y’all don’t think that video Kim Kardashian did was creepy?&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/O_Truths/status/1871090731542069730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fourth asked</a>.</p>



<p>Kim hasn&#8217;t responded to the backlash, and it&#8217;s unlikely that she will. After all, it&#8217;s not the job of an artist to explain her work to the critics!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-s-christmas-capers">Kim&#8217;s Christmas Capers</h2>



<p>The video caps off an eventful holiday weekend for Kim.</p>



<p>On Saturday, she hosted a holiday party for her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kim-kardashian-unveils-skims-ultimate-nipple-bra-receives-praise-and-gratitude/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skims</a> employees. Kim is still recovering from a broken foot, but she made her injury festive with a red-and-green boot.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2182572392-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 02, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>She also seized the opportunity to recreate <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/11/kim-kardashian-nude-paper-magazine-pics-are-photoshopped-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iconic <em>Paper</em> magazine photo</a> that &#8220;broke the internet&#8221; back in 2014.</p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s been a full decade since Kim wowed the world with those memorable pics.</p>



<p>At the time, she was newly married to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kanye-west/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a> and had recently welcomed her first child.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="641" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1254365114-641x1024.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian and daughter North West attend the the Western Conference Semifinal Playoff game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena on May 12, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Obviously, a whole lot has changed in the years since.</p>



<p>But Kim is still pushing the envelope with projects that have some fans applauding and others scratching their heads.</p>



<p>We hope that she&#8217;ll continue to express herself in divisive ways for many decades to come!</p>
