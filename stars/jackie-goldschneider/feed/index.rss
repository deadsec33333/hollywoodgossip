<p>If you&#8217;ve been following <em>Real Housewives</em> news this year, one word has been haunting headlines.</p>



<p>Ozempic. And speculation about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/melissa-gorga-i-never-said-kyle-richards-had-an-ozempic-body-i-just-said-i-thought-she-did/">who does or does not have an &#8220;Ozempic body.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>The life-saving diabetes drug has helped so many rich people lose weight that there are documented shortages of it in multiple countries. Between that and potential side effects, it&#8217;s very controversial.</p>



<p><em>RHONJ</em>&#8216;s Jackie Goldschneider just quipped that she might eventually become the &#8220;last woman&#8221; not using Ozempic for weight loss.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-472166" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0329_jackiegoldschneider_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Despite her demotion to &#8220;Friend of&#8221; this season, Jackie Goldschneider stood up for her actual friend. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This didn&#8217;t start with some long manifesto of Jackie Goldschneider&#8217;s on her Instagram. In fact, it didn&#8217;t start on her page.</p>



<p>Instead, <em>The Real Housewives of Orange County</em> star Emily Simpson posted a photo of herself in a fun, flirty catsuit. Apparently, the boys beside her made donning the new ensemble a challenge.</p>



<p>But what drew the eyes of fans was her figure. She looks wildly, <em>wildly </em>slender.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the final week of June, Emily Simpson shared a photo to Instagram that showcased her ultra-slim figure.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Emily Simpson has been beautiful the entire time.</p>



<p>Like her, don&#8217;t like her, or feel torn? That&#8217;s fine. Emily makes different impressions upon different people.</p>



<p>And, frankly, she makes a lot of different impressions whether she&#8217;s on the show or on social media.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-477721" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0615_rhoc_14_emilysimpson_shannonbeador.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">When Emily Simpson informs Shannon Beador that she was super rude earlier, the latter gasps in astonishment.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Emily was beautiful then and is beautiful now, she certainly looks different.</p>



<p>While there are a number of weight loss techniques (short of genetics, the usual secret is &#8220;money&#8221;), most thought of Ozempic as the cause.</p>



<p>The drug&#8217;s controversy and scarcity has not reduced interest in it. So many people discussed the drug that <em>Page Six</em> reported on Emily&#8217;s pic, sharing it on their own Instagram page.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be the last (wo)man standing,&#8221; Jackie Goldschneider quipped in an Instagram comment that caused quite a stir. She was referring to other Housewives who have misused a life-saving medicine for easy, risky weight loss.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is where Jackie Goldschneider commented.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be the last (wo)man standing,&#8221; she wrote in a comment.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, she did not condemn or even call out Emily Simpson &#8212; or anyone else. She even clarified that in a follow-up comment.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this follow-up Instagram comment, Jackie Goldschneider clarified that she was not talking about anyone but herself.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though Jackie was not attacking anyone, it seems that her meaning is clear.</p>



<p>She will never, personally, use Ozempic to suppress her appetite and thus lose weight. And not only because of the known side effects (or the potential side effects).</p>



<p>And her statement seems to imply that she is not holding out hope that this is true for the majority of other Housewives.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">RHOBH Season 13 cast members Sutton Stracke, Annemarie Wiley, Garcelle Beauvais, Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley, and Crystal Kung Minkoff pose together in Barcelona. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kyle Richards has repeatedly denied having an &#8220;Ozempic body.&#8221;</p>



<p>She even had a bit of conflict with Melissa Gorga over the latter&#8217;s alleged insinuation to the contrary.</p>



<p>Kyle was looking particularly thin in pics. People may have jumped to conclusions while trying to explain it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Though Kyle Richards looks both beautiful and stylish in this mirror selfie, numerous fans expressed alarm at how easily they can count her ribs. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then there&#8217;s Jennifer Fessler, a &#8220;Friend of&#8221; from the latest season of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>.</p>



<p>As the season aired, her public appearances showed a distinct contrast from her on-screen looks.</p>



<p>She strongly hinted that she had made use of Ozempic for weight loss.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-471710" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0323_jenniferfessler_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Watch What Happens Live, Jennifer Fessler weighed in on a number of topics &#8212; especially her friends. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So why isn&#8217;t Jackie Goldschneider availing herself of this &#8220;miracle weight loss drug?&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s not a miracle. It&#8217;s also not really a weight loss drug. At least, not intentionally.</p>



<p>It can cause multiple side effects while someone takes it. The weight generally returns when you stop taking it. Oh, and the <a href="https://www.ozempic.com/important-safety-information.html">lab mice in testing Ozempic developed some pretty nasty cancer</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this moment from RHONJ, Jackie Goldschneider became emotional when discussing her history of disordered eating. It was commendable that she spoke about this sensitive topic &#8212; and about her recovery.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But also, Jackie knows firsthand the perils of uncontrolled weight loss. </p>



<p>A person seeking &#8220;control&#8221; in their life will lose weight, become unhealthy, and still receive praise from our fatphobic society.</p>



<p>Jackie has moved beyond that kind of thinking and is much healthier these days. She&#8217;s making good choices.</p>

<p>We have heard so much about this ugly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/did-melissa-gorga-really-ban-teresa-and-fam-from-her-beach-house-of-course-not/">feud between Teresa Giudice and the Gorgas</a>.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, we heard from both sides.</p>



<p>Even as Luis tried to patch things up, Teresa fumed. Some of her insults towards Melissa were serious low blows.</p>



<p>When Jackie Goldschneider spoke up, Teresa snapped, screaming at her and doubling down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After previously not delving into this topic, Teresa Giudice opened up to a few RHONJ castmates about the pizza conflict. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to everyone involved, they put off discussing the pizza conflict for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Simply put, there was an idea to create a pizza business as a tribute to Teresa and Joe&#8217;s late father.</p>



<p>Money was a factor. Apparently, Luis put up six figures to join in on the venture. According to her, her then-fiance then lost a quarter of a million dollars. And she blames Joe.</p>

<p>Genuinely, we had to rewatch some scenes to figure out what the two sides were saying. Even then &#8230; we&#8217;re sure that there are a lot of details that never made it to air, and perhaps never came up on camera.</p>



<p>It sounds like Teresa is saying that Joe backed out and it cost Luis big time, which proved Teresa right. She didn&#8217;t want to mix business and family. For once.</p>



<p>But that is not the same version that Joe and Melissa shared. Obviously.</p>

<p>During the same episode, Joe expressed a similar reluctance to his sister&#8217;s to discuss it.</p>



<p>However, like Teresa, his reluctance did not actually prevent him from delving into the pizza crisis.</p>



<p>According to him, he was initially excited to go into this project with Luis.</p>

(Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, he and Melissa recalled, after ordering a group of pizza ovens, he heard about some pizza boxes. This was the first that he had heard of it.</p>



<p>Apparently, Teresa had done a photoshoot with her daughters for the pizza boxes. This was the first that Joe had heard of it.</p>



<p>There were clearly more to the conflict with that (including something about arguing about who receives what percentage of profits and ownership), but this is a reality TV episode, not a court case. Even if they listed every detail, not everything made it into the episode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After Joe Gorga shared his side of things, Melissa Gorga weighed in &#8230; theorizing that her sister-in-law is simply too selfish to share. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Melissa Gorga, the root of all of this is Teresa&#8217;s selfishness.</p>



<p>She suspected that Tre was too fundamentally self-centered to share a project like this &#8230; even with her brother, even in tribute to their dearly departed dad.</p>



<p>Anyway, later in the episode, it was Teresa&#8217;s turn to speculate about people&#8217;s mental states and motivations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Luis Ruelas tried to play peacemaker with Melissa Gorga. Teresa Giudice intervened. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Luis sat down with Melissa, who could tell that he was hoping to forge a path to piece for them all.</p>



<p>Of course, Melissa has seen another side to him. She commented on how this seems to be the side of who Luis wants to be and the side of who Luis <em>actually is</em>.</p>



<p>Either way, Teresa stormed over to intervene. And then she went and complained to her friends, and non-friends, about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Here, Teresa Giudice shares her thoughts while faithful minion Jennifer Aydin stands by her side. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“My brother needs to get therapy because he keeps blaming me for everything,&#8221; Teresa griped.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s not just me, she has daddy issues she needs to go get help,” she gossiped to Margaret Josephs and to Jackie Goldschneider.</p>



<p>Now, Jackie is a friend of both Melissa and Joe. She sighed and quietly observed that &#8220;that&#8217;s not nice.&#8221; True.</p>

<p>“Jackie, shut the f&#8211;k up, get out of my f&#8211;king face!” Teresa screamed at her.</p>



<p>“Get out of my f&#8211;king face, get out of my face, shut the f&#8211;k up, get out of my face!” she continued. For the record, Jackie was not in her face, and she did not shut up.</p>



<p>Instead, Jackie asked Teresa if she understands that that was a &#8220;mean thing to say about somebody who lost their dad in a car accident&#8221; when she was only a teenager. Melissa had just turned 17.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice absolutely does not want to hear any callouts about how unkind she has been. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“There’s nothing wrong with that,” Teresa insisted. “She’s attached to my brother like, yeah, there’s issues.”</p>



<p>In the confessional, she added: “Melissa always talked about that she had daddy issues, how her father would go out all the time and he was cheating on the mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>She told the camera: &#8220;He was never home, so that’s why she always had a leash on my brother.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Calmly, Jackie Goldschneider pointed out the inherent cruelty of her castmate&#8217;s insult. It did not go over well. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in the actual scene, Teresa stormed off, declaring that Jackie was &#8220;pissing me the f&#8211;k off, you&#8217;re getting involved with family.&#8221; </p>



<p>Bonkers. </p>



<p>She then stormed off, citing her work in therapy for why she didn&#8217;t go after Jackie even more. All over a &#8220;that&#8217;s not nice.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actually, Teresa Giudice doesn&#8217;t see anything wrong with the things that she said. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Teresa told Melissa that she didn&#8217;t want her as part of the wedding because Melissa didn&#8217;t stand up to Margaret Josephs for revealing Luis&#8217; alarming history.</p>



<p>Of course, Melissa noted that Jennifer had called Joe a &#8220;crook&#8221; and &#8220;bitch boy&#8221; last season &#8230; without Teresa defending him. </p>



<p>But of course, in Teresa&#8217;s world, it doesn&#8217;t have to go both ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Following years of hard work, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/jackie-goldschneider-is-making-strides-battling-eating-disorder-im-not-there-yet/">Jackie Goldschneider has been making strides battling her disordered eating</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> star knows that this is not a &#8220;quick fix.&#8221; She increased her efforts when her kids began to notice her habits.</p>



<p>Now, she is taking aim at a <em>RHONY </em>alum &#8212; one who, she believes, has made unhealthy body image <em>central </em>to her brand.</p>



<p>Jackie is going after Bethenny Frankel. She is, after all, the &#8220;Skinnygirl mogul&#8221; as everyone calls her. And Jackie may have a point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Jackie Goldschneider spoke to Evan Real and Danny Murphy of <em>Page Six</em> during <a href="https://pagesix.com/podcasts/virtual-reali-tea/">the <em>Virtual Reali-Tea</em> podcast</a> this week.</p>



<p>She has taken time exploring her own health journey and all of the factors that led her to where she is today.</p>



<p>All of that has made her much more aware of the pernicious parts of society that actively encourage or even <em>reward </em>disordered eating.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“Bethenny has Skinnygirl,&#8221; Jackie pointed out, referring to the <em>RHONY </em>alum&#8217;s brand.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I’ve got a very strong opinion on this one,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>



<p>Jackie feels so strongly about this &#8220;because I say, ‘F–k marketing skinny.&#8217;” </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="735" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-1024x735.png" alt="Bethenny Shocked at Reunion" class="wp-image-332831" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-1024x735.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-300x215.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-768x552.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-735x528.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-335x241.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-347x249.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-520x373.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-640x460.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-960x689.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion-1080x776.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/bethenny-shocked-at-reunion.png 1114w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I’m sick of f–king marketing skinny,&#8221; Jackie then reiterated.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t want to drink something because it’s going to keep me skinny,&#8221; she emphasized. That shows a lot of growth.</p>



<p>&#8220;So f–k you, Bethenny!&#8221; Jackie then declared. &#8220;F–k your skinny brand. That’s how I really feel.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jackie Goldschneider smiles here and poses for the camera. She shared this photo on Instagram.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Bethenny&#8217;s representative came out with a response.</p>



<p>Of course, the response plugged Bethenny&#8217;s book.</p>



<p>“Bethenny has personal experience with this topic,&#8221; her rep noted, &#8220;and speaks about it in detail in her book ‘Naturally Thin’ and ‘Business Is Personal.’&#8221;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re plugging your client&#8217;s product in a rebuttal &#8230; well, it&#8217;s relevant, but it feels a little awkward, you know?</p>



<p>“Jackie has reached out to Bethenny and corresponded several times,&#8221; the rep went on.</p>



<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; the rep then shaded, &#8220;it’s interesting that she didn’t reach out there.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="757" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-1024x757.png" alt="Jackie Goldschneider Has Regrets" class="wp-image-317996" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-1024x757.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-300x222.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-768x568.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-735x543.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-335x248.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-347x257.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-520x384.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-640x473.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-960x710.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets.png 1066w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Jackie Goldschneider displayed visible, palpable regret after she touched on a sore subject.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The representative then praised Bethenny, though that is arguably all part of the job.</p>



<p>&#8220;She is very engaged and connected to her audience,&#8221; the statement proclaimed.</p>



<p>The representative then concluded: &#8220;Bethenny wishes Jackie well on her personal and business journey!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bethenny Frankel is talking to Ellen DeGeneres from the comfort of her home in this photograph.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We might humbly suggest that Jackie did not bring this up with Bethenny in the past because she was at a different place in life.</p>



<p>First, so many of us seldom notice the malice that seems baked into the world around us. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism. And yes, the promotion of disordered eating.</p>



<p>It all seems so casual that it&#8217;s easy to not notice it until it impacts you, personally. That&#8217;s why we all need to learn about what others experience. Systemic change begins with awareness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Secondly, when you&#8217;re in the throes of disordered eating, messages promoting unhealthy habits can seem like &#8220;common sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jackie likely ignored, agreed with, or even echoed these toxic sentiments about extreme weight loss. </p>



<p>Unlearning that is part of the process. Then, you start to notice it all around you. And, in Jackie&#8217;s case, that means using her platform to call it out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>We have all felt encouragement while watching <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/jackie-goldschneider-is-making-strides-battling-eating-disorder-im-not-there-yet/">Jackie Goldschneider make strides in her recovery from disordered eating</a>.</p>



<p>That does not mean that she has been front and center on <em>RHONJ</em>, however.</p>



<p>A very credible report says that Jackie is receiving a demotion to a &#8220;Friend of&#8221; role.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, newcomer Rachel Fuda will be taking her place as a Full Housewife.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/08/31/rhonj-season-13-newbie-rachel-fuda-replaces-jackie-goldschneider/"><em>Page Six</em> reports</a> that, per multiple inside sources, Rachel Fuda will star on Season 13.</p>



<p>Fellow newbie Danielle Cabral is also adding her name to the lineup.</p>



<p>Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Jennifer Aydin, Dolores Catania, and Margaret Josephs are all returning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Jackie Goldschneider is not, this report explains, leaving the series.</p>



<p>Instead, she is appearing as a &#8220;Friend&#8221; of the Housewives this season.</p>



<p>To be fair, she is a friend of some of them. But it sounds like her demotion may be a recent development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>See, this decision went down in the wake of Season 13 filming.</p>



<p>Principal photography on RHONJ wrapped &#8220;a few weeks ago,&#8221; the report details.</p>



<p>Danielle Cabral was <em>always </em>clearly a Full Housewife during filming, insiders dish.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, the status of <em>three </em>of the women remained unclear for a while.</p>



<p>Apparently, Bravo thrust them into a winner-take-all, dog-eat-dog drama fest to see who came out on top.</p>



<p>Those women were Jackie Goldschneider, Rachel Fuda, and Jennifer &#8220;Jenn&#8221; Fessler &#8220;competed&#8221; for Full Housewife status.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="420" height="310" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-awkwardly-enrages-teresa-giudice.gif" alt="Jackie Goldschneider Awkwardly Enrages Teresa Giudice" class="wp-image-321931"/><figcaption>The Real Housewives of New Jersey stars respond with absolute horror as Jackie Goldschneider brings up Teresa Giudice&#8217;s husband&#8217;s incarceration in her effort to prove a point.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jenn is a fellow newcomer, even though it should be a <em>crime </em>for two Housewives on the same show to share a first name.</p>



<p>(Maybe <em>crime </em>is an overstatement, but either get a nickname or move to a new city! I&#8217;m not kidding!)</p>



<p>Notably, at least one source said that the cast always knew that Jenn Fessler was destined for a Friend role.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>After the season wrapped and the dust settled, Bravo made the call.</p>



<p>Rachel Fuda, the bigwigs decided, would usurp Jackie&#8217;s role.</p>



<p>At least, that&#8217;s what the report says. <em>Officially</em>, Bravo says that nothing is set in stone just yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs, Dolores Catania, Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Aydin. Those are the Real Housewives and this is their world. Everyone else is just living in it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re part of the Jack-Jack-Jackie Hive and feel a crawling sense of despair, don&#8217;t panic.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a &#8220;Friend&#8221; role means only appearing in three episodes, like a relative visiting from out of town.</p>



<p>But the report shares that Jackie and the other Friends filmed all season and are &#8220;featured heavily&#8221; in the Season 13 storylines.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jackie Goldschneider smiles here and poses for the camera. She shared this photo on Instagram.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, insiders seem to be at odds about how Jackie feels about this demotion.</p>



<p>One source says that she feels &#8220;unhappy&#8221; about Bravo&#8217;s decision.</p>



<p>Another affirms that she &#8220;feels great about her season.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Teresa Giudice, Jackie Goldschneider, and Melissa Gorga go to war on part two of The Real Housewives of New Jersey reunion. </figcaption></figure>



<p>That same second insider went on to claim that Jackie is happy to focus upon other things going on in her life right now.</p>



<p>The second one has the vibe of someone putting on a brave face, right?</p>



<p>Either way, it will be interesting to see how this casting upset impacts Season 13. We all know that even small changes can have dire consequences.</p>

<p>Last year, a tearful <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/jackie-goldschneider-sobs-after-her-kids-notice-her-disordered-e/">Jackie Goldschneider opened up about her disordered eating</a>.</p>



<p>Her biggest worry at the time was that her children had noticed her habits &#8212; and might internalize them.</p>



<p>Now, the <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> star is giving fans an update.</p>



<p>Jackie is &#8220;in active recovery&#8221; from her life-threatening disorder &#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean that she&#8217;s &#8220;cured.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Jackie Goldschneider spoke <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1338625/rhonjs-jackie-goldschneider-details-her-active-recovery-from-eating-disorder">to <em>E! News</em></a> about the eating disorder that has haunted her for the past two decades.</p>



<p>She fully admitted that she &#8220;would not call myself recovered yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jackie then detailed: &#8220;It&#8217;s been about a full year that I&#8217;ve been in active recovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My relationship with food is so much better,&#8221; Jackie shared encouragingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she then acknowledged, &#8220;not nearly where I need it to be.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is always encouraging when someone has a realistic idea of where they are in a recovery process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs, Dolores Catania, Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Aydin. Those are the Real Housewives and this is their world. Everyone else is just living in it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jackie offered details about her day-to-day habits.</p>



<p>She shared that she is generally eating a lot more, but that there are exceptions.</p>



<p>Jackie did share that she follows &#8220;rules that make me feel secure and safe when I&#8217;m eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>It can be odd to think about someone setting &#8220;rules&#8221; for themselves when eating unless it&#8217;s an allergy concern.</p>



<p>But there are signs of this disordered behavior everywhere.</p>



<p>Ever notice calorie counts on menus? Now imagine that fixating on calories is only one component of unhealthy habits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="757" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-1024x757.png" alt="Jackie Goldschneider Has Regrets" class="wp-image-317996" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-1024x757.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-300x222.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-768x568.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-735x543.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-335x248.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-347x257.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-520x384.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-640x473.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets-960x710.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-has-regrets.png 1066w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Jackie Goldschneider displayed visible, palpable regret after she touched on a sore subject.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Jackie&#8217;s therapist and nutritionist are hoping that she can move past the rules.</p>



<p>In the future, she will hopefully be able to eat intuitively.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not there yet,&#8221; Jackie confessed during the interview.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jackie Goldschneider smiles here and poses for the camera. She shared this photo on Instagram.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I try to recognize my hunger cues and eat according to them,&#8221; Jackie described.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she continued, she tries to &#8220;stop when I&#8217;m not hungry anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jackie admitted: &#8220;But I&#8217;m not to the point where I feel comfortable honoring hunger cues all day without a set limit.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;The bigger issue for me is how I feel about my body,&#8221; Jackie elaborated.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to get to a much better place with that,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>



<p>That, too, is a work in progress as she wears the right clothing for this scorching summer heat.</p>

<p>Jackie also praised the support that fans have sent her way since she spoke about her eating disorder on <em>RHONJ</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The amount of people who have reached out and told me it helped them was amazing,&#8221; she gushed. </p>



<p>Jackie added: &#8220;It is clearly my purpose on the show.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this season of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, <a href="/videos/melissa-gorga-jennifer-aydin-is-fake-and-ill-never-respect-her/">Jennifer Aydin has been</a> at the center of conflict.</p>
<p>She has clashed with Melissa Gorga. She has clashed with Margaret Josephs.</p>
<p>Even the husbands are part of this <em>Real Housewives</em> feud, and faction lines are being drawn.</p>
<p>After Jennifer called out Bill for not defending her, he spoke up for her &#8212; and ended up storming away from Joe Gorga and Evan Goldschneider.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On this week&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, Jennifer Aydin was still fuming over her husband.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&#8217;t about his affair a decade ago &#8212; at least, not directly.</p>
<p>Instead, as she griped to Dolores Catania after a workout, it was about how he didn&#8217;t defend her.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jennifer had called Melissa&#8217;s husband, Joe, a &quot;little bitch girl&quot; during the previous episode, which did not go over well with Melissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Bill was a f&#8211;king p&#8211;sy,&rdquo; she complained to Dolores on Tuesday&#8217;s episode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m f&#8211;king mad at Bill,&rdquo; she confirmed.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;He just stood there and said nothing,&quot; Jennifer characterized.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s just, I would&rsquo;ve liked something,&quot; she explained of her frustrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For 10 years, I&rsquo;ve been putting him on a f&#8211;king pedestal,&quot; Jennifer described.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;If I saw people ganging up on him, I would&rsquo;ve been like, &lsquo;With all due respect, if you disrespect my wife, you disrespect me,&#8217;&quot; Jennifer told Dolores.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s already betrayed me once,&quot; she said, a clear reference to his past cheating.</p>
<p>&quot;And now,&quot; Jennifer argued, &quot;here he is, he&rsquo;s doing it again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jennifer did speak to Bill about it.</p>
<p>He pointed out that she clearly wanted it both ways &#8212; for him to not wade into their battles, but for him to also support her.</p>
<p>To some degree, Bill took that to heart as he met up with the guys towards the end of the episode.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Guys night included Joe Gorga, Evan, Tiki, Joe Benigino, and Frank.</p>
<p>The first Joe stirred up a mess by writing &quot;f&#8211;k you&quot; to Bill in the group chat when the dinner was being planned.</p>
<p>Before heading out to meet them, Bill quipped: &quot;Obviously, Joe Gorga brings the girl drama into boys&#8217; night.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>When Bill first arrived, he joked &quot;Am I invited to this, I don&#8217;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>He was, in fact, invited.</p>
<p>In fact, Bill already had an outspoken ally in the group.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Even before his arrival, Tiki Barber had asked the others to not lay into him over Jennifer&#8217;s drama.</p>
<p>&quot;When men go through what he&#8217;s going through, other dudes need to have his back,&quot; Tiki suggested.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;The last thing he needs is for us to go kick his ass again.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I try not to get into her woman drama,&quot; Bill asserted as the obviously dramatic topics came up.</p>
<p>&quot;Your wife is out of control,&quot; Joe warned him, and he did not stop there.</p>
<p>&quot;She does a lot of things, bro. Jen got dirty and disgusting,&quot; he continued. &quot;I think she crossed that line.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Obviously, Bill couldn&#8217;t just ignore that, and tried to defend Jennifer, who was not present.</p>
<p>He argued that, unlike some of the cast, Jennifer didn&#8217;t go delving into other people&#8217;s business on purpose.</p>
<p>This led to him clashing with Evan Goldschneider</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;You don&#8217;t think that Margaret crossed that line digging for my secret,&quot; Bill protested.</p>
<p>He insisted: &quot;Jen, never went digging for anyone&#8217;s dirt.&quot;</p>
<p>Evan snapped back: &quot;Yes, she did.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We may disagree but she did not,&quot; Bill disputed. &quot;People can be nosy.&quot;</p>
<p>Evan doubled down: &quot;She is trying to find stuff to hurt individual people.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t stop there, accusing: &quot;That&#8217;s not a good person.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;If you think that way, I don&#8217;t think we can see eye to eye,&quot; Bill said.</p>
<p>Unwilling to sit and listen to his wife be insulted, he stood up and walked away.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m done. I&#8217;m done,&quot; Bill said as he fled from the guys&#8217; night turned guys&#8217; nightmare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, <a href="/videos/jennifer-aydin-i-caught-my-husband-cheating-the-day-before-i-gav/">Jennifer Aydin&#8217;s painful past</a> took center stage for much of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night&#8217;s new episode, it was Jackie Goldschneider&#8217;s turn to give a tearful confession.</p>
<p>Sitting at an early meal with her husband, she spoke very frankly about her history of disordered eating.</p>
<p>When her husband mentioned that their children had begun to notice, Jackie broke down crying.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On Season 12, Episode 3 of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, Jackie Goldschneider was dining with her husband, Evan.</p>
<p>While Evan ate, Jackie very conspicuously had no food of her own.</p>
<p>This was not a coincidence, she confessed &#8212; she had chosen this time to meet so that she would have an &quot;excuse&quot; to not eat.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I was at death&#8217;s doorstep,&quot; Jackie described of her past, when her body was practically skeletal.</p>
<p>She noted how her recovery had felt like being &quot;cured,&quot; but admitted that this was not the case.</p>
<p>Jackie added that she had lost weight due to a slight relapse, in part brought on by how hard of a time she&#8217;d had on Season 11.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I did shut down a little and I lost a few pounds,&quot; Jackie admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she acknowledged, &quot;it shouldn&#8217;t make me happy to be underweight.&quot;</p>
<p>Evan strongly agreed, his voice showing obvious concern for his wife&#8217;s health.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>When Jackie explained that she had brought them out early so that she would have an excuse to not eat, Evan spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s not good,&quot; he said, shaking his head. &quot;That&#8217;s not living.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, but my eating is so ritualized,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;I eat the same s&#8211;t over and over.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Salad after salad after salad,&quot; Jackie characterized her ritualized meals.</p>
<p>Many groups of people may have ritualized ways of eating &#8212; preparing food the same ways at the same times, including those with ADHD or the autistic spectrum.</p>
<p>This is also common in those with disordered eating. Whether they&#8217;re eating or not eating, it&#8217;s about control.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Even then revealed to Jackie that their kids, 13-year-old twins Jonas and Adin and 11-year-old twins Alexis and Hudson, &quot;have noticed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No they haven&#8217;t!&quot; a visibly and audibly upset Jackie responded.</p>
<p>&quot;Within the last year, they&rsquo;ve mentioned it several times,&rdquo; Evan countered. &ldquo;They said, &lsquo;Why is Mom eating the same dinner every night?&rsquo;&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Evan shared how he had responded: &quot;I said, &lsquo;Just let her be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackie&#8217;s voice almost immediately began to crack as she realized that her kids were old enough to pick up on this.</p>
<p>Many people inherit disordered eating from parents &#8212; some from abuse, others simply from observing a parent&#8217;s private habits.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jackie made it clear that her greatest fear is for this to impact her children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing if I do it to myself, but it&rsquo;s another thing if I make my kids think that it&rsquo;s normal behavior,&rdquo; Jackie lamented.</p>
<p>She expressed how afraid she is of food and of gaining weight while holding Evan&#8217;s hand.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m afraid that I&#8217;m going to relapse and kill myself,&quot; Jackie tearfully confessed. &quot;I just don&#8217;t want to do this anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Evan pleaded with her to see a professional, and after apologizing for having shut him down in the past, she agreed.</p>
<p>He was overjoyed that she was &quot;opening up,&quot; vowing to help her every step of the way. &quot;You&#8217;re my partner; if you hurt, I hurt.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been almost a year, but <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> fans have not forgotten.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/03/teresa-giudice-vs-jackie-goldschneider-the-feud-gets-really-ugly/">Jackie Goldschneider and Teresa Giudice had a bitter feud</a> over rumors that threatened Jackie&#8217;s marriage.</p>
<p>Things spun out of control and then died down, but there were rumors that the Goldschneiders ended up splitting for real.</p>
<p>Jackie says that it&#8217;s not the case, and explains how she protects her children from this dark side of fame.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jackie Goldschneider opened up to In Touch Weekly about where things stand with her family.</p>
<p>First of all, she affirmed that her relationship with her husband, Evan Goldschneider, is &quot;definitely&quot; secure.</p>
<p>She also explained how there are verbal and nonverbal ways of ensuring that their children don&#8217;t buy into the rumors.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;We both promise them that mommy and daddy love each other so much,&quot; Jackie noted. &quot;I think that comforts them.&quot;</p>
<p>With the Season 12 premiere airing on Tuesday, February 1, we are again reminded that TV doesn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Even if her kids don&#8217;t watch the show, their classmates or their families might. Safeguarding against that starts at home.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the little things that they see when we&rsquo;re not directly directing it toward them,&quot; Jackie explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Like, when they see us kiss on the way out the door,&quot; she detailed. &quot;They see us holding hands when we&rsquo;re walking.&quot;</p>
<p>Jackie went on: &quot;Those little things, let them know that mommy and daddy truly love each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jackie and Evan have been married since 2006 and have two sets of twins.</p>
<p>Jonas and Adin are 13. Alexis and Hudson are 11.</p>
<p>Those years can be vulnerable times when it comes to self esteem and peer interaction, but they know that their family isn&#8217;t falling apart.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Season 11 was easy for them, however.</p>
<p>When Teresa was spreading (sorry, &quot;repeating&quot;) a rumor that Evan was having some wild affair, things got ugly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that it was painful for Jackie. It was embarrassing for Evan to be dragged into that nonsense.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jackie explained that she decided that Season 11 would be off limits for her kids. She watched it alone as it aired.</p>
<p>Additionally, she and Evan resolved to be &quot;proactive&quot; about when it came to their kids hearing about what went on that season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to explain to them what they might hear,&quot; Jackie noted, &quot;what happened on the show.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And,&quot; Jackie declared, &quot;we had to assure them that none of it was true.&quot;</p>
<p>She affirmed: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want them thinking anything about their father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&rsquo;t want anyone taking these rumors and running with it as a way of teasing the kids,&quot; Jackie added. &quot;I also didn&rsquo;t want them to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Despite all of that, Jackie shared that she doesn&#8217;t wish Teresa any ill will in her own love life.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, Teresa is engaged to Luis &quot;Louie&quot; Ruelas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he treats her well and truly his past is in the past, then I can only hope that they remain as in love as they are right now,&rdquo; Jackie expressed charitably.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst Teresa and Jackie&#8217;s bitter feud on The Real Housewives of New Jersey this season, <a href="/videos/gia-giudice-praised-for-advising-teresa-to-apologize-shes-the-ma/">Gia Giudice received well-deserved praise</a> for her maturity.</p>
<p>But handling a situation with maturity does not mean that it did not impact her life &#8211; or that there were no consequences of Jackie&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p>If you missed it, Jackie&#8217;s irresponsible &quot;analogy&quot; name-dropped Gia in front of an audience of millions.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It set Teresa off, for sure, but that much was entirely predictable. What you might not know was that it made Gia&#8217;s life harder in real ways.</p>
<p>And <em>yeah</em>, she was mad about it.</p>
<p>Gia Giudice spoke to Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live about the now-infamous incident.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bravo aired a teaser for the &quot;The Real Housekids of Bravo&quot; special, which will air on May 9.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we do not have to wait those nearly two weeks to see Gia speak her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, like, completely disgusted by it,&rdquo; Gia confessed in the clip that we have included.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>She was referring of course to Jackie Goldschneider&#8217;s massive retaliation for Teresa&#8217;s repeating of a rumor about Jackie&#8217;s husband.</p>
<p>At the time, Jackie voiced an analogy involving an untrue claim of Gia doing cocaine in bathrooms at college parties.</p>
<p>Gia admitted: &ldquo;I never thought my name would ever be brought up.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;And especially just like being on the show for so long,&quot; she remarked about her lengthy reality career.</p>
<p>Gia pointed out that &quot;no Housewife has ever disrespected me.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one person to ever use my name in a poor manner,&quot; Gia responded grimly.</p>
<p>She expressed: &quot;I was like, in shock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jackie did apologize &#8230; but Gia revealed that she reached out to Jackie, not the other way around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, honestly, reached out to her,&rdquo; Gia shared.</p>
<p>She explained that she reached out &ldquo;because I had complaints from my sorority.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Gia shared: &quot;I was almost put in a meeting because they wanted to make sure I was okay.&quot;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with how so many aspects of college life go, that is very believable.</p>
<p>The context of the claim doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Gia&#8217;s name was brought up in a negative way on national television, for pretty much no reason.</p>
<p>Many universities err on the side of caution when it comes to what they hear about students.</p>
<p>This means that someone speaking irresponsibly of a student can have real ramifications to their lives.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>So yes, Jackie made Gia&#8217;s real life uncomfortable just to &quot;make a point&quot; to Teresa.</p>
<p>&quot;I dealt with a lot of things because of this analogy,&quot; Gia acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she added, &quot;I made her very aware of that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;And then, following that, she did apologize,&quot; Gia stated.</p>
<p>&quot;And then,&quot; Gia recalled, &quot;she did her Twitter apology.&quot;</p>
<p>She continued: &quot;which I did&hellip;I, like, I thought it was alright.&quot;</p>
<p>Gia then added: &quot;But it wasn&rsquo;t anything too crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest here: The public tweet to which Gia referred was a less than complete apology.</p>
<p>&quot;My analogy about Gia was simply an analogy &#8211; there was no truth to it of course,&quot; Jackie wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest of the cast understood this,&quot; she added, &quot;which you&rsquo;ll see in the coming weeks.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;The behavior at my husband&rsquo;s birthday party is truly unfortunate,&quot; Jackie went on to insist.</p>
<p>She concluded her tweet by writing &quot;destroying a marriage and family is not entertainment.&quot;</p>
<p>In general, apology tweets should include the apology, not doubling down on your outrage.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>At the time, Gia tweeted publicly: &ldquo;Saying it was an analogy is making it excusable, it&rsquo;s not.&quot;</p>
<p>She lamented that as a result of Jackie&#8217;s antics, &quot;My character is now being questioned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name was used to make a point,&quot; Gia noted.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;No one should be used in that way,&quot; Gia&#8217;s tweet continued at the time, criticizing the behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;I am suffering the consequences for such an outlandish and untrue statement,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>Gia concluded: &quot;While her marriage is happy &amp; intact.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Bottom line:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t allege someone&#8217;s college-aged kid does coke in the bathroom, even if you&#8217;re being facetious.</p>
