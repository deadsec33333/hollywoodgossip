<p>Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore have an enviable host-for-host friendship.</p>



<p>They also have corresponding tattoos.</p>



<p>Not everyone likes <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/martha-stewart-shoves-drew-barrymore-after-cringeworthy-petting-attempt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrymore&#8217;s brand of friendliness</a>, but she and Guthrie share a special bond.</p>



<p>And now they&#8217;ve gotten tattooed together &#8212; again.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/10/entertainment/savannah-guthrie-celebrated-her-no-1-book-by-getting-more-ink-with-drew-barrymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a></em> reports that, last week, Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore received tattoos together.</p>



<p>According to inside sources, Guthrie appeared for a taping of Barrymore&#8217;s daytime talk show. She has appeared as a guest before. The episode airs Tuesday, March 11.</p>



<p>The report reveals that Barrymore and Guthrie got inked on camera.</p>

<p>Apparently, Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore were celebrating the former&#8217;s recent success.</p>



<p>Guthrie&#8217;s new Christian children&#8217;s book, Mostly What God Does Is Love You, has reached Number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list.</p>



<p>With over 20,000 copies sold, she and Barrymore decided to mark the occasion with celebratory tattoos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-tattooed-savannah-guthrie-and-drew-barrymore">Who tattooed Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore?</h2>



<p>JonBoy is a celebrity tattoo artist. A very appropriate choice to tattoo two famous women on TV.</p>



<p>Guthrie received hearts based upon her children&#8217;s drawings, while Barrymore received the word &#8220;time.&#8221; </p>



<p>So no, they are not matching tattoos. </p>



<p>They each hold special meaning, but they went under the needle together. That&#8217;s cute!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It has only been a couple of years since Guthrie and Barrymore received tattoos together in 2023.</p>



<p>However, the two were not on camera for this moment. They only shared the results on <em>The Today Show</em> after the fact.</p>



<p>But when it&#8217;s <em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em>, the eponymous host can choose what they air, whether it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/drew-barrymore-the-talk-even-bill-maher-reverse-scab-plans-amidst-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scabbing</a> during a writer&#8217;s strike or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/drew-barrymore-angela-deem-90-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewing terrible people</a> or a cute tattoo session.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-these-two-have-a-beautiful-friendship">These two have a beautiful friendship</h2>



<p>Tattoos can sometimes be controversial. </p>



<p>There is a sickness in our society where many people feel the need to control others&#8217; bodies.</p>



<p>However, Guthrie and Barrymore have gotten tattoos to mark important milestones and as tributes to loved ones. That&#8217;s sweet!</p>



<p>Hopefully, most viewers won&#8217;t be too weird about this very sweet moment.</p>

<p>Welp. </p>



<p>That was awkward.</p>



<p>On the November 12 edition of The Drew Barrymore, the host welcomed guest Martha Stewart, who has been in the news of late due to a documentary about her life that includes such bombshells as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/martha-stewart-shocker-i-cheated-on-my-husband/">Stewart having cheated on her husband</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="624" height="374" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/91981733-14072921-image-a-159_1731423316330-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513147" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/91981733-14072921-image-a-159_1731423316330-copy.jpg 624w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/91981733-14072921-image-a-159_1731423316330-copy-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martha Stewart appears here as a guest on The Drew Barrymore Show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (The Drew Barrymore Show)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In this latest instance, the 83-year old was honored by Barrymore as the &#8220;original&#8221; influencer&#8230; and then things got weird.</p>



<p>At one point, Barrymore bit her finger and asked Martha: &#8220;What makes you soft and gooey?&#8221;</p>



<p>Uhhh, &#8220;soft and gooey treatment,&#8221; Stewart eventually replied, clearly confused by the very confusing query.</p>



<p>&#8220;Soft and gooey treatment?&#8217; Barrymore repeated, prior to leaning over and trying to caress her guest&#8217;s arm while asking: &#8220;When you&#8217;re treated like a lady?&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513150" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2181838206-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martha Stewart attends the 2024 WWD Honors at Cipriani South Street on October 29, 2024 in New York City.<br> <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dominik Bindl/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The cringeworthy moment culminated with Stewart full-on shoving Barrymore aside and telling her &#8220;You&#8217;re the wrong gender!&#8221;</p>



<p>Barrymore fell back dramatically on to the sofa at last and said &#8220;I know, I know&#8221; prior to one of Barrymore&#8217;s dogs running up on stage and creating a much-needed distraction.</p>



<p>&#8220;As much as we&#8217;re here to honor you today, I want to thank you also for honoring every person that you&#8217;ve influenced in the world too,&#8221; Barrymore added, trying to save the moment.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s gone viral nonetheless.</p>

<p>Barrymore is no stranger to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/drew-barrymore-angela-deem-90-day/">unusual guest interactions</a>.</p>



<p>Last December, the occasional actress was blasted as &#8220;clingy, creepy, and cringe&#8221; for touching Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s arm during an interview.</p>



<p>More recently, her interview technique was branded as &#8220;invasive&#8221; over social media and by uncomfortable viewers after she sat EXTREMELY close to Austin Butler on the couch.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point,&#8221; Barrymore admitted to Entertainment Tonight in August.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself I like to be around people. It&#8217;s not everyone&#8217;s favorite, but I&#8217;m sorry to those people.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that first of all we&#8217;re always gonna be big on joy and laughter and feeling good, and that was something I always wanted to do, but I never thought we would launch in a pandemic, and trying to lean into the joy and the feel good and the comedy at that time was real weird and wacky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew Barrymore should be better than this.</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/drew-barrymore-the-talk-even-bill-maher-reverse-scab-plans-amidst-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drew Barrymore&#8217;s scabbing during the strikes</a> alienated a lot of now-former fans. Not to mention her show&#8217;s writers.</p>



<p>Now, she&#8217;s hemorrhaging more fans. And she&#8217;s losing respect in the process.</p>



<p>Having <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/angela-deem-screams-in-liz-woods-face-on-90-day-the-last-resort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>90 Day Fiance</em> villain Angela Deem</a> as a talk show guest has set a new low for her talk show.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-angela-deem-has-a-toxic-brand-and-that-s-bad-news-for-drew-barrymore">Angela Deem has a toxic brand, and that&#8217;s bad news for Drew Barrymore</h2>



<p>Recently, the despicable <em>90 Day Fiance</em> star appeared on <em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em> as a guest.</p>



<p>This catastrophic error has left Drew&#8217;s fans feeling downright disgusted &#8212; not to mention surprised and confused.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t a good look for Ross Matthews, either. But since Drew has her name on the show, she&#8217;s the one who seems tainted by Angela&#8217;s malodorous vibes.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Even when <em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em> shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8UiUwluWYq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> reel of Angela Deem&#8217;s appearance on the show, the comments were full of fully justified outrage.</p>



<p>It was not merely that people expressed their unwavering loathing of Angela as a human being and as an &#8220;entertainer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Commenters also expressed their disappointment that Drew Barrymore, who has <em>so many</em> fans, would sully herself with Angela&#8217;s (metaphorically) fetid presence.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-90-day-fiance-fans-hate-angela-deem">Why do &#8217;90 Day Fiance&#8217; fans hate Angela Deem?</h2>



<p>Angela would like to see herself as a funny, unpredictable &#8220;meemaw&#8221; who&#8217;s been unlucky in love and, perhaps, is a little too trusting.</p>



<p>The truth is she&#8217;s among the worst kinds of reality star, who&#8217;s behavior is abhorrent. (Not just our word; unsurprisingly, the adjective &#8220;abhorrent&#8221; cropped up in a lot Instagram comments on Drew&#8217;s page.)</p>



<p><em>90 Day Fiance</em> fans who describe Angela as abusive aren&#8217;t referring to the contents of police reports or accusations. The show itself has captured her treatment of her husband &#8212; including destroying his property to <a href="https://screenrant.com/worst-things-90-day-fiance-angela-said-michael/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verbally</a> accosting him to <a href="https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-michael-makes-jaw-dropping-claims-angela/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physically attacking</a> him.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not all. </p>



<p>As recently as August of 2023, video recorded <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/angela-deem-screams-and-attacks-other-woman-at-hotel-because-thats-what-she-does/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Angela Deem attacking and beating a woman</a> in a hotel lobby. Even when she <em>knows </em>that she&#8217;s on TLC&#8217;s cameras, Angela unleashes her fury upon castmates. It&#8217;s not entertainment; it&#8217;s signs of a serious problem. And, in some cases, it&#8217;s likely a crime.</p>



<p>Despite her alleged desire to be liked, her behavior has been nothing short of rancid. For viewers to see Drew invite Angela onto her show and greet her as if she were merely a relatable reality TV personality was &#8230; disquieting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-we-be-angry-with-drew-barrymore">Should we be angry with Drew Barrymore?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s definitely a complex question. How much power does she have over the guest lineup on her show?</p>



<p>In this case, social media posts seem to suggest that this ill-advised guest spot was a favor to Ross Matthews. Allegedly, his husband is a big fan of Angela&#8217;s. (There is no accounting for taste.)</p>



<p>Truth be told, we cannot reasonably expect Drew to personally vet every single guest on her own show.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-1024x576.png" alt="Angela Deem on The Drew Barrymore Show in 2024." class="wp-image-502281" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0618_angeladeem_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">For unknown reasons, The Drew Barrymore Show invited 90 Day Fiance villain Angela Deem as a guest in June of 2024.

<p>But, as countless commenters pointed out, almost anyone else from <em>90 Day Fiance</em> would have been a better choice. Even if they don&#8217;t have the whole <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/michael-ilesanmi-missing-90-day-fiance-star-angela-deem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">situation with Michael Ilesanmi</a> going for them.</p>



<p>Obviously, they could do worse, like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/geoffrey-paschel-appeals-conviction-the-court-shouldnt-have-heard-from-my-other-victims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">convicted abuser Geoffrey Paschel</a> if he weren&#8217;t rotting behind bars where he belongs. But while &#8220;<em>90 Day</em> stars worse than Angela&#8221; is a short list, the vast majority of them really are just normal people with interesting stories.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to suggest that producers were looking to court controversy for ratings. But it&#8217;s equally likely that, on the surface, Angela just seems like an ill-behaved grandmother who makes people laugh. The true fault lies with TLC and Sharp for continuing to treat her like an employable reality star and not a monster.</p>

<p>This summer, we have witnessed entertainment industry event that the world has not seen in generations.</p>



<p>Both the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/timothee-chalamet-has-spent-sag-aftra-strike-with-kylie-jenner-will-it-last-after-amptp-offers-fair-deal/">WGA and SAG-AFTRA are striking</a> amidst unthinkable corporate cheating. Executives are paying themselves tens of millions, while using streaming loopholes to pay minuscule residuals to the people who <em>actually make</em> TV and film.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unsustainable. And there are many other issues that desperately need addressing.</p>



<p>Amidst all of this, a few clowns decided to resume their shows &#8212; <em>scabbing </em>during the strike. Sadly, Drew Barrymore was among them. Now, at least, she has reversed course and offered a heartfelt apology.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-please-don-t-scab">Please, don&#8217;t scab</h2>



<p>Last week, <em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em> resumed &#8212; an apparent violation of the work stoppage.</p>



<p>Years ago, talk shows could continue in some form during strikes, lining the pockets of networks without their usual content. Those rules have since changed.</p>



<p>Reports came out, describing Barrymore&#8217;s security expelling studio audience members who wore strike-related materials.</p>

<p>Simply put, the whole point of any sort of strike &#8212; such as the one that America&#8217;s courageous auto workers recently authorized &#8212; is for the people who actually create goods and services and art that generate profit to bargain collectively.</p>



<p>Only a small percentage of actors are millionaires or more. Even a smaller percentage of writers are. The vast majority of SAG-AFTRA actors don&#8217;t even make as much as your average first-year teacher.</p>



<p>People who create value should then receive financial compensation for their labor and ingenuity. But with massive companies obsessed with golden parachutes and stockholders, it has become a game of cheating them out of their due.</p>

<p>Crossing the picket line &#8212; literally or metaphorically &#8212; hurts strikers. It also, by extension, hurts most Americans. </p>



<p>So when Drew Barrymore, or <em>The Talk</em>, or whatever Bill Maher&#8217;s god-awful show is called &#8230; when they start filming despite a work stoppage, it helps these corporate behemoths to avoid paying people what they owe them.</p>



<p>In case anyone wondered how valuable actors and writers actually are, Warner Bros Discovery projected a loss of $500 million for 2023. That&#8217;s bad, even under Zaslav&#8217;s leadership. Agreeing to the guilds&#8217; terms would have cost a fraction of that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-one-was-rooting-for-maher">No one was rooting for Maher</h2>



<p>Long story short, it <em>sucked </em>to hear that Barrymore was filming with scabs instead of her own writers. People felt disappointed in her.</p>



<p><em>Everyone </em>expected this from Maher. He is a notoriously awful person who will almost invariably take the wrong stance on most issues.</p>



<p>The backlash was intense. And while it was a great opportunity to dunk on Maher, it was a time to bite the bullet and call out Barrymore.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-apologies-a-hit-and-a-miss">Two apologies: a hit and a miss</h2>



<p>Late last week, she put out an apology &#8230; but did not signal her intent to change course. That was, obviously, not enough.</p>



<p>Now, Barrymore is showing that she has listened to and understood people&#8217;s concerns.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have listened to everyone, and I am making the decision to pause the show’s premiere until the strike is over,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram. Absolutely, it is a good thing that she has <em>listened</em>. We&#8217;re sure that many friends reached out to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no words to express my deepest apologies to anyone I have hurt,&#8221; Barrymore continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;And, of course,&#8221; Barrymore acknowledged, &#8220;to our incredible team who works on the show and has made it what it is today.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oddly, she wrote: &#8220;We really tried to find our way forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barrymore affirmed: &#8220;And I truly hope for a resolution for the entire industry very soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>Previously, she had explained that she was trying to resume work to save the jobs of other people. </p>



<p>For the record, other talk show hosts have formed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3YnUJC2alA6I1F2V7CdDa2">a podcast, <em>Strike Force Five</em></a><em>,</em> to earn money to pay their writers and crews. </p>

<p>Like we said, a lot of people felt disappointed in Drew Barrymore. Reversing course was the right thing to do, and it&#8217;s a relief.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s really a sign of the incredible upswell in public opinion is that <em>The Talk</em> and Bill Maher are also reacting to the backlash. Both halted plans to resume business as usual.</p>



<p>As many on social media observed, if Maher is caving, public pressure is an effective tool. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one group of people who can end these strikes, and they&#8217;re executives in charge of some of the biggest entertainment industry corporations on the planet.</p>



<p>Instead, many executives planned vacations for this year. Companies have pushed film releases to next year &#8212; to a post-strike time when actors can <em>promote </em>their projects.</p>



<p>They can end the strikes by agreeing to reasonable terms from SAG-AFTRA and the WGA. Instead, it appears from the outside that they&#8217;d rather continue to lose money out of spite.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2020/01/cameron-diaz-baby-new-mom-drew-barrymore-champagne-night-out-polo-lounge/">RadarOnline</a>&nbsp;</em>reports that the longtime friends and <em>Charlie&#8217;s Angels</em> alums were spotted partying at the Polo Lounge together.</p>
<p>&quot;Cameron and Drew and another lady were sitting in a booth near the bar,&quot; the insider reveals.</p>
<p>The spy divulges: &quot;and there was a bucket with champagne in ice next to them.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, clearly, Cameron has a lot to celebrate, and who better to celebrate by your side than a beloved and talented friend.</p>

<p>Of course, Cameron is a mom now on top of being in her mid-forties, so maybe she didn&#8217;t feel like staying up at all hours of the night.</p>
<p>&quot;It was early,&quot; the eyewtiness characterizes, &quot;about 6 p.m.&quot;</p>
<p>The source opines: &quot;They looked like they were having a great time.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re so happy for them that they were able to catch up. Countless new moms wish that they had the time and childcare resources to do the same.</p>

<p>Cameron Diaz stunned the world this month with a surprise announcement that she and her husband of five years, Benji Madden, are now parents.</p>
<p>&quot;We are so happy, blessed, and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter, Raddix Madden,&quot; she wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>Raddix sounds like a cool game, but does not quite pass the <em>run it by a group of cruel 12-year-old girls and see if they can tear it to shreds</em> test.</p>
<p>Cameron gushed: &quot;She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;While we are overjoyed to share this news,&quot; Cameron noted, &quot;we also feel a strong instinct to protect our little one&rsquo;s privacy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So we won&rsquo;t be posting or sharing any more details,&quot; she emphasized. Good.</p>
<p>At least, Cameron says that she won&#8217;t be sharing further information on her newborn &quot;other than the fact that she is really really cute!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some would even say RAD,&quot; she joked, adding a smiling emoticon to acknowledge her goofy pun.</p>

<p>Drew Barrymore isn&#8217;t Cameron&#8217;s only close friend who&#8217;s happy to see her so happy.</p>
<p>Most of us see Gwyneth Paltrow as either a joke or a snake-oil-peddling menace, but she and Cameron go way back.</p>
<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re very, very excited,&quot; Gwyneth gushed about her pal&#8217;s newfound role as a mother.</p>
<p>She predicted how Cameron will be as a mother: &quot;She&rsquo;s going to be the best.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Cameron and Joel completed an expansion on their home last year &#8212; which we now understand to have been to make room for their growing family.</p>
<p>We can absolutely understand why they chose to add on to the house rather than move.</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s in-laws, Joel Madden (Benji&#8217;s twin brother) and Nicole Richie live just a little over 100 feet away from the house.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sure that they&#8217;ll be happy to babysit, though given that Cameron is worth an estimated $140 million, she&#8217;ll never be lacking in childcare.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t seen Raddix ourselves yet, but in the mean time, we can simply guess what she might look like.</p>

<p>It sure seems like these reports are coming from thin air.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="381" height="348" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/jessica-alba-and-drew-barrymore-looking-great.png" alt="Jessica Alba And Drew Barrymore Looking Great" class="wp-image-232353" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/jessica-alba-and-drew-barrymore-looking-great.png 381w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/jessica-alba-and-drew-barrymore-looking-great-300x274.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/jessica-alba-and-drew-barrymore-looking-great-335x306.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/jessica-alba-and-drew-barrymore-looking-great-347x317.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Both Jessica Alba and Drew Barrymore are successful women.</p>
<p>They each have a string of hit movies, so this one was always a little odd and pretty unbelievable.</p>
<p>According to Star, Jessica Alba was not about to let Drew Barrymore become competition, so she &quot;flat-out refused to help.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see celebrities branch out, but they don&#8217;t always have to be arguing to get further. There is such a thing as going too far and it seems that&#8217;s exactly what has happened here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty crazy. They&#8217;re probably the least likely celebrities to become embroiled in a feud, so these &quot;reports&quot; do come as quite the shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew has done really well with her Flower Beauty brand and wants to expand,&rdquo; and &ldquo;with her recent divorce, she&rsquo;s more focused than ever on her kids, Olive and Frankie, so she figured baby products were the way to go,&rdquo; the source continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It all sounds pretty innocent on Drew&#8217;s part. They can both be successful, so all of this is a bitter pill to swallow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The claims got crazier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessica even scoffed at the idea that Drew&rsquo;s company could hold a candle to hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew was floored &mdash; she just wanted to pick Jessica&rsquo;s brain about a few ideas and thought moms stick together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a way to treat one of your best friends. There is such a thing as competition, but this just comes across as malicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sources confirmed to Gossip Cop that this <a href="http://www.gossipcop.com/jessica-alba-refuse-drew-barrymore-business-advice-baby-products/">DID NOT happen</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There we have it. It never happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will they announce a joint business venture next?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think about all of this?&nbsp;</p>
