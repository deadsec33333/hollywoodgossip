<p>Wait, did Kamala Harris prosecute Michael Jackson?</p>



<p>The intersection of politics and the celebrity world is always strange. And it&#8217;s not always in the form of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-says-shes-choosing-calm-over-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity endorsements</a>.</p>



<p>While disgraced former president <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-defended-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump has praised Diddy</a>, Janet Jackson is leveling <em>wild </em>allegations against Kamala Harris.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s claiming that Harris once prosecuted her late brother, Michael Jackson. And Harris is responding to the rumor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-doesn-t-janet-jackson-like-vice-president-kamala-harris">Why doesn&#8217;t Janet Jackson like Vice president Kamala Harris?</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, October 15, VP (and presidential candidate) Kamala Harris sat down for a <em>The Breakfast Club</em> interview.</p>



<p>Co-host Charlamagne Tha God brought up an alleged beef: &#8220;There&#8217;s a rumor that Janet Jackson is mad at you because you prosecuted her brother, the late, great Michael Jackson.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continued, inviting Harris to correct the record by adding: &#8220;That&#8217;s on the internet. Clear that up for people.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-1024x681.jpg" alt="Vice President Kamala Harris with Charlemagne the God on October 15, 2024." class="wp-image-511128" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-1080x718.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_01_charlemagnethegod-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris (L) and Charlamagne Tha God pose for a photo before &#8220;We The People: An Audio Townhall With Kamala Harris and Charlamagne Tha God&#8221; on October 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Aaron J. Thornton/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just not true,&#8221; Vice President Kamala Harris clarified.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Charlamagne Tha God acknowledged. That is an easy and silly claim to debunk, and prosecutions are a matter of public record. And Michael Jackson&#8217;s took place in a separate city.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I mean, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Harris admitted when Charlamagne Tha God asked about Janet Jackson&#8217;s apparent issue with her. &#8220;I have not talked to her. But certainly, it&#8217;s not true about her brother.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-vice-president-kamala-harris-once-prosecute-michael-jackson">Did Vice President Kamala Harris once prosecute Michael Jackson?</h2>



<p>Famously, in 2003, Michael Jackson went to court on charges of sexual abuse of children. This was not his first time facing allegations of child molestation.</p>



<p>The indictment went down in Santa Barbara. He faced seven charges of child molestation and two of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks.</p>



<p>In 2003, Kamala Harris won the election to be the district attorney &#8230; of San Francisco. She served in that role from 2004 until 2011. In case anyone is struggling with geography, San Francisco and Santa Barbara are different cities. They are well over 300 miles from each other.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-1024x695.jpg" alt="Michael Jackson during his trial stemming from his 2003 indictment." class="wp-image-511132" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-2048x1391.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-1080x733.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_kamalaharris_1016_michaeljackson-1200x815.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michael Jackson and his father Joseph Jackson depart the courthouse after listening to closing arguements in his child molestation trial at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse June 2, 2005 in Santa Maria, California.

<p>So, no, Kamala Harris had no involvement in the prosecution of Michael Jackson. If she had, the only <em>bad </em>thing about that would be that the prosecution of him was unsuccessful. No one would want to brag about failing to bring <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/michael-jackson-a-murky-legacy-10-years-after-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an accused monster</a> to justice.</p>



<p>However, Janet Jackson has said more about Kamala Harris than apparently confusing her with her late brother&#8217;s prosecutor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you know what they supposedly said? She&#8217;s not Black,&#8221; Jackson said in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/21/janet-jackson-interview-on-bad-relationships-new-music-and-kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bizarre and meandering interview</a> with <em>The Guardia</em>. in September. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I heard. That she&#8217;s Indian.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Janet Jackson on September 8, 2023." class="wp-image-511131" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1016_janetjackson_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janet Jackson attends the Christian Siriano SS24 Runway Show at The Pierre Hotel on September 08, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Christian Siriano)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-this-again">Not this again &#8230;</h2>



<p>Even the interviewer pointed out to Janet Jackson that Kamala Harris&#8217; mother is Indian and her father is Black.</p>



<p>&#8220;Her father&#8217;s white. That&#8217;s what I was told. I mean, I haven&#8217;t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white,&#8221; Jackson said bizarrely.</p>



<p>Just for the record, Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; father is Jamaican-American. He is a Black man. And while <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-drawn-to-conspiracy-theories-share-a-cluster-of-psychological-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy theorists exhibit a cluster of traits</a>, we don&#8217;t really know why Janet Jackson is spewing this kind of unhinged nonsense. We hope that she gets better soon.</p>

<p>In 2019, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/leaving-neverland-the-michael-jackson-documentarys-biggest-bombs/">sickening allegations in the <em>Leaving Neverland</em> documentary</a> reached many hearts and minds.</p>



<p>People who spent decades enjoying Michael Jackson&#8217;s music began to come to terms with the thought that their late, fallen hero could also be a life-ruining monster.</p>



<p>Of course, sex crimes &#8212; particularly those that took place decades ago &#8212; are notoriously difficult to prove in our court system.</p>



<p>Now, a Court of Appeals has ruled that one of his most well-known accusers will get to make his case in court. And he will not be the last. &#8230;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/06/26/michael-jackson-molestation-allegations-wade-robson-trial/"><em>TMZ </em>reports</a> that the California Court of Appeal has just opened (or reopened) the doors for choreographer Wade Robson.</p>



<p>For many years, he has hoped to not only tell the world about his childhood experiences with Michael Jackson, but to prove his case in a court of law.</p>



<p>As many of us are aware, Robson accuses the singer of childhood sexual abuse &#8212; from when he was 7 to when he was 14.</p>

<p>Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a criminal trial against Michael Jackson. He is deceased. The singer passed away in 2009, at which time he was already infamous.</p>



<p>Rather, Wade Robson is suing MJ&#8217;s corporation, MJJ Productions, Inc. That entity still exists.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s attorneys have argued that the company itself had no legal duty to protect Robson &#8212; or any of the other alleged victims. Why? Because it had no ability to control Michael Jackson while he was alive.</p>

He has earned this reputation. But his legacy is not so simple.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially, the trial court sided with the Michael Jackson Estate.</p>



<p>However, the Court of Appeal has issued a tentative ruling (a final ruling will follow, but will almost certainly be the same) to affirm that the case will go to trial.</p>



<p>This means that Wade Robson will have a chance to prove his case. Though, as we mentioned, he will have an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Robson came to the United States from Australia when he was a young boy.</p>



<p>At that time, he alleges, Jackson befriended him, taking him under his wing, and sexually preyed upon him.</p>



<p>Robson did not open up about these experiences at first. In fact, in 2005, he testified in MJ&#8217;s defense. At that time, he said that he had shared the singer&#8217;s bed as a child, but that nothing sexual or illegal had taken place.</p>

<p>In 2013, however, Robson came forward with his own allegations.</p>



<p>He said that he had testified on Jackson&#8217;s behalf after &#8220;complete manipulation and brainwashing.&#8221; The same sort of manipulative tactics that MJ allegedly used to gain and abuse his trust as a child.</p>



<p>Supporters of Robson say that it is very common for victims to defend their abusers. It happens with domestic violence, sexual abuse, cults, and more. Critics claim that Robson is after money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>We mentioned that Robson will not be the last. James Safecuck is a fellow accuser, and filed a similar lawsuit.</p>



<p>His case is before the same Court of Appeal. It seems very likely that he, too, will get to make his case at trial.</p>



<p>Again, we do not know how much success they will have within our legal system. Our hearts go out to all CSA survivors.</p>

<p>Things have always been complicated for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/michael-jackson-child-molestation-claims-family-finally-responds/">Michael Jackson&#8217;s surviving family</a>. They always will be.</p>



<p>Attorneys for MJ&#8217;s estate are taking serious aim at LaToya Jackson.</p>



<p>LaToya, of course is the sister of the late music legend. She is no stranger to the industry herself.</p>



<p>However, her memoir and its accusations against those running the estate have drawn their ire.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Sooo Sad! My heart goes out to #BobbiKristina the Brown &amp; Houston family and friends! May you #RIPBobbiKristina. We Will Always Love You!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Apparently, Michael Jackson&#8217;s estate lawyers have written a cease and desist.</p>



<p><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/latoya-jackson-cease-and-desist-michael-estate-2011-memoir-ex-fiance-jeffre-phillips/"><em>RadarOnline </em>got a hold</a> of the document, which attorney Howard Weitzman penned.</p>



<p>The legal letter targeted book publisher Simon and Schuster.</p>

The latter managed to convince Michael to go out to a bar like a &#8220;normal couple,&#8221; yet he changed his mind after a man accosted him on the street.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, LaToya released <em>Starting Over</em> 11 years ago &#8212; in 2011. She simultaneously published an accompanying EP by the same name.</p>



<p>She co-wrote the bombshell book with then-fiance Jeffre Phillips.</p>



<p>The book delved into the complex dynamics of the Jackson family, her late brother&#8217;s troubles, and her love for him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Both the book and the promotional tour left the estate <em>fuming</em>.</p>



<p>“In connection with the promotion of the book,&#8221; the cease and desist letter accused.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ms. Jackson has made repeated public statements accusing the Executors of murdering Michael,&#8221; the attorney wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Per her accusation, the alleged murder took place &#8220;in order to &#8216;steal&#8217; his music catalog.”</p>



<p>“We understand these same absurd accusations are included in the book,&#8221; the estate added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ms. Jackson has also made statements to the effect that John Branca [MJ’s other lawyer] stole $150 million from Michael Jackson,&#8221; the letter noted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the cease and desist went on, &#8220;hid it in an &#8216;offshore account.'&#8221;</p>



<p>“Even though you most certainly know this,&#8221; the cease and desist letter warned the publisher.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it does not appear that the estate (or any other party) actually filed a lawsuit over the memoir.</p>



<p>They would have had over a decade to do so. Perhaps their concerns were PR. Or perhaps the warning was simply enough.</p>



<p>The cease and desist has only come out now because Jeffre submitted it during his own ongoing legal battle with the estate. They accuse him of stealing MJ&#8217;s property during his final days of life. Oof.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than a month ago, Aaron Carter revealed that he is <a href="/2019/04/aaron-carter-im-finally-ready-to-share-my-truth-about-michael-ja/">ready to share his truth about Michael Jackson</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, Aaron had put Jackson&#8217;s accusers on blast. Only recently did he hint that he has his own story to tell.</p>
<p>In a new clip, Aaron accuses Michael of doing &quot;something inappropriate.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="507" height="410" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries.jpg" alt="Aaron Carter Cries" class="wp-image-271959" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries.jpg 507w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries-300x243.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries-335x271.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries-347x281.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" /><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>So Aaron Carter will appear on WEtv&#8217;s <em>Marriage Boot Camp Reality Stars Family Edition</em>, which continues to be a major mouthful.</p>
<p>In a newly released clip, Aaron speaks out about his experience with the controversial late King of Pop.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael was a really good guy, okay?&quot; Aaron begins in the short video.</p>
<p>Aaron does show that he has learned his lesson since earlier this year.</p>
<p>Instead of claiming virtiual omniscience over someone else&#8217;s character, Aaron wisely adds: &quot;As far as I know.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Really good guy,&quot; Aaron reiterates.</p>
<p>&quot;He never really, like &#8230;&quot; he continues. &quot;He never did anything inappropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except,&quot; Aaron reveals. &quot;For one time.&quot;</p>
<p>He adds: &quot;There was one thing that he did that was a little bit inappropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>That is, unfortunately, where this clip ends &#8212; which makes it a very serious teaser for the show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>Leaving Neverland</em> was a recent, harrowing documentary about Michael Jackson&#8217;s alleged sex crimes against minors.</p>
<p>Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who had previously defended Michael against the allegations when they were younger, came forward.</p>
<p>They related truly horrifying recollections of grooming behavior along with very explicit sex acts.</p>
<p>They spoke of financial manipulation of their families and how they were rewarded for alleged encounters with the late singer.</p>
<p>Even people who had defended Jackson in the past began to see the once-beloved singer in a new, grim light.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Initially, Aaron Carter was furious that his name was brought up in the conversation.</p>
<p>See, he had been close with the late King of Pop.</p>
<p>There had been rumors during his teenage years that he was one of Michael Jackson&#8217;s alleged victims.</p>
<p>Aaron lashed out Robson and Safechuck in defense of Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>But in April, he changed his tune, and hinted that he had an anecdote to share &#8230; but not yet.</p>
<p>And now, it appears that he&#8217;s ready to tell the world about his own experience.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So &#8230; real talk.</p>
<p>Aaron Carter has had a very difficult life. Mental and physical health issues in adulthood were preceded by childhood stardom.</p>
<p>(Many longtime fans believe that his family &#8212; and namely, his parents &#8212; did more harm than good)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see him getting therapy and getting work, even if it&#8217;s a little odd to see him get both in the form of a reality show.</p>
<p>Life is weird like that.</p>
<p>But &#8230; when the full video airs, what should we expect him to say?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We have to say that, were Aaron planning to tell the camera that he had a similar experience to Robson or Safechuck, he would use different phrasing.</p>
<p>Some people may defend those who preyed upon them, but you wouldn&#8217;t call an adult performing sex acts upon a child &quot;a little bit inappropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>Our guess is that Aaron is going to tell a story of what people might consider a red flag.</p>
<p>But it will probably pale in comparison to the bone-chilling stories that we&#8217;ve heard.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s our expectation. But hey, we could always be wrong.</p>
<p>Either way, we wish Aaron Carter the best. <em>Whatever</em> may have happened, it was not his fault.</p>

<p>The documentary <a href="/2019/03/paris-jackson-shocks-fans-with-drug-use-video-amid-leaving-never/"><em>Leaving Neverland</em></a> unearthed new evidence with regard to the child molestation claims about Jackson.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="787" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-787x1024.jpg" alt="King of Pop" class="wp-image-325597" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-787x1024.jpg 787w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-231x300.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-768x1000.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-1180x1536.jpg 1180w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-1574x2048.jpg 1574w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-735x957.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-257x335.jpg 257w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-267x347.jpg 267w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-400x520.jpg 400w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-492x640.jpg 492w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-590x768.jpg 590w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-738x960.jpg 738w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-830x1080.jpg 830w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/king-of-pop-scaled.jpg 1967w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Not surpsiringly, the effect on the singer&#8217;s legacy and estate has been considerable.</p>
<p>Jackson&#8217;s music has been banned from Canadian radio stations, and protest groups are hoping to disrupt several tribute concerts honoring the late pop star in the months to come.</p>
<p>And insiders say the renewed scandal has taken a considerable toll on Jackson&#8217;s three children.</p>

<p>Sources close to the family report that<a href="/2019/01/paris-jackson-breaking-down-over-new-michael-jackson-documentary/"> Paris Jackson suffered a breakdown</a> in the week&#8217;s before the film&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>Her brothers seem to have fared somewhat better, but it&#8217;s tough to say, as they tend to keep a lower profile.</p>
<p>A much, much lower profile, as it happens.</p>
<p>In fact, while Paris is covering magazines and interacting with millions on social media, her aptly-named youngest brother remains undercover as often as possible.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, Blanket Jackson sightings are rare, which is why fans were so excited to see the 17-year-old in a photo posted this week by his brother, Prince Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>The pic was taken at an <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> premiere party.</p>
<p>Blanket &#8212; or Bigi, as he&#8217;s more commonly known these days &#8212; can be seen in the center of the pic, rocking a Marvel t-shirt and his signature long hair.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Bigi is a fan favorite, and as Hollywood Life points out, many Instagram users <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/04/29/prince-jackson-brother-blanket-avengers-screening-pic-photo/">absolutely lost it</a> in the pic&#8217;s comments section.</p>
<p>“BABYYYYYYY my Bigi” one fan wrote.</p>
<p>“BABY BIGI OMG” another remarked.</p>
<p>“I know i’m weird but i CANT tell you how much i missed him,&#8221; a third exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;OMFGGGGGGGGG LIKE THIS MADE MY NIGHT LITERALLY. I NEED SOME HOLY WATER!!!&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A fourth fan pointed out the obvious, declaring:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone is noticing bigi only lol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, these are certainly tough times in the Jackson family.</p>
<p>But fans can take comfort in knowing that Blanket is reportedly happy and healthy &#8212; and he&#8217;s very obviously well-loved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Just a few weeks ago, <a href="/2019/03/aaron-carter-threatens-michael-jackson-accuser-in-shocking-video/">Aaron Carter threatened one of Michael Jackson&#8217;s accusers</a> in a shocking video.</p>
<p>However, after he&#8217;s had time to cool off and think about things, he appears to have changed his tune &#8212; dramatically.</p>
<p>Aaron has now revealed that he has his own untold &quot;experience&quot; with Michael Jackson.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/04/12/aaron-carter-michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-experience-truth/">TMZ</a>&nbsp;</em>caught up with Aaron Carter to ask him about the chilling Michael Jackson documentary, <em>Leaving Neverland</em>.</p>
<p>His interviewer wanted to know if he thought that the doc should be pulled from streaming and buried.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, to be honest, after seeing everyone&rsquo;s story unfold,&quot; Aaron begins.</p>
<p>He admits: &quot;I was a little aggressive when I talked about it at first.&quot;</p>
<p>That is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so long ago that Aaron told <em>TMZ </em>that he wanted to <em>punch </em>Wade Robson over his words in <em>Leaving Neverland</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Aaron continues, making it clear that his view has softend considerably since he shared his heated words.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone has their own stories.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; he observes. &quot;Everyone has their own situations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; he admits. &quot;I can&rsquo;t really take away from that.&quot;</p>
<p>We think that he&#8217;s saying that he has no right to silence someone who is speaking out.</p>
<p>Especially when he has come to realize that he cannot disprove their claims with his own experience.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t know,&quot; Aaron affirms. &quot;So I can&#8217;t be like &#8216;I was there.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s on a specific date, you can&#8217;t testify to witnessing someone <em>not </em>molesting a child.</p>
<p>But Aaron is going further than that.</p>
<p>&quot;In regards to that situation,&quot; he reveals. &quot;I actually have my own experience.&quot;</p>
<p>He is referring very vaguely to something &quot;that happened with Michael.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; Aaron promises. &quot;I&rsquo;mma be talking about that in the future.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The <em>TMZ </em>interviewer addresses the subject as delicately as possible, asking: &quot;like &#8230; abuse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;re just gonna have to find out when I talk about it,&quot; Aaron replies.</p>
<p>Aaron adds: &quot;I&#8217;m doing a book about my whole life,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Aaron continues. &quot;I think it&#8217;s appropriate to [write] about my experience with Michael.&quot;</p>
<p>But then he adds a line: &quot;I&#8217;ll always have his back.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Is Aaron planning to come forward with a claim that Michael Jackson sexually preyed upon him when he was a child?</p>
<p>Coupled with the line about having the late singer&#8217;s back, he could be suggesting that he forgives Michael for whatever alleged offense.</p>
<p>Or, as some fear, is he promising to share his own &quot;experience&quot; as a sort of buy-my-book <em>clickbait</em>.</p>
<p>He could be planning to address a situation that could have looked to others like something inappropriate, but was innocent.</p>
<p>But we won&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s coming to MJ&#8217;s defense or leveling an accusation of his own (or both, somehow) until the book comes out.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="507" height="410" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries.jpg" alt="Aaron Carter Cries" class="wp-image-271959" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries.jpg 507w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries-300x243.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries-335x271.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/aaron-carter-cries-347x281.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" /><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Poor Aaron Carter has had a number of major obstacles in his life.</p>
<p>His parents are widely believed to be among the worst sorts of &quot;stage parents&quot; one can imagine.</p>
<p>At a young age, Aaron was catapulted to mega fame, but doesn&#8217;t have the luxurious fortune to show for it.</p>
<p>As an adult, he has had an often strained relationship with his brother, Nick.</p>
<p>Combined with concerns over his mental and physical health and some of his more outlandish statements, a lot of people worry about him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he&#8217;s been taking steps to get better in recent years.</p>

<p>Biographer Mike Smallcombe announced on Twitter that he had obtained alleged evidence that contradicts a key part of an accuser&#8217;s story.</p>
<p>&#8220;James Safechuck&#8217;s story of being abused by Michael Jackson in Neverland&#8217;s train station has been derailed,&#8221; Smallcombe tweeted.</p>
<p>Given the grim context, the choice to make a train pun is &#8230; a bit nauseating and dismissive. Nevertheless:</p>
<p>Smallcombe goes on to explain that he has recently been granted access to building permits for Neverland Ranch.</p>
<p>A small detail on one of those pieces of paper, he says, unravels Safechuck&#8217;s story.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In <em>Leaving Neverland</em>, James Safechuck recalls having been molested by Michael Jackson as a child over the course of years.</p>
<p>Speaking of his time as a child, he mentions that this went on from 1988 to 1992.</p>
<p>One of the locations the he describes is a train station that Michael had built on his property.</p>
<p>But as Smallcombe explains, the permits show that the structure was built in 1993.</p>
<p>Does this mean that Smallchuck was fabricating his recollection of childhood sexual abuse?</p>
<p>The Jackson family&#8217;s attorney sure thinks so.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://theblast.com/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-train-station/"><em>The Blast</em></a>, Jackson family attorney Howard Weitzman argues that this exonerates Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safechuck’s train station fiction is one of several lies in this film,&#8221; Weitzman claims.</p>
<p>He accuses: &#8220;which shows that neither the director or HBO ever bothered to verify the claims made by these accusers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Safechuck’s allegations that he was abused in a building before it was even built and two years after he said the ‘abuse’ stopped speaks for itself,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The building was apparently not completed until 1994.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;Remember these are two individuals who filed lawsuits asking for millions of dollars,&#8221; Weitzman says.</p>
<p>He notes that this was &#8220;after changing years of their under oath testimony and multiple denials that Michael ever did anything inappropriate to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lawsuits were dismissed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But the accusers are appealing the dismissals.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then presents his theory as to why <em>Leaving Neverland</em> contained what he claims is a glaring inaccuracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe for the accusers, the director, and HBO this has always been about the money or ratings,&#8221; he concludes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Dan Reed, who directed <em>Leaving Neverland</em>, took to Twitter just days ago to defend Safechuck and the documentary.</p>
<p>&#8220;James Safechuck was at Neverland both before and after the construction of the train station there,&#8221; Reed says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two still photos of the station shown in <span class="PrettyLink-prefix">#</span><span class="PrettyLink-value">leavingneverland</span> were in fact taken by James,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Well, that definitely takes that defense down a peg.</p>
<p>He concludes, writing that Safechuck is someone &#8220;who is very clear that he was abused by Jackson in multiple places over many years.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So, what accounts for this discrepency?</p>
<p>We cannot honestly discuss it without acknowledging that trauma can have a severe and powerful effect upon memory.</p>
<p>People can recall, for example, a violent attack or incident of childhood abuse with horrific detail, but not remember when it happened, how they arrived, or how they left.</p>
<p>We should also note that Safechuck and Wade Robson both defended Jackson in court in 1993.</p>

<p>Robson says that Jackson showed him special interest during that time (after having all but ghosted him to shower attention on Macaulay Culkin).</p>
<p>Jackson settled that case out of court in 1994, the same year in which the train station was completed.</p>
<p>We cannot know for certain what happened or when it went down.</p>
<p>But the date of a building&#8217;s construction being at odds with a childhood memory doesn&#8217;t sound like the linchpin of any court case.</p>

<p>Specifically, of course,&nbsp;Paul McCartney is the latest musical icon to talk openly about the strong likelyhood that Michael Jackson was almost a serial child molestor.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Such accusations against Jackson are not new.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;ve been brought to the forefront of late and emphasized in the most personal and heinous of ways by the documentary <a href="/2019/03/paris-jackson-shocks-fans-with-drug-use-video-amid-leaving-never/">Leaving Neverland</a>.</p>
<p>It aired on HBO last month and centered on&nbsp;James Safechuck and Wade Robson, two men who claim the superstar abused them while they were young boys during the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>The film includes interviews with its subjects, along with&nbsp;harrowing details of their alleged ordeal and relationship with Jackson.</p>
<p>It appears to have convinced many previous doubters that Jackson truly was guilty of these awful crimes and misdeeds.</p>

<p>McCartney, the legendary former member of The Beatles, hasn&#8217;t defended Jackson in his first comments since the movie aired.</p>
<p>But he has expressed legitimate shock over what the documentary depicts and concludes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it&rsquo;s sad,&rdquo; McCartney told Radio Futuro in Chile, where he has been performing.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously Michael was a great singer, a great artist and a great dancer. For years we&rsquo;ve loved that. Nobody knew about the other side that&rsquo;s shown in that movie,&quot; the artist added.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really true, of course.</p>
<p>Jackson was taken to court (and acquitted) in 2005 on similar charges of molestation, whilc (reliable) talk about these kinds of actions following the singer around until his death in June of 2009.</p>

<p>&quot;When I knew him he was a really nice guy. I didn&rsquo;t know about the dark side,&quot; McCartney continues in this interview, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It makes it very difficult to look back on the memories which were good memories, to think, oh boy, there was other stuff going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Jackson covered McCartney&rsquo;s song &quot;Girlfriend&quot; on his &quot;Off the Wall&quot; album in 1979. The pair also recorded &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; together, along with &quot;Say Say Say.&quot;</p>
<p>They were pretty close many decades ago, which is why it&#8217;s so hard for McCartney to accept the probable truth about Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, I&rsquo;m okay to just stay with the personal memories I had of him. The other side is the other side. I don&rsquo;t know about that,&quot; McCartney said, concluding:</p>
<p>&quot;I can understand why people are very disappointed in him and angry that he had the dark side.&quot;</p>

<p>The other music Hall of Famers who have spoken out about Jackson have stuck their foot far deeper into their mouths than McCartney does here.</p>
<p>In a truly stunning and nauseating statement, <a href="/2019/03/barbara-streisand-defends-michael-jackson-he-was-just-horny/">Barbara Streisand recently said of The King of Pop</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has. You can say &lsquo;molested&#8217;, but those children, as you heard say [the grown-up Robson and Safechuck], they were thrilled to be there.&quot;</p>
<p>YIKES, right?</p>
<p>She even added:&nbsp;&quot;They both married and they both have children, so it didn&#8217;t kill them.&quot;</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230; so we guess the well-orchestrated molestation was okay then, Babs?</p>

<p>The singer/actress eventually apologized for these wildly tone deaf remarks, saying on Instagram:</p>
<p><em>I am profoundly sorry for any pain or misunderstanding I caused by not choosing my words more carefully about Michael Jackson and his victims, because the words as printed do not reflect my true feelings. I didn&#8217;t mean to dismiss the trauma these boys experienced in any way.</em></p>
<p><em>Like all survivors of sexual assault, they will have to carry this for the rest of their lives.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel deep remorse and I hope that James and Wade know that I truly respect and admire them for speaking their truth.</em></p>
<p>Diana Ross, however, is apparently standing by her words.</p>

<p>The Supremes singer referred to Jackson a &quot;magnificent incredible force&quot; and asked his accusers to &quot;<a href="/2019/03/diana-ross-i-still-support-michael-jackson-and-i-always-will/">stop in the name of love</a>&quot; in an impassioned, disgusting Tweet last week.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what&rsquo;s on my heart this morning. I believe and trust that Michael Jackson was and is A magnificent incredible force to me and to many other.&quot;</p>
<p>Ross concluded the messages by quoting one of The Supremes most famous hits, writing: &quot;STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE.&quot;</p>
<p>She was famously quite tight with Jackson, which is why we&#8217;d like to amend this conclusion and address Ross as follows:</p>
<p>STOP BEING TERRIBLE AND INSENSITIVE AND TOTALLY BLIND TO WHAT JACKSONW WAS IN THE NAME OF FRIENDSHIP.</p>
