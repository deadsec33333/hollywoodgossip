<p>Many credit Dakota Johnson with helping to deal the death blow to Ellen DeGeneres&#8217; career.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that Dakota can&#8217;t sabotage herself, too.</p>



<p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/armie-hammers-wife-breaks-her-silence-i-stand-with-his-victims/">Armie Hammer&#8217;s victims</a> have come forward to accuse him of vile things and sensational things.</p>



<p>For reasons that only she knows, Dakota decided to make a joke out of all of that human suffering.</p>

<p>Dakota Johnson gave a speech at the podium at Opening Night: A Taste of Sundance presented by IMDbPro.</p>



<p>During the Thursday event, she was ostensibly there to sing the praises of director Luca Guadagnino.</p>



<p>Luca directed <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>. Dakota cracked a joke about playing a non-human role in the film: the peach.</p>

<p>There is a memorable moment in the film when Timothee Chalamet&#8217;s character uses a peach to masturbate.</p>



<p>One would normally assume that this would be impossible (or at least uncomfortable), but both the actor and director tested it in real life. <em>Separately</em>, mind you.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sadly, I wasn&#8217;t in [Call Me By Your Name],&#8221; Dakota quipped. &#8220;Because I would&#8217;ve been another woman that Armie Hammer had tried to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Actually, no, that&#8217;s not the truth, Dakota. But we&#8217;ll get to that in a moment.</p>



<p>When Dakota voiced this &#8220;joke,&#8221; a few people let out an awkward chuckle. Then, a prolonged and awkward pause filled the audience.</p>



<p>Finally, people cheered &#8212; apparently, eager to break the tension and move on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dakota Johnson attends the EE British Academy Film Awards at The Royal Opera House on February 14, 2016 in London, England.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Guadagnino&#8217;s latest project is <em>Bones and All</em>, which happens to involve &#8230; well, cannibalism. After a fashion. </p>



<p>(At the risk of getting too technical, &#8220;eaters&#8221; in the film don&#8217;t seem to be normal humans, but it&#8217;s either cannibalism or something very similar)</p>



<p>Because of this, Dakota quipped: &#8220;Who knew cannibalism was so popular?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Armie Hammer appears here in glasses as he walks on busy streets before the pandemic, speaking to his camera.(Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s a bad joke for a couple of reasons.</p>



<p>First of all, Armie Hammer&#8217;s &#8220;edgy&#8221; sexual fantasies were just that. Talking about extreme BDSM or impossible scenarios (including cannibalism) happens between consenting partners. There&#8217;s no evidence that he&#8217;s a cannibal. Some of his messages were just <em>cringey </em>and sensational.</p>



<p>Secondly, and more importantly, there are <em>rape </em>accusations against Hammer. His cringe text messages are pretty meaningless compared to the allegations of abuse, manipulation, and sexual assault. And it renders the whole thing pretty un-funny.</p>

<p>We do have to be insufferable nerds for a moment and address Dakota&#8217;s line about the peach because &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t make sense?</p>



<p>In the film, Armie Hammer&#8217;s character does not eat the (what we will euphemistically call) &#8220;yum-filled&#8221; peach.</p>



<p>Yes, in the book, the character very knowingly eats the peach in a very charged scene. Not in the film. In fact, <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2017/11/armie-hammer-s-call-me-by-your-name-peach-scene.html"><em>Slate </em>bemoaned this change</a> in a 2017 article. So Dakota didn&#8217;t even have her facts straight. Corny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, there was this little book, this erotic little minx of a book, that went and took the world by storm.</p>
<p>You might remember it &#8212; after all, 50 Shades of Grey is one of the fastest-selling books of all time, with over 125 million copies sold.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a little bit of a phenomenon.</p>
<p>And when a book has sales that good, you have no choice but to make a movie, right?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So Jamie&nbsp;Dornan&nbsp;and Dakota Johnson <a href="/2013/09/50-shades-of-grey-cast-what-might-have-been/">were cast</a> to play Christian Grey, the millionaire with all the kinks, and Anastasia Steele, the virgin that won over his heart (or more accurately to the first book, his penis).</p>
<p>The movie did very well &#8211; come on, it&#8217;s <a href="/2014/11/50-shades-of-grey-trailer-do-you-trust-me/">a movie based on a book about sex and bondage and sexy bondage</a>, what else was going to happen?</p>
<p>And now, we have the second movie to look forward to it. And we are looking forward to it <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>50 Shades Darker is set to be released next February, and now we have a brand new trailer to get us psyched for it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a little more plot to this story, thanks to (spoiler alert!) this creepy girl that won&#8217;t leave Christian and Anastasia alone, plus Christian bares his soul or whatever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dakota Johnson won big at the <a href="/2016/01/peoples-choice-awards-2016-list-of-winners/">2016 People&#8217;s Choice Awards</a>, taking home the trophy for&nbsp;Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress.</p>
<p>She then almost gave viewers a look at her big breasts.</p>
<p>Nominated in this category for her role as Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey, the actress was sitting in the front row (wearing a sparkling silver dress) when she had her name called by presenters Leslie Mann and Alison Brie.</p>
<p>And Johnson made it on stage without any issue.</p>
<p>But then she hugged Mann and her fellow star&#8217;s hands accidentally caused some mischief to Johnson&#8217;s ensemble, causing her wardrobe to malfunction.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t enough to turn the awards ceremony into an NC-17 affair, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your view.</p>
<p>But it did give Johnson an opportunity to make the following crack, based on her racy role in the aforementioned hit movie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not like nobody here hasn&rsquo;t already seen my boobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HA! We love it.</p>
<p>Following a more serious speech, the star concluded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, okay, that&rsquo;s it, I don&rsquo;t know, bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson will next be seen opposite those very presenters, Mann and Brie, in <em>How To Be Single</em>, which opens in February.</p>
<p>She starts filming the <a href="/2015/04/fifty-shades-of-grey-sequels-release-dates-announced/">Fifty Shades of Grey sequel</a> (<em>Fifty Shades Darker</em>) around the same time, so it&#8217;ll be a busy year for her.</p>
<p>Check out the People&#8217;s Choice Awards wardrobe malfunction incident below and try not to be too sad over not actually seeing any nudity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Dakota Johnson has found a way to distract critics from the controversy surrounding <a href="/categories/fifty-shades-of-grey/">Fifty Shades of Grey</a>.</p>
<p>By getting herself involved in an even more serious controversy!</p>
<p>The actress hosted Saturday Night Live last night, welcoming her parents on stage during her monologue and mocking the sex-based movie for which she&#8217;s now best known.</p>
<p>But it was another skit altogether that generated tons of buzz on social media. For all the wrong reasons.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dakota-johnson-isis-commercial"></a></figure>
<p>In a pre-taped sketch that makes fun of an ongoing Toyota commercial, Johnson portrays a young woman who bids farewell to her sad father.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; instead of joining the army (as the daughter does in the aforementioned car ad), Johnson waves goodbye and joins terrorist group ISIS.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, of course, there has been a surge in the number of female jihadis from Western countries, including the United States, who have traveled to the Middle East to actually do this in real life.</p>
<p>ISIS has murdered an untold number of innocent people.</p>
<p>As a result, the show and the star got blasted on social media after this parody ad aired.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear #SNL, jokes about Isis are not funny. See how much you laugh when you have to see your loved one(s) being slaughtered. No respect,&quot; wrote one Twitter user, while another added:</p>
<p>&quot;I think it&#8217;s safe to say I will never watch SNL or any of Dakota Johnson&#8217;s movies ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>Taran Killam, however, who stars in the fake commercial as Johnson&#8217;s father, defended the skit, writing today online:</p>
<p>&quot;Proud of this. Freedom to mock is our greatest weapon. Thanks to the writers who asked not to be mentioned by name.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What do YOU think? Is anything fair game in comedy? Or did this sketch cross the line?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>We&#8217;ve all seen Dakota Johnson get down and dirty in Fifty Shades of Grey, and now it seems that millions of bored housewives weren&#8217;t the only ones who were titillated by the sight of the 25-year-old actress being degraded on screen.</p>
<p>Life &amp; Style claims Leonardo DiCaprio was spotted cozying up with Johnson an after-party for the recent <a href="/2015/02/saturday-night-live-40th-anniversary-special-all-the-fashion/">Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary</a> special.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>&#8220;He put his arm around Dakota and led her into the grand ballroom,&#8221; says one onlooker. &#8220;He told her, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go look at all the celebrities.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota looked like she was trying to play it cool, but you could tell she was thrilled to have his attention. Out of everyone he socialized with, you could tell he was happiest with Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;As they walked away, Leo took the lead and guided her through the crowd, and a small smile spread across her face.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sure that was a lot of fun for Dakota, but as you may have heard, <a href="/2015/01/rihanna-and-leonardo-dicaprio-have-been-hooking-up-for-years/">DiCaprio and Rihanna have been hooking up</a> in recent weeks, and RiRi doesn&#8217;t seem like the type who appreciates competition.</p>
<p>If it were a casual, friends-with-benefits sort of thing, we&#8217;re sure she wouldn&#8217;t mind, but <a href="/2015/02/rihanna-and-leonardo-dicaprio-spent-valentines-day-together-are/">Leo and Rihanna spent Valentine&#8217;s Day together </a>recently, which leads us to believe that there&#8217;s more going on than just sexy-time.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not saying that Rihanna is the violent type, but if it did come down to a fight over Leo, we&#8217;re pretty sure RiRi would make Christian Grey&#8217;s Red Room of Pain look like a tea party.</p>

<p>The Most Awkward Moment of the Night goes to&#8230; Dakota Johnson and her mother, Melanie Griffith, for an exchange the two were part of on the red carpet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>See,&nbsp;<a href="/2015/02/dakota-johnson-newly-single-after-fifty-shades-of-grey-release/">Dakota Johnson recently broke up Matthew Hitt</a>, and so she decided to Griffith accompany her to the Oscars instead.</p>
<p>Everything was going great. Mother and daughter looked splendid together. And then ABC&rsquo;s Lara Spencer asked the inevitable question to mother Melanie: &quot;It seems like everybody has seen [Fifty Shades of Grey]. Have you?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/melanie-griffith-and-dakota-johnson-get-awkward-about-fifty-shad"></a></figure></div>
<p>After Melanie repeatedly tells Spencer that she doesn&#8217;t need to see the movie to know how talented her daughter is, Dakota loses her cool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that all too familiar &quot;ALLLLRIGHT&quot; that we&#8217;ve all hit our parents with when they&#8217;ve said something a little too embarrassing in a forum that&#8217;s a little too public.</p>
<p>Melanie laughed off the moment like a pro and a mom who&#8217;s been there. But Dakota seemed a bit cranky, and that&#8217;s understandable, since her plate&#8217;s been pretty full recently:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Last night she presented Adam Levine&#8217;s performance of the song <em>Lost Stars.</em></li>
	<li>
		Last week she was in New York at the SNL 40 taping.</li>
	<li>
		This week she&#8217;s hosting SNL for the first time.</li>
	<li>
		Her movie <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> is out, a huge box office success but a critical flop.</li>
	<li>
		Rumors abound that <a href="/2015/02/jamie-dornan-and-dakota-johnson-hate-each-other-fifty-shades-pre/">Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan do not get along</a>.</li>
	<li>
		And now her mom is being all weird and stupid and whatever in front of, like, everybody at the Oscars.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can all relate to having those moments with our family members where they just keep saying the wrong thing, even as they&#8217;re trying to be cool.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t all relate to a spanking bench, though.</p>
