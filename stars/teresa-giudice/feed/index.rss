<p>Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas owe a massive, combined debt.</p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/is-luis-ruelas-the-next-jen-shah-class-action-suit-accuses-luis-company-of-illegal-phone-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations against Luis&#8217; companies</a> had some Bravo viewers branding him the next Jen Shah. That is not a compliment.</p>



<p>On a less spicy but considerably harder to dispute note, the two both have tax debts. As if they needed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/teresa-giudice-husband-affair-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more problems</a>.</p>



<p>Teresa and Luis apparently owe a combined $3 million. But one owes <em>way </em>more than the other.</p>

<p>In December of 2024, Luis received another lien for $163,523.94.</p>



<p>According to online services for the New Jersey Courts, that remains an open case.</p>



<p>Combined, this married couples&#8217; debts add up to about $3 million. Which is a lot.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-don-t-know-exactly-how-teresa-giudice-and-luis-ruelas-fell-behind-like-this">We don&#8217;t know exactly how Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas fell behind like this</h2>



<p>Obviously, debts of any kind can happen to anyone. That includes tax debts, which most commonly impact everyday workers &#8212; <em>especially </em>single moms who might be working multiple jobs to feed their families.</p>



<p>That said, it can often be difficult for your average American to understand seven-figure debts from ostensibly successful people. Teresa spent some time as a single mom, but she&#8217;s hardly an everyday worker.</p>



<p>It seems likely that Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas will be able to pay off their debts over time. At least, as long as she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bravo-fires-3-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-is-teresa-giudice-a-goner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains a <em>Real Housewife</em></a>. <em>RHONJ </em>fans just hope that Tre is not left holding the bag for Luis, as some fear.</p>

<p>In 2023, Teresa Giudice was hit with a $17,000 tax lien.</p>



<p>At the time, her attorney emphasized that the Bravolebrity was aware of what she owed and would continue to make payments on the outstanding sum.</p>



<p>Hopefully, she will continue to do so. She has enjoyed substantial financial success and comfort, and does have an obligation to contribute meaningfully to society in turn.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-this-is-not-what-she-got-in-trouble-for-years-ago">No, this is not what she got in trouble for years ago</h2>



<p>When Teresa Giudice went to prison in 2015, she served 11 months on charges of mail fraud, wire fraud, and bankruptcy fraud. This was the same case that saw her husband, Joe Giudice, deported to Italy.</p>



<p>Owing a debt is not the same as attempting to conceal assets or to defraud individuals or financial institutions or the government. Neither she nor Luis are facing accusations of anything of the sort in this case.</p>



<p>While Luis is not popular among Bravo fans (and has, by association, tanked Teresa&#8217;s popularity among some viewers), we hope that they&#8217;re both able to keep their heads above water. This debt is likely a stressful weight on their shoulders.</p>

<p>Executives at Bravo appear to have reached a decision when it comes to The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p>



<p>Fans of this franchise have been preparing for major changes for awhile now&#8230; ever since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-ends-in-total-chaos/">Season 14 ended in complete chaos</a>.</p>



<p>And not, like, fun, typical reality TV chaos, either.</p>



<p>The sort of behind-the-scenes chaos and confusion and left the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-canceled-ratings/">future of the show up in the air</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="927" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1024x927.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519521" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1024x927.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-300x272.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-768x696.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-2048x1855.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-960x869.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1080x978.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1200x1087.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice attends the DSW holiday gifting season event at Glasshouse Chelsea on November 14, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for DSW)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to OK! Magazine, there <em>will</em> be a Season 15 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p>



<p>The cast will look very different, however.</p>



<p>“The three women Bravo has kept engaged are Melissa Gorga, Teresa Giudice and Dolores Catania,” the <a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/rhonj-season-15-cast-revealed/">tabloid reported this week</a>. </p>



<p>“The other women &#8212; Margaret Josephs, Danielle Cabral and Rachel Fuda &#8212; were not given retention notices, and, at this time, Bravo is not pursuing them for a spot on RHONJ or any other side projects.” </p>



<p>This same article alleges Fuda was a “strong contender&#8221; to return, but her husband stood in the way because he was &#8220;difficult to deal with behind the scenes and [producers] didn’t feel it was worth the headache.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519522" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga attends the 2024 People&#8217;s Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on February 18, 2024 in Santa Monica, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gorga and Giudice, of course, are sisters-in-law &#8212; but they have feuded for years, to such an extent that Gorga has trashed her relative as toxic and has said she&#8217;ll <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/melissa-gorga-ill-never-film-with-toxic-teresa-giudice-again/">never film with Giudice again</a>.</p>



<p>But “Bravo loves the dynamic her husband [Joe Gorga] brings to the show,&#8221; this magazine explains, adding of the logic for keeping Melissa around:</p>



<p>“They find him funny and think viewers enjoy watching him do shots and interact with the other men. This isn’t something they wanted to let go of just yet.”</p>



<p>How will it work then? How will Gorga and Giudice co-exist on the same program?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519524" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga attends the Vivint Smart Lighting Launch Party on June 13, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images for Vivint)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>They won&#8217;t have to, apparently.</p>



<p>“As far as where the women will wind up at this point, it’s looking likely RHONJ will be led by Melissa and Dolores, and Teresa will be given a spin-off,” OK! writes. </p>



<p>“While fans still want to likely see both Melissa and Teresa on RHONJ, there just isn’t a world where that has any chance of happening due to where things stood last season and continue to stand today.”</p>



<p>Interesting, huh? Would you tune in for a Teresa Giudice spinoff?</p>



<p>No one from Bravo itself has confirmed this rumor just yet, but we&#8217;ll keep readers apprised on the status of Season 15 when more news breaks.</p>

<p>As you may have heard about, The Real Housewives of New Jersey may look a lot different next season.</p>



<p>And we might have at least idea of how right now.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-681x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508142" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-635530698-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice pose backstage at the Rookie USA fashion show during New York Fashion Week: The Shows at Gallery 3, Skylight Clarkson Sq on February 15, 2017 in New York City.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amid talk that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-reboot-cast/">most cast members have been fired</a> from the long-running franchise, Melissa Gorga has drawn a line in the sand.</p>



<p>Appearing this week on an installment of Two T&#8217;s In a Pod podcast, Gorga didn&#8217;t shy away from her feelings about the show in general at this point &#8212; and Teresa Giudice in particular.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because of all the rumors that are out there, I am fully prepared for anything,&#8221; Gorga told hosts Teddi Mellencamp and Tamra Judge of the aforementioned cast speculation, adding simply of her sister-in-law: </p>



<p>&#8220;I think I would realize that [Giudice] and I are two extremely different characters.&#8221;</p>



<p>That wasn&#8217;t all Melissa had to say about Teresa, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Bravo decides to go that route, kind of the darker whatever it is route, then I need to say, &#8216;That is not a show that I want to be on anyway,&#8217; which it truly isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Gorga continued, prior to speaking directly about Giudice:</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not want to be on that toxic sh-t, so as long as she is there and that whole thing would come back, I wouldn&#8217;t find it as a loss.&#8221;</p>



<p>Melissa and Teresa have been feuding for years.</p>



<p>They scarcely shared any scenes during The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14, which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-ends-in-total-chaos/">ended in such chaos</a> that producers scrapped the annual reunion.</p>

<p>Most viewers believe storylines have gotten and the characters simply boring.</p>



<p>Could the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/teresa-giudice-fired-rhonj/">network actually fire Giudice</a> and truly start all over from scratch?</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not leaving. I started the show and when Bravo wants me to leave, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll leave,&#8221; Giudice said on Live with Kelly &amp; Mark last month.</p>



<p>Sounds like the casting ball is therefore in the court of Andy Cohen and company.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re very curious to see what they do with it.</p>

<p>As it turns out, sometimes you <em>can</em> believe everything you read on the Internet.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, we reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-to-end-in-violence-scary-report/">The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14 would wrap</a> up in violent and ugly fashion.</p>



<p>And then the finale itself aired on Sunday night and&#8230; The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14 wrapped up in violent and ugly fashion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-1024x640.jpg" alt="The Real Housewives of New Jersey women" class="wp-image-506239" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-960x600.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-1080x675.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2-1200x750.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/RHONJ_14_SUPERTEASE_BRANDING-copy-2.jpg 1721w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Season 14.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Indeed, the anger-filled cast came together for what Dolores Catania deemed the &#8220;Last Supper&#8221; on this August 4 episode, with every woman sitting down for a meal at Rails restaurant.</p>



<p>&#8220;The theme of today is listening and letting everybody speak and being supportive,&#8221; Jennifer Fessler said early on.</p>



<p>However, this goal failed to be accomplished almost immediately after Danielle Cabral hurled a pitcher across the table at Jennifer Aydin, prompting producers to intervene and physically separate the women.</p>



<p>Amid chatter that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-canceled-ratings/">The Real Housewives of New Jersey is getting canceled</a>, further insults and words were exchanged from there, with each season-long feud simmering to a vicious boil&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-at-6.10.20%E2%80%AFAM-1024x621.png" alt="The cast of The Real Housewives of New Jersey" class="wp-image-504998"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cast of The Real Housewives of New Jersey poses for a promo pic.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Aydin and Cabral, of course, got into it earlier this season</strong> after Aydin accused her colleague of taking money from a charity event to repay herself for expenses. </p>



<p>On this finale, Aydin referenced this same allegation by claiming Cabral &#8220;can&#8217;t afford&#8221; to host such parties.</p>



<p>&#8220;You want my life. I get it,&#8221; Aydin said to Cabral at one point. &#8220;You get to my house, ‘This is what I want.’&#8221;</p>



<p>Cabral shot back, &#8220;I want nothing that you have. You have 18 f-cking bathrooms. Your house is empty.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cabral then attacked her costar&#8217;s marriage to Bill Aydin, trashing the union as follows: </p>



<p>&#8220;You are sad and I know you cry. I know you cry alone at home. I go home and my husband is waiting for me at the door.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your husband with the boobs?&#8221; replied Cabral, which led to the aforementioned pitcher toss.</p>

<p>In the wake of Cabral&#8217;s outburst, <strong>Teresa Giudice made fun of the two women,</strong> a response Melissa Gorga deemed hypocritical when you consider Giudice&#8217;s table-flipping past.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cut it out? You’re the queen of this sh-t!&#8221; Gorga told her estranged sister-in-law. &#8220;They learned from the best, white trash!&#8221;</p>



<p>Teresa then cursed off Melissa a bunch of times, adding very simply: &#8220;My brother married a whore!&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-attend-same-birthday-bash-did-they-annihilate-each-other/">These relatives have been at odds for years</a>.</p>

<p>This was all <strong>enough for Fessler to simply peace out</strong>.</p>



<p>&#8220;You guys, I’m going,&#8221; she announced to the group before leaving the establishment early. &#8220;I can’t mediate this. You guys have gotten used to this level of disgusting. I’m not used to it. I don’t want to be around this, it’s f&#8211;king gross.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a confessional, Fessler expressed regret. And annoyance. </p>



<p>&#8220;In my world, you smash glass or you break bread. They don’t really go together, right? Lunch is over,&#8221; she told the camera.</p>

<p>Giudice, meanwhile, was not content with only screaming at Gorga.</p>



<p>Remember when she accused Rachel Fuda&#8217;s husband, John Fuda, <strong>of being a drug dealer earlier this season</strong>?</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s not your f-cking place to talk about my f-cking husband,&#8221; Fuda yelled at her rival. &#8220;Stop talking about my f-cking husband!&#8221;</p>



<p>Giudice dropped more F-bombs in response and trashed Fuda as a &#8220;joke,&#8221; which led to Rachel going off even more.</p>



<p>&#8220;Keep my mother f-cking husband’s name out of your fat, f-cking hotdog-lipped mouth,&#8221; she fired back. &#8220;You’re a&#8211; needs to be checked!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Jackie Goldschneider admitted to having had Teresa&#8217;s husband&#8217;s ex-wife</strong> over to her house proper to that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/luis-ruelas-shirtless-bootcamp-video-revealed-why-is-teresa-giud/">cringe video leaking online</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I met with her,&#8221; Goldschneider told Giudice, referencing the ex-wife. &#8220;We hated each other, you went after my husband. But you know what? I’m glad that you know because I was always nervous that you were going to find out.&#8221;</p>



<p>And after Teresa started a cheating rumor about Goldschneider&#8217;s husband Evan, she actually understood her motives.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not surprised that Jackie talked to this person,&#8221; Giudice said in a confessional. &#8220;I get why she did it because she thinks I was trying to hurt her with the Evan rumor which, swear on my kids, I was not trying to hurt her.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, where <strong>could things go from here for The Real Housewives of New Jersey?</strong></p>



<p>Major changes appear to be ahead. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-reboot-confirmed-details/">The entire cast may be fired</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today’s meeting was a complete failure,&#8221; Gorga said in a finale confessional. &#8220;Pretty much everybody’s walking out the same way they walked in. Zero resolution.&#8221;</p>



<p>Catania, for her part, was in a state of mourning. </p>



<p>&#8220;Family is everything, but this group is no longer a family,&#8221; she sadded. </p>



<p>&#8220;How did it all come to this? It came out of really just people don’t know how to stop hating. It just built up and everybody just cuts so deep. It’s toxic. I look at this sit-down like a death.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea that Teresa Giudice could find herself fired from Real Housewives of New Jersey is not a new one. </p>



<p>For years, rumors have swirled suggesting she&#8217;s too vilatile to continue with the Bravo franchise. Most recently, declining ratings for season 14 and her explosive fight with Melissa Gorga the season before that have laid the ground work for conversations about her exit. </p>



<p>Well, Teresa would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teresa-giudice-leaving-rhonj-bravo-would-have-to-fire-me">Teresa Giudice Leaving RHONJ: Bravo Would Have To Fire Me!</h2>



<p>The <em>RHONJ</em> OG addressed that rumor that she&#8217;s ready to leave the long-running Bravo series during an interview on <em>Live With Kelly &amp; Mark</em> on July 9, 2024. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0">&#8220;Rumors are that you&#8217;re considering leaving the show, are they true?&#8221; Kelly Ripa asked Teresa point blank. Her response?</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">&#8220;Really? Who put those rumors out there? Maybe some of my cast members,&#8221; she replied.</p>



<p>She then made it perfectly clear that the only way she&#8217;s leaving the show is if she&#8217;s made to. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not leaving. I started the show. When Bravo wants me to leave, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>The topic of the season 14 reunion &#8211; or rather, the lack thereof &#8211; was also brought up. Teresa insisted there would be something for fans to watch. </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re having something. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re calling it, but we are doing something,&#8221; she promised. </p>



<p>Given the contentious dynamic of the cast &#8211; and the fact that last year&#8217;s reunion was such a disaster &#8211; we understand Bravo&#8217;s decision to do something different this year. </p>



<p>But it might also be working in Teresa&#8217;s favor as well, as rumors of her firing actually started after that infamous special.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teresa-nearly-fired-after-rhonj-s-reunion-in-2023">Teresa Nearly Fired After <em>RHONJ &#8216;s </em>Reunion in 2023?</h2>



<p>As we saw for ourselves, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/teresa-giudice-and-joe-gorga-cut-ties-at-rhonj-season-13-reunion/">Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga cut ties</a> at the <em>RHONJ </em>Reunion in 2023</p>



<p>The fight paid off for the network. Watching a feud splinter a family drew in <em>millions </em>of viewers.</p>



<p>But then reports said that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-feud-puts-rhonj-season-14-on-hiatus/">Season 14 was on hold</a> &#8230; because Teresa and Melissa were too bitter to film together. Then came word that one or both of them would need to be axed for the show to live.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> does not air in real time. The Housewives film months in advance. It&#8217;s often well over half a year between an episode filming and airing.</p>



<p>Initially, the plan was for <em>RHONJ </em>Season 14 to begin filming pretty much as soon as the Season 13 reunion aired. Which, in turn, was months after it filmed.</p>



<p>But instead, Bravo had to reportedly put those plans on hold. The entire cast sat in limbo &#8230; seemingly because of the feud between the in-laws. </p>



<p>And indeed, Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga were so bitterly at odds that it made filming impractical. It looked like one had to go. </p>



<p>But as we know now, having lived through season 14, that didn&#8217;t happen.  And now?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-would-teresa-leave-for-louis-sake">Would Teresa Leave For Louis&#8217; Sake?</h2>



<p>Despite what she told Kelly Ripa, the more recent rumors of Teresa leaving the show has less to do with her being fired and more about her wanting to leave for the sake of her marriage. </p>



<p>A source who spoke to <em><a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/teresa-giudice-might-not-want-come-back-rhonj-drama/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OK! Magazine</a></em> spilled that Teresa was considering leaving the show to focus on her marriage,  particularly after costar Margaret Josephs fired off accusations about Luis Ruelas left and right. </p>



<p>In truth, Teresa herself has admitted that being on the show has put a strain on her new beloved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;He didn’t sign up for this,&#8221; Teresa said on the show. &#8220;[Louie] met [me] not thinking that a lot of my cast members were gonna attack him on my show, which they did because they were trying to get to me. And they knew they didn’t have anything on me, so instead they figured, ‘Let’s hurt the person she loves,’ and that’s what they’ve been doing.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> needs to be canceled. There, we said it. </p>



<p>If you think it&#8217;s too soon to bid the franchise farewell, then you&#8217;re in the minority. </p>



<p>The latest season of these Teresa Giudice-focused series kicked off on May 6 to very little fanfare&#8230; with <a href="https://collider.com/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratings</a> for Episode 3 plummeting to a franchise low.</p>



<p>Now, the season won&#8217;t even get the fan-favorite reunion episodes because there is so much animosity between the stars. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-canceled-for-good-it-looks-like-it-could-be">Real Housewives Of New Jersey Canceled For Good? It Looks Like It Could Be </h2>



<p>The May 20 installment only garnered 699,000 thousands viewers overall, a scant 160,000 of whom comprised the advertiser-friendly demographic of 18-49-year olds.</p>



<p>Might America finally be sick of these Garden State residents?</p>



<p>In particular, might they have tired of a program that has become about Giudice and, really, Giudice <em>only</em> for multiple years now?</p>



<p>Teresa isn&#8217;t very likable, and she isn&#8217;t very interesting at this point, either.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-trailer-teases-turmoil-for-teresa-giudice-luis-ruelas-is-the-marriage-over/">trailer for Season 14</a> made it clear that the focus, once again, would be on Teresa this spring and summer.</p>



<p>The main storyline to date has centered on Teresa&#8217;s marriage to Louis Ruelas, a controversial figure who may have &#8220;pissed her money away,&#8221; according to one cast member via the aforementioned preview.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also tension between Margaret Josephs and pals Jenn Fessler and Jackie Goldschneider, the latter two of whom have formed a newfound bond with, you guessed it&#8230; Teresa.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who you want to associate yourself with?&#8221; Josephs asks Fessler, later referring to Jackie as &#8220;Judas&#8221; while discussing their rift in a conversation with Joe. </p>



<p>&#8220;You want to tell Teresa everything you&#8217;ve been doing behind her back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m being friends with whomever I want to be friends with, and I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; Jackie responds</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-an-explosive-fight-save-the-show">Will An Explosive Fight Save The Show?</h2>



<p>The trailer also shows an all out BRAWL in a NJ restaurant. It&#8217;s likely this won&#8217;t happen until the finale, but the highlights may be what keeps fans holding on.  </p>



<p>Rachel Fuda has words with Giudice this season, screaming at her in one scene:</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a f&#8211;cking bully, Teresa,&#8221; she says.</p>



<p>Giudice then fires back: &#8220;Don&#8217;t poke the f-cking bear.&#8221;</p>



<p>The response by many viewers here may very well be, &#8220;We&#8217;re sick of watching this f-cking bear over and over and over after all this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Did Bravo make a mistake in bring back ALL of Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, Josephs, Jennifer Aydin, Danielle Cabral, Fuda, Goldschneider <em>and</em> Fessler for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-everything-you-need-to-know/">The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14</a>?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s starting to seem that way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-reunion-special-was-cancelled">Why The Real Housewives Of New Jersey Reunion Special Was Cancelled </h2>



<p>The writing is already on the wall, given the news that the latest season of RHONJ won&#8217;t even have a reunion episode. </p>



<p>Season 14 will end unresolved, as for the first time in the history of the series, there will not be a traditional reunion.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0">During an appearance on <em>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</em> that aired on Sunday, June 9, Teresa addressed the news of Bravo forgoing the reunion directly to Andy&#8217;s face. It&#8217;s clear that the other women will not be seen with her, but perhaps that&#8217;s for good reason. </p>



<p>Teresa revealed that she had already come up with a strategy of how she was going to handle her ongoing feud with Rachel Fuda and her husband, John Fuda, and that she was going to let it all play out on the reunion special. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0">&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad we aren&#8217;t having a reunion because I was going to bring an envelope and I was going to take something out of the envelope,&#8221; Teresa said, referencing a moment from the season 13 reunion when John showed an envelope with alleged proof that Giudice&#8217;s husband, Luis Ruelas, had been investigating his family — though he never opened the envelope.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">&#8220;I was going to bring it tonight, but I want to make sure we have a reunion,&#8221; Teresa added , but Andy was quick to dodge the question. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll have you back before the end of the season,&#8221; he said. </p>

<p>So much for tradition.</p>



<p>With The Real Housewives of New Jersey sagging in the ratings, and with many out there wondering whether or not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-canceled-ratings/">The Real Housewives of New Jersey will even be canceled</a> after this upcoming season, we now have a significant update on the franchise.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s a significant change, as well.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-1024x683.webp" alt="The Real Housewives of New Jersey women" class="wp-image-501054" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/rachel-fuda-margaret-josephs-melissa-81023410.webp 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Say hello to the ladies of The Real Housewives of New Jersey.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Andrew Eccles/Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to a Bravo insider, there will NOT be a Season 14 reunion to wrap up this year&#8217;s feuds, arcs and storylines.</p>



<p>Such a decision marks the first time this series will ever conclude without such a special.</p>



<p>A source has told Page Six this is due to the &#8220;divisive state of the show,&#8221; while People Magazine quotes someone who had said the following of the surprising move:</p>



<p>&#8220;A reunion is meant to have resolution and it&#8217;s clear in the season final that there is no path forward in that type of setting. So the network is figuring out a different concept to wrap up the season.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-02-at-9.37.52%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="Danielle on The Real Housewives of New Jersey" class="wp-image-501055"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Danielle on The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>How mysterious, huh?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-everything-you-need-to-know/">Season 14 features</a> veteran cast member Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga, plus Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs, Jennifer Aydin, Jackie Goldschneider, Danielle Cabral, Rachel Fuda and Jennifer Fessler.</p>



<p>Through four episodes, things really do seem rockier than ever among, well&#8230; everyone. </p>



<p>This is nothing new, of course, considering The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-ends-in-total-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="73">Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> has had split panels at BravoCon over the past two years.</p>



<p>At this point, sisters-in-law Teresa and Melissa do not even interact with each other, although a recent finale trailer made it look like this will eventually change.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Margaret is not getting along at all Teresa, either, after alleging at the season 13 reunion that the mother of four&#8217;s husband, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/luis-ruelas/">Luis Ruelas</a>, called and threatened her son at his place of business.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain how these feuds will play out on the episodes to come, but look for an intense all-cast dinner to be feature on the final Season 14 installment.</p>



<p>“It makes sense,” the Page Six insider teases. </p>



<p>“And once viewers see the finale, the decision to forgo the traditional reunion will make even more sense.”</p>

<p>To be clear, no one associated with Bravo has commented on this strong reunion rumor just yet.</p>



<p>The only previous time when a reunion was canceled in the Real Housewives franchise was in season 13 of The Real Housewives of New York City.</p>



<p>After that?</p>



<p>Producers fired the entire cast and brought in new women for Season 13.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everything and anything is on the table,&#8221; an <a href="https://people.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-reunion-canceled-exclusive-8655924">insider tells People</a> about any similar move for this franchise, noting that &#8220;all options are being discussed and &#8220;nothing official about the show has been decided.&#8221;</p>

<p>The daughter of Teresa Giudice has been in a car crash. Oh no!</p>



<p>After spending most of her life growing up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-canceled-just-look-at-these-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em></a>, Milania Giudice is a young adult.</p>



<p>On Bravo and on social media, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/teresa-giudice-blamed-for-daughter-milanias-rapid-weight-loss-stop-the-cruel-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milania has her own life</a>, her own story, and <em>sometimes </em>her own drama.</p>



<p>Most recently, Milania was in a car crash in her fancy new car. But there are a few silver linings to the story.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-milania-giudice-third-daughter-of-teresa-giudice-was-in-a-car-crash">Milania Giudice, third daughter of Teresa Giudice, was in a car crash</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/05/21/milania-giudice-car-crash-not-at-fault-teresa-giudice-daughter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a police report</a> that <em>TMZ </em>obtained, Teresa&#8217;s daughter Milania Giudice was driving her new Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p>



<p>The vehicular collision reportedly occurred in Boonton, New Jersey on Friday, May 17. </p>



<p>Milania&#8217;s pricey, luxurious vehicle ended up making unwanted contact with another car at an intersection. But which driver is to blame?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="I Got Pulled Over Rushing To My Mom | Milania Giudice" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VWQAE1OS_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the police report, the drivers did not see eye to eye when it came to the fault for the collision. And no, it doesn&#8217;t sound like Milania was driving like a bat out of hell, either.</p>



<p>The 18-year-old <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reality TV personality</a> told police that the other driver had driven despite the stop sign, striking her car in the intersection. (It is unclear if she was T-boned)</p>



<p>We do not know the identity of the other driver. However, they asserted that they had come to a complete stop at the stop sign, looked both ways, and then driven through the intersection &#8212; only to nonetheless get into a car crash with Milania&#8217;s vehicle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-good-news-teresa-milania-was-not-at-fault-for-the-car-crash-according-to-police">Good news, Teresa! Milania was not at fault for the car crash (according to police)</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the traffic cops at the scene ended up siding with Milania &#8212; and against the other driver.</p>



<p>According to the report, the vehicular collision only took place because the other party displayed &#8220;inattention and failing to yield to the right of way.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, Milania had right of way, and the stop sign should have prevented the collision. It did not.</p>

She feels betrayed.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And there is more good news. <em>TMZ</em>&#8216;s report also included a statement from the Giudice family&#8217;s attorney, James Leonard.</p>



<p>Not only did Leonard confirm that Milania did not sustain any injuries during the accident, he also noted: &#8220;We are extremely grateful that nobody was hurt. That&#8217;s all that matters.&#8221; </p>



<p>Good! Preventable injuries (like a car crash) are the third leading cause of death in the United States. It&#8217;s good to hear that both Milania and the other driver were okay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-there-s-some-bad-news-for-milania-following-the-car-crash">But there&#8217;s some bad news for Milania following the car crash</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Milania&#8217;s Mercedes-Benz &#8212; which was still so new that it has temporary tags &#8212; left the car crash scene via tow truck.</p>



<p>Just because she&#8217;s from a wealthy family doesn&#8217;t mean that it doesn&#8217;t suck when her expensive belongings take damage. She just has more of a safety net.</p>



<p>Shifting back to the positives, Milania recently celebrated her college acceptance. She applied to and received an acceptance letter to the University of Tampa. That&#8217;s fantastic news for this high school senior.</p>

<p><strong>The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14 Might Be the Most Dramatic One Yet.</strong></p>



<p>This is what Bravo wrote as a caption to a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-trailer-teases-turmoil-for-teresa-giudice-luis-ruelas-is-the-marriage-over/">preview for new episodes</a> of this long-running franchise, which returns on Sunday night, May 5.</p>



<p>It sounds familiar, we know.</p>

<p>On Season 14, Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs, Jennifer Aydin, Danielle Cabral and Rachel Fuda will be featured as lead cast members… while Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler will return as Friends.</p>



<p>According to The Sun, filming kicked off way back in August 2023, not long after a three-part reunion aired in Bravo in June.</p>



<p>This same outlet reports that Giudice will remain the focus of the series on Season 14, but that she also will stick to her vow to stay clear from sister-in-law Melissa Gorga.</p>



<p>We actually won&#8217;t see very much of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-attend-same-birthday-bash-did-they-annihilate-each-other/">these women feuding</a>.</p>

<p>So, what <em>will</em> we witness this spring and summer?!?</p>



<p>&#8220;<strong>Margaret and Jackie got into a big argument</strong> over her book. Jackie gave out copies of her book to a few cast members, but Margaret did not get one and that made her question their friendship,&#8221; an <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/11262205/rhonj-season-14-secrets-blowout-fights-filming-restrictions-cast/">insider tells The Sun</a>.</p>



<p>Josephs especially takes issue with her so-called friend because she introduced Jackie to the publicist who helped get her this book deal.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think people are so used to Jersey being about family,&#8221; Gorga has said to The Sun. &#8220;It&#8217;s a huge twist this year &#8211; plot twist!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret also teased to this publication that the &#8220;biggest fight&#8221; this season is between Jennifer Aydin and Danielle Cabral. A PHYSICAL fight, she emphasizes.</p>



<p>&#8220;<strong>Jennifer pushed Danielle during the argument </strong>and Danielle retaliated by crumpling her plastic cup and hurling it towards Jennifer’s face, drawing blood,&#8221; a source previously alleged to Page Six.</p>



<p>These cast members were even suspended for a few days as a result of this altercation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could say for me it was very surprising. But for the viewer and fan of Housewives, it&#8217;s not surprising. They already knew what kind of person I was dealing with,&#8221; Danielle says to The Sun.</p>

<p>As for Teresa&#8217;s controversial husband, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/luis-ruelas/">Luis Ruelas</a>?</p>



<p><strong>Rachel and John Fuda will continue to accuse him</strong> of hiring an investigator to look into their lives.</p>



<p>These accusations have been brought to court &#8212; as of February 2024 &#8212; when attorney Kevin S. Johnson and his firm filed a lawsuit against Luis (among others), accusing him of violating the Federal Wiretap Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act.</p>

<p>Finally&#8230; <strong>welcome to Kayla Giovinazzo, Tiffany Chantell-Rosania, and Jessica Kiraly</strong>.</p>



<p>These three fresh faces were brought on this season &#8220;as a test,&#8221; writes The Sun, to see if they might replace any veteran cast members down the line.</p>



<p>Tiffany competed on The Amazing Race in 2015; Kayla is married to Jamie Giovinazzo, the CEO and Founder of Eat Clean Bro; and Jessica creates fashion and lifestyle content on social media.</p>

<p>Bravo has released the first trailer for The Real Housewives of New Jersey, and you may not believe this&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; but it looks like a lot of drama is on the way.</p>



<p>First, the series will bring back Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs, Jennifer Aydin, Danielle Cabral and Rachel Fuda as lead cast members&#8230; with Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler returning as Friends.</p>

<p>As is so often the case for this franchise, Giudice appears to be the main focus of upcoming episodes&#8230; although her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-attend-same-birthday-bash-did-they-annihilate-each-other/">feud with Melissa Gorga</a> isn&#8217;t referenced at all.</p>



<p>Instead, it&#8217;s Teresa marriage to Luis Ruelas that has everyone talking &#8212; and speculating.</p>



<p>&#8220;Teresa is distraught because in the house, there&#8217;s not a lot of calm,&#8221; Danielle says in the preview, before Jennifer Aydin chimes in as follows: </p>



<p>&#8220;Every time I talk to her, her stomach is in knots.&#8221;</p>

<p>These remarks are cut with footage of Teresa walking with Ruelas, while Dolores says of her colleague:</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not doing great.&#8221;</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t us long to learn why not, either, as an unknown voice claims &#8220;Louis pissed away her money.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/melissa-gorga-slams-luis-ruelas-as-manipulator-calls-teresa-fake-af/">been concern about Ruelas</a> almost as soon as Giudice started dating him, with various critics trashing Luis as a fraud or a schemer.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t learn any more details about what he may or may not have done with his wife&#8217;s money in this trailer, however.</p>

<p>At another point, the emotional and suspenseful promo goes over to argument between Louie and Teresa. </p>



<p>&#8220;I want it to be better,&#8221; he says, as she notes, &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be better. I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Once again, mystery clouds the scene. Producers sure know how to build intrigue, don&#8217;t they?</p>



<p>And even when Teresa&#8217;s relationship with Ruelas is not front and center, her relationship with <em>others</em> still dominates coverage.</p>

<p>For example, video teases shifting friendships between Margaret and pals Jenn Fessler and Jackie, both of whom have formed a surprising bond with Giudice.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who you want to associate yourself with?&#8221; she asks Jenn, later referring to Jackie as &#8220;Judas&#8221; while talking about their rift in a conversation with Joe. </p>



<p>&#8220;You want to tell Teresa everything you&#8217;ve been doing behind her back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m being friends with whomever I want to be friends with, and I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; Jackie fires back.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Jenn Fessler is also on the outs with Rachel, who, naturally, is ALSO feuding with Teresa. </p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a f&#8212;ing bully, Teresa,&#8221; she screams, as Teresa warns her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t poke the f&#8212;ing bear.&#8221;</p>



<p>YIKES, huh?</p>

<p><strong>Although her loyalties stand with best friend Teresa, Jennifer A. is finally in a good place with the friend group, especially Melissa and Margaret. However, a turn of events has her questioning certain relationships.</strong></p>
