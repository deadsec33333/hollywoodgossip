<p>Hannah Brown has at last handed out her final rose.</p>



<p>In a figurative manner of speaking.</p>



<p>The former Bachelorette lead confirmed to People Magazine on Monday that she got engaged to Adam Woolard on August 24 at Bolt Farm Treehouse in Whitwell, Tennessee.</p>



<p>Brown detailed just how her boyfriend surprised her with the proposal in an exclusive interview with the aforementioned publication.</p>

<p>“We had talked about getting engaged, but I felt so content and safe in our relationship, I wasn’t rushing it,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/the-bachelorettes-hannah-brown-engaged-to-adam-woolard-exclusive-7853428">Brown told People</a>, explaining that she thought she and Adam were visiting this property to help out its owners&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; having no idea that her family was staying there to help Woolard with his surprise.</p>



<p>“(I loved) not only the intimacy of the surprise by ourselves, but also how we were able to celebrate with friends and family,&#8221; continued Brown.</p>



<p>&#8220;And the surprise. I love surprises.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brown and Woolard <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/hannah-browns-new-boyfriend-looks-just-like-tyler-cameron/">were romantically linked in January 2021</a> when they were spotted on different outings in Nashville and Los Angeles. </p>



<p>They were then photographed clasping hands.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a> Season 15 star made their relationship Instagram official that Valentine’s Day.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy Valentine’s Day @admandew,” Brown wrote across a photo of the couple kissing while riding horses.</p>

<p>Prior to finding her soulmate, Brown was a contestant on Colton Underwood’s season 23 of The Bachelor. </p>



<p>She was then casted as The Bachelorette &#8230; where she met her now-ex-fiancé, Jed Wyatt.</p>



<p>Amid conflicting stories about Wyatt’s relationship with an ex-girlfriend, and questions about his sincerity and his fidelity, Brown dumped Wyatt in a phone call ahead of ABC&#8217;s After the Final Rose special. </p>



<p>She reconnected with her runner-up, Tyler Cameron at one point, but the romance didn&#8217;t last.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hannah Brown has come out with a revealing memoir.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just a few months after meeting Woolard, Brown told People that she had a strong feeling he might be The One.</p>



<p>“It’s been the accumulation of moments that have made me feel loved and seen and accepted in a way I never have,” she said awhile back, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;I love his calming presence and big heart. And how he accepts and loves all versions of me…even the crazy version.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re so very happy for these future spouses! Congratulations to Hannah Brown and Adam Woolard!</p>

<p>But it hasn&#8217;t always been easy.</p>
<p>During an appearance on The Tamron Hall Show this past Friday, the Alabama native opened up &#8212; way, <em>way</em> up &#8212; about how she felt in the wake of her run as this franchise lead..</p>
<p>Or, to be more specific, how she behaved.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1008" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-1008x1024.png" alt="Hannah Brown on After the Final Rose" class="wp-image-416678" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-1008x1024.png 1008w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-295x300.png 295w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-768x780.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-735x746.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-330x335.png 330w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-342x347.png 342w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-512x520.png 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-630x640.png 630w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-756x768.png 756w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-945x960.png 945w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose-1063x1080.png 1063w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/hannah-brown-on-after-the-final-rose.png 1094w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never really been a drinker before and I was on TV, like, every Monday for an entire year and didn&rsquo;t know how to handle how my life had so publicly been displayed,&rdquo; Brown explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[I] have always lived with a smile on my face and, you know, tried to pretend like everything was okay.</p>
<p>&quot;But then when I was at home by myself, the only thing that was really giving me comfort was a glass of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 27-year old was a rather polarizing presence on the small screen, mostly because she talked candidly about both her religion and also her passion for sex.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In one memorable recollection, Brown admitted to sleeping <a href="/2019/12/peter-weber-im-more-than-just-an-often-erect-sex-machine/">with contestant Peter Weber four times in one night</a>.</p>
<p>Hannah stood up strongly for herself throughout her season, but talked to Hall about her state of mind during The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[I have] no excuses for mistakes that I&rsquo;ve made but also, I was not in the best place of life,&rdquo; Brown said on the broadcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And [I] didn&rsquo;t know what resources I had to be able to get that help.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In her memoir, <em>God Bless This Mess</em>, Brown wrote that she would sometimes start drinking at 11 a.m. and &quot;never really stopped&quot; as the day went on.</p>
<p>&quot;It was another way of avoiding the big problems, I guess,&quot; said the former beauty queen in this book.</p>
<p>Brown also confessed to Entertainment Tonight in November that she started drinking in the wake of her split from season 15 winner Jed Wyatt&#8230; after it came out that he had a girlfriend while filming the ABC program.</p>
<p>When things didn&rsquo;t work out with her runners-up, Tyler Cameron and Peter Weber, her alcoholism only got worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was really interesting to see how it goes from one glass of wine, two glasses of wine, three glasses of wine, tequila,&rdquo; Brown said back then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve definitely reassessed how alcohol is a part of my life&hellip; You just are not going to find what your heart needs in that.</p>
<p>&quot;I think just a lot of people, we do that. We kind of fill a void.</p>
<p>&quot;I was definitely finding myself in that cycle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To her credit, Brown has candidly discussed her struggles with depression and anxiety on social media.</p>
<p>In 2021, after watching Oprah and Prince Harry&rsquo;s mental health docuseries The Me You Can&#8217;t See, Brown shared the following on her her Instagram Story:</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not easy living with depression and anxiety or any mental illness, but conversations like these are so impactful to help us all feel not so alone on our mental health journey.&quot;</p>

<p>The Dancing With the Stars season 28 champion continued to ET late last year:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad that I&rsquo;ve gotten the help that I needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The therapy, the emotional support that I needed to kind of deal with my own stuff going on inside my heart, and mind, and just my mental health, so that [alcohol] is not something that I go to for any type of solace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown also credits boyfriend&nbsp;<a href="/2021/01/hannah-browns-new-boyfriend-looks-just-like-tyler-cameron/">Adam Woolard</a> for the progress she&#8217;s made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are people that do not find wholeness through each other but through becoming whole people as individuals that can then amplify each other&rsquo;s growth,&rdquo; she told Hall on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is something that I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve ever had is somebody that is equally encouraged and motivated by continuing to challenge and get better and move forward and grow in life as I am&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;[I] can really see the progress I&rsquo;ve made just in how I view my relationship and how I view my relationship with myself.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re so very glad to hear it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>During her run as The Bachelorette, it certainly seemed as if Hannah Brown was an open book.</p>
<p>But go ahead and actually <em>open</em> the new book that Brown has written?</p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll learn a whole lot about the Alabama native.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In this memoir (&quot;God Bless This Mess&quot;), for example, the 27-year old delves into how she suffered persistent stomachaches in fifth grade.</p>
<p>To determine the issue, Brown went in for an MRI &#8230; which led to the discovery of &ldquo;a tumor the size of an egg&rdquo; on her pancreas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sent me for a biopsy, and a day or so later, my dad got a call with the results &#8212; not from our regular doctor, but from an oncologist. The tumor was malignant.</p>
<p>&quot;Cancer. Pancreatic cancer &#8212; one of the deadliest forms of cancer there is,&rdquo; Brown writes, dropping quite the bombshell.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Hannah learned, thankfully, that the cancer had not spread anywhere else on her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the day of my surgery, I wasn&rsquo;t scared about what was going to happen to me. At all,&rdquo; she recalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though my mother was in tears and my dad looked as worried as I&rsquo;d ever seen him in my life as the nurses came to wheel me into the operating room, I looked up at my mom from my hospital bed and said:</p>
<p>&quot;&lsquo;Mama, I&rsquo;m going to be okay.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The operation ultimately did not leave behind any cancerous cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to go to checkups a few times a year or so after that,&rdquo; the Dancing With the Stars Season 28 winner notes.</p>
<p>&quot;But nothing else ever turned up in my scans or in my bloodwork.&quot;</p>
<p>Wow. Amazing. We&#8217;ve never heard of an 11-year old with pancreatic cancer before.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Elsewhere in this same book, Brown tells yet another shocking story.</p>
<p>She was six years old. She was getting ready to perform at a recital. And her dad pulled her away to tell her that her aunt and very young cousins had been murdered.</p>
<p>&quot;When my mom told us that somebody had come into their house and &lsquo;hurt them,&#8217; it terrified me in the deepest parts of my heart,&quot; Hannah writes.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#8217;t know the whole story with all the details until years later, but coming that close to something so awful, so terrifying &#8212; it was a turning point for me.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The author added:</p>
<p>&quot;It changed everything. I was no longer living in the innocence of an untouched childhood.&quot;</p>
<p>E! News has actually shared a full excerpt <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1310650/bachelor-nations-hannah-brown-details-the-murder-of-her-aunt-and-young-cousins">from Brown&#8217;s book</a> &#8212; in which she explains how her mother told her that Aunt LeeLee, and Robin and Trent were &quot;now your angels in heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>How has she persevered through such a tragedy?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>She writes:</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to make it through all of this at such a young age was to believe in something so much bigger than me.</p>
<p>&quot;Without my faith in God, and in heaven, I&#8217;m not sure I would ever have slept through the night again. I still have trouble sleeping now&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#8217;t begin to heal until I was in my mid-twenties, in the presence of a therapist. And until I opened up about it in this book, almost no one knew about it.</p>
<p>&quot;So now, I&#8217;m just hoping that you, and anybody else who hears about it, will take this story and treat me gently with it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Brown, of course, chose Jed Wyatt as her Bachelorette winner, only to eventually split from him.</p>
<p>On a far lighter note, she also writes in the memoir about intercourse with him versus intercourse with another suitor, Peter Weber.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ll be honest here,&quot; confesses Brown in the book, which is now on sale.</p>
<p>&quot;The sex wasn&rsquo;t as good as it was with Peter.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s a tale of two Hannahs and one very busy Peter!</p>
<p>Earlier this week, fans were shocked by the news that <a href="/2021/11/hannah-brown-i-slept-with-peter-weber-during-his-bachelor-season/">Hannah Brown hooked up with Peter Weber </a><em>during</em> his time as the Bachelor.</p>
<p>The news comes to us courtesy of comments Brown made to <em>People</em> magazine, as well as excerpts from her upcoming memoir,&nbsp;<em>God Bless This Mess</em>.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, the news didn&#8217;t sit well with the ladies who vied for Peter&#8217;s heart during his time on the show, least of all the woman who received his final rose, Hannah Ann Sluss.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>If you watched that trainwreck (or perhaps we should call it a plane-wreck, given pilot Pete&#8217;s profession), then you&#8217;ll probably recall that Pete was just about the most indecisive, wishy-washy Bachelor in franchise history.</p>
<p>We already knew that he pursued relationships with no fewer than three of his potential paramours after the cameras stopped rolling.</p>
<p>And now, it seems that Weber attempted to make things work with Hannah B., as well.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>All of the women on Peter&#8217;s season were dismayed when Hannah arrived on set during taping, but no one has more reason to be upset about Ms. Brown&#8217;s latest bombshell than Pete&#8217;s former fiancee.</p>
<p>Even though the relationship fizzled shortly thereafter, the fact remains that <a href="/2020/03/hannah-ann-sluss-on-peter-weber-i-hated-being-engaged-to-that-ma/">Peter and Hannah were engaged</a> at one point, and his lingering feelings toward the other Hannah might have played a role in his decision to call it quits.</p>
<p><em>Bachelor</em> fans have been waiting for Sluss to sound off on the situation ever since the other Hannah went public with her recollections.</p>

<p>And now, the folks who were eager to hear the Sluss side of the story have gotten their wish &#8212; sort of.</p>
<p>Hannah Ann posted the TikTok below on Thursday, and while she doesn&#8217;t mention Weber or Brown by name, it&#8217;s quite clear who she&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>&quot;When the tea officially spills&hellip;&quot; Sluss captioned the clip.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/hannah-ann-sluss-shades-peter-weber-hannah-brown"></a></figure></div>
<p>In the video, she lip synced the words,&nbsp;&quot;That was embarrassing. I really hope you&#8217;re embarrassed. Wow.&quot;</p>
<p>In case it still wasn&#8217;t clear what situation she&#8217;s referring to, Hannah added a second caption:</p>
<p>&quot;Always trust your instincts, ladies,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But as upset as she might be, Hannah Ann probably appreciates Hannah Brown&#8217;s honesty,</p>
<p>&quot;I was so upset breaking up with him,&quot; <a href="https://people.com/tv/hannah-brown-hooked-up-with-peter-weber-while-his-bachelor-season-was-airing/">Brown told </a><em>People</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I know he really did care about me and he&#8217;s such a great guy. I was really confused.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Brown said she thought she was over Peter when she learned that he had been cast as the Bachelor, but she realized she was wrong once she paid a visit to the set.</p>
<p>&quot;Once I knew that, it helped shield my feelings for him,&quot; Brown recalled of the casting news.</p>
<p>&quot;I still didn&#8217;t know if I could get there with him,&quot; she added.</p>

<p>&quot;Going back and seeing him as the Bachelor, it brought up a lot,&quot; Hannah continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter told me he&#8217;d quit the show, 100 percent, if I could say that I wanted to be with him. I wanted to go on a date with him, but I couldn&#8217;t say that I knew for sure.&quot;</p>
<p>She added that after Peter&#8217;s season came to an end &#8212; but before he broke up with Hannah in order to <a href="/2020/04/peter-weber-slams-madison-prewett-stop-lying-and-show-me-some-re/">pursue a relationship Madison Prewett</a> &#8212; the two of them crossed paths at Hannah Godwin and Dylan Barbour&#8217;s engagement party.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that they were having troubles,&quot; Brown recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;He was like, &#8216;I have so much to tell you,&#8217;&quot; Brown recalls, writing in her book that the former couple ended up in bed together. &quot;The chemistry just wasn&#8217;t there,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>When <a href="/slideshows/hannah-brown-banged-in-a-windmill-and-twitter-loses-its-mind/">Hannah and Peter banged in a windmill </a>during her time as Bachelorette, she had nothing but rave reviews.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But she says the experience after their co-stars&#8217; engagement party was much less thrilling.</p>
<p>&quot;It just sucked. And then, I found out he had another girl [runner-up Madison Prewett] on his mind. It was all so bizarre,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Interestingly, Peter wound up alone after pursuing so many different women.</p>
<p>But hey, at least he&#8217;ll always have the company of his famously overbearing mom!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>As it turns out, four times was not enough for Hannah Brown and Peter Weber.</p>
<p>The former Bachelorette and her former suitor &#8212; who would go on himself to anchor a season of The Bachelor &#8212; famously slept together four times in one night back during Brown&#8217;s 2019 run as the lead of this franchise.</p>
<p>Four times. In one night. <a href="/slideshows/hannah-brown-banged-in-a-windmill-and-twitter-loses-its-mind/">Inside of a windmill</a>, we should add.</p>
<p>In the end, however, Brown sent Weber home a week before her finale aired&#8230; but she&#8217;s now made a bombshell confession.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The reality stars went home together many months later as well!</p>
<p>Brown, you see, broke up with fiance Jed Wyatt before her Bachelorette season even finished airing.</p>
<p>Then, in January 2020, Weber&#8217;s <em>Bachelor</em> season started airing, with Brown actually stopping by for an episode.</p>
<p>&quot;Going back and seeing him as the Bachelor, it brought up a lot,&quot; <a href="https://people.com/tv/hannah-brown-hooked-up-with-peter-weber-while-his-bachelor-season-was-airing/">Hannah now tells People Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Off camera, she added, &quot;Peter told me he&#8217;d quit the show, 100 percent, if I could say that I wanted to be with him. I wanted to go on a date with him, but I couldn&#8217;t say that I knew for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Weber, meanwhile, got engaged to Hannah Ann Sluss to close out his Bachelor season, but &quot;I&nbsp;heard that they were having troubles,&quot; Brown explained to People &#8212; prior to delving into what happened next.</p>
<p>At a February engagement party for Dylan Barbour and Hannah Godwin, Brown and Weber started talking, and then decided to do A LOT more than&nbsp; just talk.</p>
<p>&quot;He was like, &#8216;I have so much to tell you,&#8217;&quot; Brown recalls, writing in her memoir,&nbsp;<em>God Bless This Mess</em>, that the former couple ended up in bed together.</p>
<p>&quot;The chemistry just wasn&#8217;t there,&quot; she says. &quot;It just sucked. And then, I found out he had another girl [runner-up Madison Prewett] on his mind. It was all so bizarre.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Weber developed quite the reputation after he left The Bachelor, breaking up with Sluss, going out with Prewett and then getting involved in a relationship with yet <em>another</em> contestant from his season, Kelley Flanagan.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="/2021/05/kelley-flanagan-i-took-peter-weber-back-and-then-he-cheated-on-m/">Flanagan said she dumped Weberr after he cheated</a> on her a bunch of times.</p>
<p>As for Weber and Brown, the latter of whom has been dating Adam Woolard for a year?</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t spoken since the surprising bedroom romp revealed here.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Things might not have turned out the way I expected, but I try to learn from every moment,&quot; Brown told People. &quot;I don&#8217;t wish ill on anybody. And I&#8217;m in a really good place.&quot;</p>
<p>Hannah&#8217;s book, the full title of which is&nbsp;<em>God Bless This Mess: Learning to Live and Love Through Life&#8217;s Best (and Worst) Moments</em>,&nbsp;will be available to purchase on Tuesday, November 23.</p>
<p>When asked whether Weber got a heads-up about what she was revealing in the memoir, Brown told Us Weekly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not been a part of this process of writing this book.&rdquo;</p>
