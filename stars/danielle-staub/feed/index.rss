										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Despite leaving the franchise years ago, <a href="/2020/08/danielle-staub-says-andy-cohen-loves-drugs-and-orgies-and-really/">Danielle Staub has had a lot to say</a> about her time at Bravo.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s taken shots at Andy Cohen. Now, she has a new claim about her former castmate.</p>
<p>According to Danielle, Teresa Guidice once took a fight too far &#8212; even by <em>RHONJ </em>standards.</p>
<p>How? Tre allegedly stabbed Danielle <em>with a friggen fork</em>.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>People reporter David Quinn has come out with a tell-all book with a very lengthy title.</p>
<p>The book is <em>Not All Diamonds and Ros&eacute;: The Inside Story of the Real Housewives From the People Who Lived It</em>.</p>
<p>Quinn interviewed cast, producers, and network executives for a deep dive into the history of the infamous Bravo franchise.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Apparently, this all went down during a major fight back in 2010.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll spare you from doing the math &#8212; that was Season 2 of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>.</p>
<p>The blowout took place at a fashion show for Kim DePaola&#8217;s boutique, Posche.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It all started when Danielle called Jacqueline Laurita&#8217;s daughter, Ashley, a name &#8212; and not a nice one.</p>
<p>This led to a confrontation between Danielle and Teresa, who called her a &quot;bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle fired back with some sort of insult about Teresa&#8217;s finances.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-683x1024.jpg" alt="Danielle Staub Smiles" class="wp-image-305883" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/danielle-staub-smiles-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>According to what Danielle said in her interview, that fight became physical.</p>
<p>The Housewives are known for backstabbing, but this time, it was much more literal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teresa took a fork to my back!&quot; Danielle claimed in the interview, as cited in the book.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I had a fork stabbed and dragged down my back!&quot; Danielle described.</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; she continued, &quot;I stopped running.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the security guys was holding onto my arm,&quot; Danielle recalled.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I remember saying, &lsquo;Let go of me. You&rsquo;re holding me back,&#8217;&quot; Danielle narrated.</p>
<p>&quot;This was like Jerry Springer on steroids,&quot; she characterized.</p>
<p>Danielle continued: &quot;Like, these women were dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;It came as a shock to me,&quot; Danielle remarked, &quot;that I was allowed to be treated this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, that ugly physical fight never actually made it onto the show, even though it might have been ratings gold.</p>
<p>It was just too violent and too physical, as explained elsewhere in the same book.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like it when it gets physical,&rdquo; Andy Cohen explained in his interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tend to cut away from it,&quot; he shared.</p>
<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ll show that something happens,&quot; Andy said, &quot;but we kind of do flashes on the screen.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Andy recalls the incident, but it is not a fond memory.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not in keeping with what we want the Housewives to be,&quot; Andy expressed.</p>
<p>Notably, in addition to the alleged fork-stabbing by Teresa, Jaqueline Laurita&#8217;s then-teenage daughter Ashlee pulled Danielle&#8217;s hair.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Danielle filed criminal complaints against both women after the 2010 incident.</p>
<p>She ultimately dropped the complaint against Teresa.</p>
<p>Ashlee, though just a teenager at the time, was another story.</p>

<p>Danielle successfully pressed charges against Ashlee for the hair-pulling.</p>
<p>Jaqueline&#8217;s teenage daughter was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine.</p>
<p>Of course, the fine amounted to $189, so there were no real winners in any part of this story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Danielle Staub may be the most controversial Real Housewife in franchise history.</p>
<p>A lead cast member on&nbsp;The Real Housewives of New Jersey for two seasons, <a href="/2010/06/danielle-staub-sex-tape-available-soon/">Staub has appeared in multiple</a> sex tapes and once spent a month in jail for her alleged role in a kidnapping and extortion scandal.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s been at the center of many controversies.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>And yet:</p>
<p>Staub is now here, months after the final time she was a member of the Bravo family, to say that her past is absolutely <em>nothing</em> when compared to the present of host and producer Andy Cohen.</p>
<p>The 58-year old posted a lengthy statement about her previous business partnership with Cohen via Instagram on Wednesday, August 26&#8230; while promoting her podcast, &ldquo;Absolutely Danielle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Editor&#8217;s Note: That title needs a lot of work.)</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am no longer forced to walk into the Lions Den,&rdquo; Staub began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy kept me In the dark long enough! He has taken whats mine and given it to others!&quot;</p>
<p>She then referenced <a href="/2019/02/andy-cohen-welcomes-first-child-see-the-precious-photo/">Cohen becoming a dad</a> and continued:</p>
<p>&quot;Now that you are a parent I&rsquo;d hoped you would see some of the pain you caused my family, even when I left the show to protect my young children, you mocked me repeatedly defaming me and yet I still continued to give you over a decade to do right by me and mine!&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Staub was far from finished, too:</p>
<p>&quot;Now it&rsquo;s time you understand that &lsquo;for every action there is a reaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&quot;You must&rsquo;ve seen this coming and YOU know you were wrong, yet you continued.</p>
<p>&quot;So for all the times you held me down and picked me apart instead of building me up and standing with me, for all the times you made me stand alone &lsquo;kept me in the dark,&rsquo; may you tread lightly in your own darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;&lsquo;For letting me be the last to know&rsquo; may you learn to do better.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Naked Truth author also alleged fans &ldquo;mirror [Cohen&rsquo;s] behavior&rdquo; toward her but she said he never stood up for her.</p>
<p>As you can see below, Staub also claimed Cohen goes on multiple Grindr dates per night and partakes in the occasional hard drug use.</p>
<p>To be clear, however, Danielle only cites &quot;reputable sources&quot; here.</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t say she has any first-hand knowledge of these activities or habits.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you to revere me,&rdquo; Staub addded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve even gone as far as to ask you to be kinder and more gentle with me but it fell on deaf ears. No more waiting or asking,</p>
<p>&quot;I have no hate no more respect I don&rsquo;t honor you and I won&rsquo;t defend you.</p>
<p>&quot;But I will advise: &lsquo;Be careful whose toes you step on today because they may be attached to the ass you have to kiss tomorrow.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>These harsh claims come seven months after the Staub announced her exit from Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be never returning as a Housewife again with the Jersey girls,&rdquo; she said on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in January.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, over the past 12 years and 10 seasons, been a part of this whole franchise and I&rsquo;ve been very happy to rally and stand on a platform and be here with all of you.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is time for me to leave and do something that I want to do that makes my heart happy every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staub co-starred on Real Housewives of New Jersey as an an original cast member on seasons 1 and 2.</p>
<p>She departed the series before season 3 after she had a falling out with <a href="/stars/teresa-giudice/">Teresa Giudice</a>.</p>
<p>The pair made amends in 2016, and Staub returned as a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; role in seasons 8, 9 and 10.</p>
<p>Cohen, meanwhile, has not yet responded to any of Staub&#8217;s allegations.</p>

<p>Not only did Teresa Giudice tell estranged husband Joe that their&nbsp;<a href="/videos/joe-giudice-i-knew-my-marriage-was-over-when-teresa-wouldnt-bang/">marriage was effectively over,</a> but she was also confronted about her involvement in the violent incident with Danielle Staub.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="990" height="755" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive.png" alt="Teresa Giudice is Apprehensive" class="wp-image-342542" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive.png 990w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-300x229.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-768x586.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-735x561.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-335x255.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-347x265.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-520x397.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-640x488.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-960x732.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>You know, the one in which Danielle attacked Margaret Josephs by pulleding her hair at a boutique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps for the best,&nbsp;<a href="/videos/teresa-giudice-ends-friendship-with-danielle-and-marriage-with-j/">Teresa and Danielle are no longer friends</a>&nbsp;due to the aftermath of the catfight.</p>
<p>And Teresa wants everyone to know that despite reports, she played no part in the classless act.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/danielle-staub-friggen-drags-margaret-josephs-by-the-hair"></a></figure>
<p>Giudice is said to be&nbsp;<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/02/27/teresa-giudice-danielle-staub-friends-never-again/">upset with producers</a> for airing a clip that implied Teresa put her co-star up to this behavior.</p>
<p><em>TBH, I wish my life was a reality show so every time I made a mistake I could just blame it on a cameraman. </em></p>
<p><em>How dare you, Jeff!</em></p>
<p>But seriously folks, it&#8217;s not just the production team Teresa has an issue with here.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Danielle claiming that Teresa told her to pull Margaret&#8217;s hair is the very thing that ended their friendship and Teresa feels like it all got taken the wrong way,&quot; a source recently spilled to <em>Hollywood Life</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;She doesn&#8217;t see them being friends ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She felt after the table flip and they moved past that, that they&#8217;d always be friends, but she really stands by the fact that the way Danielle is telling the story is not what happened.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And even though there is literal footage, Teresa is still sticking to her &quot;truth.&quot; The source adds:</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;s aware there is footage and it&#8217;s been seen by fans, but she feels the footage that came out and what actually happened are two different stories.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She feels like she wasn&#8217;t even paying attention to Danielle and their conversation about hair-pulling.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, Teresa defended herself in the original clip by saying she was &quot;drinking&quot; and that &quot;everything happened so fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and by <a href="/videos/teresa-giudice-gets-exposed-throws-her-drink-flips-the-eff-out/">throwing that unforgettable tantrum</a> that would have a 4-year-old beat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, was she too drunk to remember or just not paying attention?</p>
<p>Either way, she wasn&#8217;t happy with how the producers made her look.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="831" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-1024x831.png" alt="Teresa Giudice Discusses Joe" class="wp-image-341781" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-1024x831.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-300x243.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-768x623.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-735x596.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-335x272.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-347x282.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-520x422.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-640x519.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-960x779.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe-1080x876.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-discusses-joe.png 1119w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The insider close to the situation explained:</p>
<p>&quot;She never thought it would turn into what it did. She honestly doesn&#8217;t even remember it happening and feels set up and upset by production over this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teresa would never physically assault anyone,&quot; the source continued. &quot;Teresa finally saw what the other ladies have been saying about Danielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems a lot of them do believe that it didn&#8217;t go down how Danielle says it did, either.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>FWIW, unseen <em>RHONJ</em> footage aired on Wednesday, February 19 and showed Giudice urging Danielle to pull Margaret&#8217;s hair.</p>
<p>The whole thing quickly became one of the most controversial scandals on the Bravo show, and it&#8217;s easy to see why.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s all he-said-she-said. And attacking someone <em>(yes, especially hair pulling!)</em> is never the answer.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we showed you in a previous sneak peek,&nbsp;<a href="/videos/teresa-giudice-gets-exposed-throws-her-drink-flips-the-eff-out/">Teresa Giudice threw her drink and a tantrum</a>&nbsp;when her bad behavior was brought to light.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>RHONJ</em>, she ended her friendship with Danielle Staub and tells her husband Joe that their marriage is effectively over.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="990" height="755" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive.png" alt="Teresa Giudice is Apprehensive" class="wp-image-342542" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive.png 990w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-300x229.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-768x586.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-735x561.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-335x255.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-347x265.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-520x397.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-640x488.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/02/teresa-giudice-is-apprehensive-960x732.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;She said that?&quot; Teresa asked after a too-long pause after Melissa Gorge tells the group that Danielle said that <a href="/videos/danielle-staub-teresa-giudice-told-me-to-beat-up-margaret-joseph/">Teresa told her to pull Margaret&#8217;s hair</a>.</p>
<p>After a while, and only after pressure from Melissa, Teresa stammered: &quot;I don&#8217;t even&#8230; I remember her saying something to me&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was drinking,&quot; she eventually said in her defense. &quot;And everything happened so fast.&quot;</p>
<p>The faces of shock and horror at Teresa&#8217;s reluctant admission &#8230; well, we just had to turn that into a gif.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m a little freaked out. I&#8217;m not gonna lie,&quot; Margaret Josephs admitted. &quot;Why would you ever tell her to pull my hair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How sick is that?&quot; she asked Teresa. &quot;You f&#8211;king love this girl so much that you&#8217;re gonna f&#8211;king just let her hurt me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For what? For what? You&#8217;re a real f&#8211;king asshole,&quot; Margaret accused. &quot;I&#8217;m like f&#8211;king freaked out.&quot;</p>
<p>Her freakout is understandable, especially because it came just moments after she told Teresa that she <em>knew </em>that she&#8217;d never tell Danielle to hurt her.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;This is your f&#8211;king friend? This is who you wanna associate with?&quot; Margaret demanded to know.</p>
<p>&quot;She just threw you under the bus in front of the f&#8211;king world to save her own f&#8211;king ass,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;How sick is that?&quot;</p>
<p>This is when Dolores chimed in: &quot;You have been going to bat for [Danielle] since day one, and look what the f&#8211;k she just did to you.&quot;</p>
<p>A distressed and betrayed Margaret stormed off.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I mean, I feel bad,&quot; Teresa meekly expressed. The whole time, she looked like a deer in headlights.</p>
<p>Noticing the cameras, she added: &quot;I hope they don&#8217;t use this.&quot;</p>
<p>Melissa pointed out the obvious: &quot;They are gonna use it.&quot; It&#8217;s literally why the cameras are there, Tre.</p>
<p>At this, Teresa freaked out, flipped off the camera, threw her drink, knocked over other drinks, and stormed away, furious with the producers.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;You guys are f&#8211;king a&#8211;holes,&quot; she declared at the camera operators. &quot;I&#8217;m going home!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave me the f&#8211;k alone!&quot; Teresa demanded as the cameras and producers followed her. &quot;I&#8217;m so f&#8211;king mad right now.&quot;</p>
<p>She then shared that she was &quot;calling an Uber and going home&quot; in the hopes that she would be able to &quot;calm down.&quot;</p>
<p>Sort of odd to say that you&#8217;re the one who needs to calm down when you&#8217;re the bad guy in the situation.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Margaret had to ask the obvious question.</p>
<p>She wondered if Teresa was upset &quot;because she looks like an a&#8211;hole to everybody, or because she really hurt me?&quot;</p>
<p>Melissa offered that Teresa was &quot;embarrassed.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, that much is true.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Teresa initially refused to appear on camera, leaving her friends to plead with her through the door.</p>
<p>Dolores advised her to make this right by apologizing to Margaret.</p>
<p>She also wisely suggested that Teresa cut ties with Danielle.</p>
<p>Melissa acknowledged that Teresa has a lot of stress at home and within her family, but echoed the sentiment that she should stop associating with Danielle.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Alright, maybe you did me a favor for going to meet with her,&quot; Teresa admitted to Melissa as she opened the door.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you guys were all f&#8211;king right,&quot; she acknowledged. &quot;Believe me, I was happy that Danielle stuck up for herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She never stuck up for herself,&quot; Teresa pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m just really upset right now &#8217;cause of Margaret,&quot; she explained. &quot;I feel like I let her down. I just wanna leave.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Teresa told the camera the same thing that she had told her friends, that she had been &quot;drinking a lot&quot; and that it all happened so quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not gonna lie,&quot; she added in the confessional, &quot;I was angry at Margaret.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never thought anybody would get hurt,&quot; Teresa emphasized.</p>
<p>She acknowledged: &quot;I wasn&#8217;t even thinking.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m really upset, Danielle,&quot; Teresa said after calling her. &quot;Melissa just told me what you did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honey, don&#8217;t be mad about this, please,&quot; pleaded Danielle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teresa countered: &quot;I am! Don&#8217;t be mad? &#8216;Cause now Margaret&#8217;s gonna think that I told you to hurt her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you agreed with it,&quot; Danielle argued.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Teresa hit back: &quot;I didn&#8217;t agree with attacking someone. That was your f&#8211;king decision, and then afterwards, what did I tell you afterwards?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You said I shouldn&#8217;t have done it,&quot; Danielle admitted. &quot;You wish I hadn&#8217;t done it.&quot;</p>
<p>Teresa expressed: &quot;I&#8217;m so mad at myself. I don&#8217;t ever wanna hurt anybody again. It&#8217;s f&#8211;ked up. I&#8217;m not like that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Don&#8217;t be mad at me, Tre. Don&#8217;t let this come between us,&quot; Danielle begged her,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you all the best, I just don&#8217;t wanna be friends anymore,&quot; Teresa told her. &quot;I had enough. Alright, bye.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She then hung up the phone just as Danielle was telling her that she loves her.</p>
<p>Oh no this actually made me sad. Like, it&#8217;s good that Teresa then apologized to Margaret, but still.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Meanwhile, we then see Teresa on her family trip to Italy to see Joe, where Joe finds out that his sleeping arrangements are not as expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I mean, were you expecting to sleep with me?&quot; an incredulous Teresa asks him, followed by an uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p>Joe eventually breaks the silence with: &quot;I mean, we got what 20 years in our marriage?&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="936" height="761" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over.png" alt="Joe Giudice Realizes That It's Over" class="wp-image-345435" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over.png 936w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-300x244.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-768x624.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-735x598.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-335x272.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-347x282.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-520x423.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-realizes-that-its-over-640x520.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Alright, Joe, listen,&quot; Teresa reasons. &quot;We haven&#8217;t been together in almost four years, so it&#8217;s kinda weird, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Joe senses what&#8217;s happening, and says: &quot;I don&#8217;t know, I mean, it&#8217;s been a long time, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>She advises him: &quot;You need to, like, slow it down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, listen,&quot; Joe replies, &quot;by the end of this trip, things could change. Who the hell knows?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I think Joe wants to be a couple again, but I haven&#8217;t been happy with Joe for a long time,&quot; Teresa explains to the camera.</p>
<p>&quot;But when I first got married to Joe, everything was great,&quot; she affirms.</p>
<p>&quot;And I truly do not want to hurt him,&quot; Teresa adds, &quot;but sometimes, you can&#8217;t get over what happened, and you just need to move on.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Joe suggests that they could keep the marriage alive somehow.</p>
<p>He says that they could &quot;get on a plane and we meet places, that&#8217;s all. And we have fun. And that&#8217;s what we do. We make things work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t want that,&quot; Teresa tells him. &quot;I want somebody with me every single day.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe notes that his deportation case is still technically open, and wants to wait it out, saying: &quot;Maybe it&#8217;ll make our relationship stronger,&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="786" height="642" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad.png" alt="Joe Giudice is Visibly Sad" class="wp-image-345434" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad.png 786w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-300x245.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-768x627.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-735x600.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-335x274.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-347x283.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-520x425.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/joe-giudice-is-visibly-sad-640x523.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;The past five years have been really dark,&quot; Teresa tells him. &quot;You&#8217;ve said a lot of hurtful things to me.&quot;</p>
<p>She recalls: &quot;you wish you would&#8217;ve never married me and all this other stuff. It just makes me think about a lot of things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, you marry somebody, and they&#8217;re supposed to protect you,&quot; Teresa argues. &quot;I don&#8217;t know. I trusted you, and you made s&#8211;t happen.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Joe then asks her if she just wants to &quot;end it now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want me to lie to you?&quot; she asks. When he says &quot;no,&quot; she states: &quot;I guess that&#8217;s it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s so infuriating to me,&quot; Teresa tells the camera. &quot;After four years of both of us doing time, he still does not take responsibility for what he&#8217;s done. He hasn&#8217;t changed.&quot;</p>
<p>That said, neither of them seem to know how they&#8217;ll tell their four daughters about this development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Viewers of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> were all horrified to see <a href="/videos/danielle-staub-friggen-drags-margaret-josephs-by-the-hair/">Danielle Staub drag Margaret Josephs by the hair</a>.</p>
<p>She went way too far, no question.</p>
<p>Now, Danielle has revealed that Teresa Giudice was egging her on before the assault &#8212; and it was all caught on video.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As you can see in this brief clip that we have included, Melissa Gorga sat down with Danielle to deliver a difficiult message.</p>
<p>She tells Danielle that no one wants her around because she is &quot;violent.&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle fires back, asking: &quot;Does that include Teresa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teresa also knows that I&#8217;m here,&quot; Melissa replies. &quot;Teresa does enjoy your company. I think you make her laugh, Danielle.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;But you know what?&quot; Melissa tells her. &quot;I don&#8217;t think Teresa&#8217;s in her right mind right now, let&#8217;s be honest. &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>She asks: &quot;Do you think you&#8217;re the right person for her if you&#8217;re gonna go and pull people&#8217;s hair in her presence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we&#8217;d all had a lot to drink. I was also influenced. I was done when I emptied Margaret&#8217;s bag in the candle,&quot; Danielle explains.</p>
<p>&quot;I was finished,&quot; she says. &quot;But then Steven told me I should go pull her hair.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Steven, the owner of the boutique?&quot; Melissa asks, seeking clarification.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Staub admits. &quot;When Steven said do it, I hesitated, and then I looked at Teresa and she said, &#8216;Yeah, do it.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you&#8217;re saying Teresa told you to pull her hair?&quot; a genuinely flummoxed Melissa asks.</p>
<p>Danielle replies: &quot;Yes.&quot; We then see video of exactly what Danielle just described.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Elsewhere in the episode, Jackie Goldschneider challenged the other gals to a beer-drinking contest and won &#8230; if you consider drinking beer to be a win.</p>
<p>Jennifer Aydin teased her: &quot;You know how to suck a bottle, but you can&#8217;t suck a dick?!&quot;</p>
<p>See, Jackie had recently admitted that she doesn&#8217;t have much oral sex in her marriage, but clearly did not appreciate having it brought up.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#8217;t even with her. It&#8217;s offensive,&quot; Margaret Josephs expressed, aghast.</p>

<p>Jennifer told Margaret to &quot;relax&quot; because, after all, &quot;it was a joke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jennifer, read the room! You&#8217;ve offended many people, and you did offend me this morning,&quot; Margaret fired back.</p>
<p>Jennifer then opined that Magaret, not she, is the one who is &quot;always starting&quot; conflicts.</p>
<p>The subject moved to Teresa, which then spiraled into some vicious discourse about motherhood and working.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;you work?&quot; Margaret asks Jennifer, challenging her.</p>
<p>This is when Jennifer&#8217;s husband, Bill, comes to her defense, correctly saying: &quot;Every mom works.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I may not get paid for my job, but I work,&quot; Jennifer replies.</p>
<p>Bill correctly opines: &quot;It is a freaking profession.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;You don&#8217;t work outside the home,&quot; Margaret clarifies.</p>
<p>&quot;Bitch, I work a 14-hour day, honey!&quot; Jennifer says. &quot;It doesn&#8217;t end until my kids go to sleep, and then I&#8217;m off the clock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t know what type of mother&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;were,&quot; Jennifer asks, &quot;but I&#8217;m a very hands-on mother.&quot;</p>
<p>Margaret&#8217;s strained relationship with her stepchildren (because she cheated on their dad, whoops) is no secret. She was pissed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="941" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-941x1024.png" alt="Margaret Josephs" class="wp-image-285862" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-941x1024.png 941w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-276x300.png 276w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-768x836.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-735x800.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-308x335.png 308w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-319x347.png 319w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-478x520.png 478w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-588x640.png 588w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-706x768.png 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-882x960.png 882w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs-992x1080.png 992w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/margaret-josephs.png 1086w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;You just insulted my mothering skills,&quot; Margaret accuses. &quot;You said you don&#8217;t know what kind of mother I was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s just a fact,&quot; Jennifer retorts.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of everything that you&#8217;re going through now,&quot; she asks, &quot;everyone&#8217;s supposed to feel bad and coddle your feelings?&quot;</p>
<p>Melissa speaks up, warning Jennifer that she&#8217;s &quot;going into extremely dangerous territory.&quot; It&#8217;s true.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I pull myself up by my bootstraps. Do I ever ask anybody to coddle my feelings?&quot; Margaret fires at Jennifer, while beginning to stand.</p>
<p>She then describes Jennifer as &quot;A girl who f&#8211;king never worked a day in her life?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my God, why don&#8217;t you sit down?!&quot; Jennifer yells, only to be answered by more yelling and some finger-waving.</p>
<p>&quot;The only achievement you&#8217;ve ever had is marrying someone rich! You&#8217;re lucky he stays with you!&quot; Margaret screeches, horrifying everyone else.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jennifer yells: &quot;You need to stop taking things so seriously!&quot;</p>
<p>Margaret maybe realized that she had gone too far, because she finally, too late, decided to bite her tongue.</p>
<p>Jennifer did not, and yelled: &quot;Fred Flinstone called! He wants his outfit back! Biotch!&quot; in reference to Margaret&#8217;s cheetah print.</p>
<p>Margaret replied that Jennifer was &quot;classless&quot; and &quot;disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p>There are really, truly no heroes in this story. Everybody sucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fresh off of the heels of <a href="/videos/danielle-staub-friggen-drags-margaret-josephs-by-the-hair/">Danielle Staub&#8217;s public brawl with Margaret Josephs</a> airing on television, she has a stunning announcement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that she&#8217;s leaving <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>. Danielle adds a detail that leaves Andy speechless.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Danielle Staub was a guest on <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>, where not even Andy knew the full extent of what she planned to say.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;ve got an announcement to make,&quot; Andy prompts. &quot;Tell us what you&#8217;re thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have, over the past 12 years and 10 seasons, been a part of this whole franchise,&quot; Danielle begins.</p>
<p>We have included the video for your convenience. You really have to see Andy&#8217;s face journey for yourself.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Danielle continues: &quot;And I&#8217;ve been very happy to rally and stand on the platform and be here with all of you,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it is time for me to leave,&quot; she shares.</p>
<p>Danielle then adds: &quot;and do something that I want to do.&quot;</p>
<p>She will go into detail on that front, never fear.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Danielle shares that her next venture will be something &quot;that makes my heart happy every day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so,&quot; she proclaims, &quot;I will be never returning as a &#8216;Housewife&#8217; again&#8211;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never?!&quot; asks a shocked and stunned Andy.</p>
<p>He knew that she was quitting. He never imagined that it was for good.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="927" height="787" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked.png" alt="Andy Cohen is Shocked" class="wp-image-341042" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked.png 927w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-300x255.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-768x652.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-735x624.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-335x284.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-347x295.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-520x441.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/01/andy-cohen-is-shocked-640x543.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Wow, she&#8217;s saying the word n&#8211; Okay, I didn&#8217;t know you were going to say the word never,&quot; Andy confesses.</p>
<p>But Danielle has a major clarification.</p>
<p>&quot;No, never returning as a &#8216;Housewife&#8217; again,&quot; she confirms, then adding, &quot;With the Jersey girls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so you&#8217;re open to New York, and . . .&quot; Andy points out as the audience responds.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s amazing,&quot; Andy remarks. &quot;What will you do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to start my own cooking channel,&quot; Danielle shares, returning to what Andy knew was coming.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s great,&quot; he praises. &quot;You have been cooking up a storm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am loving it,&quot; she gushes. &quot;Cooking is therapy to me, so I&#8217;m basically calling it Cooking Therapy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I find my peace in the kitchen,&quot; Danielle expresses, &quot;and I cook for some of Jillian&#8217;s friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#8217;re over weekly &#8212; they were just over every night during the holidays,&quot; she notes.</p>
<p>&quot;But there&#8217;s up to 30 kids that might stop by,&quot; Danielle notes, &quot;and I want to have food for everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a point of pride for her. Food is a common love language.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="945" height="886" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return.png" alt="Danielle Staub Makes a Return" class="wp-image-279157" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return.png 945w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-300x281.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-768x720.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-735x689.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-335x314.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-347x325.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-520x488.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-makes-a-return-640x600.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I promised there would always be pasta over the 21 years that I&#8217;ve known these children,&quot; Danielle shares, beaming.</p>
<p>&quot;They stop over, and I&#8217;m &#8216;mom,&#8217; and I feed them,&quot; she shares, &quot;and even if they go out, they come home early and eat.&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle describes herself as being &quot;all in for food.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of us don&#8217;t see much of ourselves in Danielle, which is why she is so entertaining on television, but that, at least, is relatable.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="444" height="594" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey.jpg" alt="Danielle Staub Attends Wine Tasting In New Jersey" class="wp-image-244794" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey.jpg 444w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey-224x300.jpg 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey-240x320.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey-250x335.jpg 250w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey-259x347.jpg 259w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/danielle-staub-attends-wine-tasting-in-new-jersey-389x520.jpg 389w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;And I think food is sexy,&quot; Danielle remarks, &quot;but it&#8217;s gluten- and dairy-free.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of food, Andy ends the clip by saying that he&#8217;s going to &quot;digest&quot; Danielle&#8217;s permanent retirement from <em>RHONJ </em>during the commercial break.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Danielle just decided to drop off of the show or if her physical fight with Margaret had some role to play.</p>
<p>Regardless, we can all admit that seeing her cook would at least be worth checking out.</p>
<p>In the mean time, which new <em>Real Housewives</em> show do we think that Danielle should join?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Months before <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> were <a href="/2019/12/teresa-giudice-separates-from-joe-the-real-housewives-react/">reacting to Teresa separating from Joe</a>, they were reacting to each other.</p>
<p>An intense confrontation between Margaret and Danielle turned violent when Danielle grabbed Margaret&#8217;s hair and <em>dragged </em>her.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Housewives were out shopping. We all know that rich people can be obnoxious, but no high end clothing store expects to host a <em>brawl</em>.</p>
<p>Things were already heating up between Danielle Staub and Margaret Josephs when Margeret&#8217;s friend tried to pull her out of the verbal spat.</p>
<p>Jackie Goldschneider advised Margaret that Danielle was &quot;not worth it&quot; because, well, &quot;she&#8217;s a piece of s&#8211;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle flipped out, exclaiming: &quot;I&#8217;m not worth it?! I&#8217;m a piece of s&#8211;t?!&quot; She waved her finger in Margaret&#8217;s face.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Margaret was quick to furiously establish a boundary, demanding to Danielle: &quot;Don&#8217;t f&#8211;king touch me!&quot;</p>
<p>Seeing her chance to convince Teresa of Danielle&#8217;s true nature, Margaret spoke of her to Teresa.</p>
<p>She characterized: &quot;Teresa, she&#8217;s been dragged and ridden hard, and that&#8217;s all I have to say.&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle heard that, and fired: &quot;Oh, baby, and so have your f&#8211;king titties! You should get &#8217;em done!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Margaret&#8217;s response was simple and a clear escalation: she overturned her water onto Danielle&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>Again, they are just in a normal upscale clothing outlet. Other customers were just there to shop.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I hit a nerve?!&quot; Danielle asked. &quot;Did I f&#8211;king hit a f&#8211;king nerve, you f&#8211;king c&#8211;t?!&quot;</p>
<p>One ill turn deserves another, Danielle decided, because she didn&#8217;t settle for hurling the C-word at Margaret.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Danielle snatched Margaret&#8217;s purse, but her intent was more than simple thievery.</p>
<p>Taking to a coffee table in that same store (again, a clothing store that was open for business), Danielle emptied the purse&#8217;s contents.</p>
<p>Some of the items were deliberately broken during the process.</p>
<p>Those that weren&#8217;t, she dumped onto a candle, hoping to burn or otherwise ruin them.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice watched on in wonder as this extremely bad behavior went down.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re f&#8211;king even!&quot; Danielle announced as Margaret walked over to quietly collect her destroyed, singed belongings.</p>
<p>&quot;Watch your back, b&#8211;ch!&quot; she added. &quot;You started it? I&#8217;ll f&#8211;king finish it. Don&#8217;t you ever f&#8211;king come for me again, you f&#8211;king whore!&quot;</p>
<p>Dolores rushed over to help with the cleanup while an understandably mortified Melissa apologized to everyone, especially retail employees.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Melissa blew up at Danielle about feeling embarrassed, saying: &quot;Yes, I f&#8211;king am! This is nuts! Are you not?!&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle challenged her, asking: &quot;Did you see what she did to me?!&quot;</p>
<p>Despite Jennifer&#8217;s pleas that Teresa not get involved, she got up in Melissa&#8217;s face, pointing at Margaret.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s your f&#8211;king friend!&quot; she shouted. &quot;She started it! You f&#8211;king poured the water! Why would you f&#8211;king do that?!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Margaret gave Danielle a withering look and told her to &quot;Take your drowned rat self and go back in your hole and go.&quot;</p>
<p>Danielle fired back that Margaret should go ahead and &quot;go with your white f&#8211;king ponytail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#8217;t even bleach it anymore your hair&#8217;s so f&#8211;king broken!&quot; she claimed. &quot;I just can&#8217;t help myself anymore. I really can&#8217;t.&quot;</p>
<p>This is when Danielle strolled across the room, grabbed Margaret by the ponytail, and began dragging her as the screen went dark. Yikes.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Call me a weeb for this remark if you like, but this still gives me flashbacks to how anime episodes end. Danielle is so over-the-top.</p>
<p>Also, did you know that assault is a crime?</p>
<p>On the aftershow, Margaret expressed embarassment and regret over the entire incident.</p>
<p>Danielle expressed no regrets, and said that destroying some of Margaret&#8217;s possessions the way that she did made her feel good.</p>
