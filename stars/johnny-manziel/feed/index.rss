										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last week, Johnny Football announced that he&#8217;d like for his nickname to stop being an ironic punchline.</p>
<p>After years of being synonymous with disappointment, former Cleveland Browns quarterback and current &#8220;Gronk, but way douchier and without the talent&#8221; Johnny Manziel stated that he wants back in the NFL.</p>
<p>In a series of candid tweets and interviews, <a href="/2017/01/johnny-manziel-i-was-a-drunk-douche-but-im-better-now/">Manziel vowed to sober up</a>, admitted he was &#8220;#LostInTheSauce&#8221; during his last stint in the league, and promised to do what it takes to avoid controversy and focus on the sport he loves.</p>

<p>To say he&#8217;s not off to a great start would be putting it mildly.</p>
<p>About 72 hours after assuring fans and scouts that his days of making tabloid headlines are through, Manziel decided to counsel Donald Trump on how to avoid the haters, then deleted his account amidst the totally predictable backlash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo, POTUS even I know to stay away from the notifications section on twitter. S&#8212; will drive you crazy, lead the country and let them hate,&#8221; Manziel tweeted Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>He followed that up with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Control what you can control and let the rest fall by the wayside.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure why anyone in any field would want to take any advice from Johnny effing Manziel, and apparently the 24-year-old doesn&#8217;t even want to heed his own words, as deleted his account minuted later, after his notifications went through the roof.</p>
<p>Far be it for us to defend the tiny-fisted harbinger of doom who&#8217;s currently aiming a legislative Death Star at the rights you hold dear, but if there&#8217;s one thing President Trump doesn&#8217;t need advice on, it&#8217;s how to use social media.</p>
<p>Like all sane Americans, we wish Trump would stop publicly <a href="/2016/11/donald-trump-presidency-is-reality-tv-to-blame/">griping about TV ratings</a> (since, ya know, he&#8217;s the president and all), but to his credit, the guy basically tweeted his way into the White House.</p>
<p>Johnny Manziel, meanwhile, is off someplace plotting a cold pill heist with Ryan Leaf.</p>

<p>Maybe the guy who once posted a photo of himself holding bags of cocaine on Instagram isn&#8217;t the guy you want to turn to to help you master this social media thing.</p>
<p>Stick to football, Johnny.</p>
<p>Those Calgary Stampeders aren&#8217;t gonna win the Grey Cup on their own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Johnny Manziel&#8217;s downward spiral continued last week, when the disgraced QB was spotted hanging out with troubled reality star Scott Disick at 1 Oak in Vegas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TMZ <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/08/johnny-manziel-praises-scott-disick-during-another-l-a-party-night/">caught up with Manziel </a>in LA Monday night as he made his way from The Nice Guy to the Ace of Diamonds strip club.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Johnny Football didn&#8217;t have much to say about his recent career and legal troubles, but he opened right up when the conversation turned to his new buddy Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lord knows what&#8217;s up,&quot; a raspy-voiced Manziel excitedly told the pap when asked about his friendship with Disick.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, but if you&#8217;re a Browns fan, or just someone who&#8217;s concerned about Manziel&#8217;s well-being, it&#8217;s not great news that he&#8217;s BFFs with &quot;the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="/2016/03/scott-disick-no-longer-allowed-to-see-his-kids-after-latest-rela/">Disick announced that he&#8217;s drinking again</a>, despite having completed his sixth stint in rehab late last year.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/02/johnny-manziel-enters-rehab-seeks-to-improve-himself/">Manziel entered rehab</a> last month, but as you can see, he&#8217;s clearly not too concerned about maintaining his sobriety.</p>
<p>Given the recent allegations that <a href="/2016/02/johnny-manziel-denies-abusing-girlfriend-threatening-suicide/">Manziel assaulted his girlfriend</a> and threatened to commit suicide during a recent bender, you would think he&#8217;d be trying his best to keep his nose clean, but obviously&nbsp;that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old&#8217;s family has publicly begged him to seek treatment, and he may not have a job with the Browns for much longer, but it seems there&#8217;s not much that can convince Manziel to stay off the bottle.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the decade-older Disick&nbsp;will sit him down and say, &quot;Hey, you have a career and I don&#8217;t. Let me do the boozing for both of us.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>It was just over a year ago that <a href="/2015/02/johnny-manziel-enters-rehab-seeks-to-improve-himself/">Johnny Manziel entered rehab</a> with the stated intention of &#8220;improving&#8221; himself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for Manziel, his fans, and the Cleveland Browns franchise, self-improvement remains elusive for the troubled quarterback.</p>

<p>Today, Manziel is speaking out for the first time following allegations that he recently assaulted his girlfriend, resulting in a melee so loud that <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/02/04/johnny-manziel-police-report-he-hit-me-several-times-gf-told-cops/">neighbors called police </a>out of concern for her safety.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Manziel claims he was never violent with longtime partner Colleen Crowley.</p>
<p>When asked about the incident by TMZ Sports, the man dubbed &#8220;Johnny Football&#8221; replied simply, &#8220;It didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for a claim in the police report that Manziel threatened to kill himself during his fight with Crowley, the 23-year-old Heisman Trophy winner insists it&#8217;s pure fabrication.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m completely stable,&#8221; Manziel says. &#8220;I&#8217;m safe and secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the allegations from Crowley are just the latest in a long line of line of troubles for Manziel, ranging from reports of drug use to violent <a href="/2014/11/johnny-manziel-involved-in-massive-brawl-with-fans/">brawls involving fans</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;ve been having fun but I just need to get my body right,&#8221; Manziel said in his statement to the website. &#8220;I&#8217;m 100% committed to playing football.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police investigation into the events of January 30 has concluded, and Manziel will not be charged with any crimes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Maybe we should re-nickname him Johnny Tabloid, because it seems the Cleveland Browns&#8217; disappointing QB is making headlines just about everything <em>but</em> football these days.</p>
<p>Before his brief and thoroughly unmemorable first NFL season even began, <a href="/2014/07/johnny-manziel-caught-using-cocaine-in-vegas-nightclub/">Johnny Manziel was caught using cocaine</a> (allegedly) in a Vegas nightclub.</p>
<p>Then, in November,<a href="/2014/11/johnny-manziel-involved-in-massive-brawl-with-fans/"> Manziel was involved in a massive brawl with fans</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we can notch up another one for Manziel in the one statistical category in which he dominated the league this year &#8211; embarrassing nightclub incidents!</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s being reported today that <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2015/01/05/johnny-manziel-drinks-thrown-at-qb-at-houston-nightclub/">Manziel was involved in yet another drunken dust-up</a> over the weekend. This one took place at Dekan nightclub in Houston, TX.</p>
<p>A club promoter identified only as JR related the epic tale to TMZ, and it sounds an awful lot like a Johnny Football story we&#8217;ve heard too many times before:</p>
<p>Apparently, some club patrons being loudly joking about Manziel&#8217;s lackluster season. The joking escalated to heckling, and Manziel threw the crowd an angry middle finger.</p>
<p>The crowd responded by hurling drinks at Manziel, and that&#8217;s when things got out of hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ducked and I looked at Johnny and we grabbed security and they ran us out of there,&#8221; says JR.</p>
<p>The drink-throwers were tossed out of the club, while Manziel changed out of his booze-soaked attire and returned to party some more.</p>
<p>In fairness, it sounds like this one wasn&#8217;t actually Johnny Football&#8217;s fault, but still &#8211; given his long history of nightclub ugliness you&#8217;d think the dude would just stick to drinking at home.</p>

<p>Just last week, <a href="/2014/07/justin-bieber-parties-with-johnny-manziel-cops-get-called-twice/">Manziel was partying with Justin Bieber</a> and the festivities were so rowdy that cops were called to the scene on two separate occasions.</p>
<p>Prior to that, of course, <a href="/2013/08/johnny-manziel-under-investigation-for-profiting-from-autograph/">Manziel was investigated for selling autographs</a> to fans, a major violation of NCAA rules.</p>
<p>Now, it seems the so-called Johnny Football may have been caught preparing to snort cocaine in a Las Vegas nightclub.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          

<p>The above photo was taken by an anonymous clubgoer over the weekend and posted to Twitter yesterday. </p>
<p>While it certainly doesn&#8217;t provide any conclusive evidence of drug use, Manziel can clearly be seen rolling s $20 bill into a straw-like tube, a common practice amongst cocaine users in need of homemade paraphernalia.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Manziel has yet to respond to the substance abuse allegations, or even confirm or deny that he <em>is</em> the man in the photo, but several media outlets have verified that Manziel <em>was</em> in Vegas this past weekend. </p>
<p>Many fans have called for the NFL to drug test Manziel immediately, but the league has yet to comment on the allegations against the Browns&#8217; much-hyped draft pick.</p>

<p>Last night, Justin had some unexpected help with the ruckus-causing:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the Biebs with Tyrese, Floyd Mayweather, and Johnny Football himself &#8211; Johnny Manziel.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="789" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-1024x789.jpg" alt="Justin &amp; Hailey at the Met Gala" class="wp-image-52883" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-1024x789.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-300x231.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-768x592.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-1536x1183.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-2048x1577.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-735x566.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-335x258.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-347x267.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-520x401.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-640x493.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-960x739.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/justin-and-hailey-at-the-met-gala-1080x832.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

          
<p>Cops responded to a late-night call from neighbors that the music in Justin&#8217;s unit was too loud. They spoke with someone in the residence and the tunes were turned down.</p>
<p>Just hours later, however, neighbors complained <em>again,</em> as a group of young Beliebers had gathered outside the apartment building and were shouting Justin&#8217;s name in unison.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Also at the party was Bieber&#8217;s ex, Chantel Jeffries &#8211; a model who&#8217;s rumored to be causing a <a href="/2014/07/justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez-breaking-up-because-of-chantel-je/">break up between Bieber and Gomez</a>.</p>
<p>Chantel&#8217;s attention was likely divided last night, as <a href="/2014/06/chantel-jeffries-clubbing-with-johnny-manziel/">Jeffries and Manziel went clubbing</a> in the past, and they&#8217;re rumored to have hooked up.</p>
<p>So yeah, Manziel has yet to take a snap in the NFL and he&#8217;s already making headlines for partying with Bieber and banging models. Good luck, Cleveland!</p>

<p>The Cleveland Browns first round draft pick and former Heisman Trophy winner was spotted partying in Houston over the weekend with Chantel Jeffries, the same Chantel Jeffries who was seated alongside <a href="/stars/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> when the singer was pulled over for drunk driving in January.</p>
<p>And who was then linked romantically to the singer for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Jeffries has also dated Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>If she&#8217;s now receiving curl patterns (YEAH!) or button hooks (OOOHHH YEAH!) from Johnny Manziel, this has to be considered an upgrade over Bieber.</p>
<p>Both he and Justin show a commitment to partying and to trolling their haters, but Manziel&#8217;s career is just getting started.</p>
<p>Bieber, conversely, seemed intent on destroying whatever good will he&#8217;s built up over the years by acting like a general jackass. He&#8217;s also back together with <a href="/stars/selena-gomez/">Selena Gomez</a>.</p>
<p>You never really had his heart, Chantel. You made the right choice.</p>

<p>That photo was posted to Instagram in the hours after Manziel was drafted by the Cleveland Browns as the 22nd overall pick in the draft.</p>
<p>Joined by 12th overall pick Odell Beckham, Jr., the rapper and controversial QB reportedly partied the night away, popping bottles of Ace of Spades champagne into the wee hours.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that he recently turned 21, Beckham reportedly passed on the bubbly. </p>

</div>
<p>Now that <a href="/2014/04/drake-disses-jay-z-lint-rolls-pants-at-raptors-game/">Drake is done lint rolling his pants</a> at Toronto Raptors games (his team was eliminated from this year&#8217;s playoffs in the first round), we&#8217;re happy he&#8217;s found a way to continue to force his way into the sports world, but we&#8217;re hoping he won&#8217;t be a bad influence on Johnny, who&#8217;s already made headlines for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>Manziel was investigated for selling autographs last year and reports of bad behavior and worse attitude problems marred the Heisman winner&#8217;s time at Texas A &amp; M.</p>
<p>Of course, Drake and Johnny could&#8217;ve engaged in a drunken, bare-knuckle boxing match and they still wouldn&#8217;t have been the biggest newsmakers of the weekend.</p>
<p>That title belongs to <a href="/2014/05/vito-cammisano-identified-as-michael-sam-boyfriend-see-them-kiss/">Michael Sam, the first openly gay player</a> to be drafted by the NFL. Sadly, Sam stayed home and celebrated with family instead of hitting the town with Champagne Papi. </p>

<p>And this one may take away his eligibility for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>An autograph broker on eBay spoke to ESPN&#8217;s Joe Schad on the condition of anonymity and said Maziel&#8217;s personal assistant approached him last season to let him know the quarterback now <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9539990/broker-says-johnny-manziel-friend-halted-free-autograph-signings">required compensation</a> in exchange for his signature.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/johnny-manziel-autograph-signing-controversy"></a></figure>
<p>This broker&#8217;s account follows a report by Outside the Lines yesterday which states the NCAA is looking into whether Manziel was paid for signing numerous items in January, with sources claiming he received a five-figure flat fee during his trip to Miami for the BCS title game.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>According to NCAA Bylaw 12.5.2.1, accepting money for promoting or advertising the commercial sale of a product or service makes one ineligible to play college football.</p>
<p>Texas A&amp;M Head Coach Kevin Sumlin told reporters that that &quot;our university is doing its due diligence to find out the facts&quot; regarding the latest Manziel scandal.</p>
<p>Over the last couple months, <a href="/2013/07/johnny-manziel-kicked-out-of-texas-frat-party/">Manziel was kicked out</a> of a Texas fraternity party and possibly posed with a <a href="/2013/04/johnny-manziel-heisman-photo-real-or-fake-blunt/">blunt-holding Heisman Trophy</a>.</p>
