<p>Tyra Banks was smizing left and right at the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show.</p>



<p>Officially, Tyra retired from modeling decades ago. But that didn&#8217;t stop her from strutting down the 2024 runway.</p>



<p>Tuesday night&#8217;s catwalk was a comeback for the VSFS and for Tyra &#8212; not to mention countless other big-name models.</p>



<p>From the music lineup to the cast of models, the show was a hit. But everyone&#8217;s talking about Tyra.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-somehow-tyra-banks-has-returned">Somehow, Tyra Banks has returned</h2>



<p>In another world, Tyra Banks would be kidnapping the mayor of Gotham and leaving over-the-top taunts for Batman to follow. Alas, in our world, her brand of supervillain camp is reserved for reality television, talk shows, and the runway.</p>



<p>When Tyra <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/10/why-did-dancing-with-the-stars-replace-tom-bergeron-and-erin-and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews</a> on <em>DWTS</em>, it didn&#8217;t work so well on a show whose median viewing audience is <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/why-dancing-with-the-stars-left-abc-disney-plus-1234715775/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 63</a>. But she was a <em>perfect </em>fit for this year&#8217;s Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show.</p>



<p>Nearly two months ahead of the event itself, Victoria&#8217;s Secret shared the news on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_NrMecv8_J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> with a skit.</p>

<p>The Victoria&#8217;s Secret video featured <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/gigi-hadid-targeted-by-israel-for-very-mild-pro-palestinian-take/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gigi Hadid</a> and Tyra Banks, with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-is-chappell-roan-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chappell Roan&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Feminomenon&#8221; playing at the end. That teaser came out in August.</p>



<p>The actual Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show went down on Tuesday, October 15.</p>



<p>There, Tyra Banks strutted down the catwalk. She&#8217;s a modeling veteran, having already walked nine VSFS runways before her 2005 retirement from modeling. Now, she&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>Tyra banks has been an icon of the fashion and modeling world for many years.</p>



<p>Though many remember <em>America&#8217;s Next Top Model</em> more for the flagrant cruelty and meme-worthy moments, Tyra has left an indelible mark upon the culture.</p>



<p>It absolutely makes sense for the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show to include Tyra alongside other famous faces for the 2024 return.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-2024-comeback-follows-a-6-year-hiatus">The 2024 comeback follows a 6-year hiatus</h2>



<p>From 1995 until 2018, the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show was a staple of the modeling world. Then, the company pressed pause on what was once a primetime event.</p>



<p>There were murmurs that blame lay with #MeToo or body positivity or inclusiveness of trans models, even though the idea of canceling an event rather than including people is not a great look. Truth be told, the scandals of Ed Razek&#8217;s bigoted comments and Les Wexner&#8217;s association with Jeffrey Epstein <em>may </em>have been contributing factors.</p>



<p>Now, the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show is back with a vengeance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>After 15 years of <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>, ABC decided on a change.</p>



<p>Instead of making more <em>tasteful </em>casting choices, the show <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/tom-bergeron-hurls-shade-at-fired-dancing-with-the-stars-produce/">ousted Tom Bergeron</a> and Erin Andrews.</p>



<p>After that controversial move, the show cast actress, model, and supervillain Tyra Banks as host.</p>



<p>Now, <em>DWTS </em>is giving her a co-host &#8230; and while he&#8217;s a familiar face to the show, it&#8217;s not Tom or Erin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Alfonso Ribeiro is of course most famous for his role on <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>.</p>



<p>He is also a <em>Dancing With The Stars</em> alum, having taken home the mirror ball trophy in 2014.</p>



<p>This week, ABC revealed that he will join Tyra Banks as a cohost for the show&#8217;s 31st season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super excited,&#8221; Alfonso gushed <a href="https://people.com/tv/alfonso-ribiero-joins-tyra-banks-as-cohost-dancing-with-the-stars-season-31/">to <em>People</em></a><em> </em>this week.</p>



<p>&#8220;For me to be asked now to co-host with Tyra,&#8221; he remarked.</p>



<p>Alfonso continued: &#8220;and be part of the great crew and dancers and friends.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;To be able to be on stage with them and to be part of that family again,&#8221; Alfonso continued.</p>



<p>This is something that &#8220;is quite special for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alfonso pointed out: &#8220;I mean, these dancers are friends of mine at this point now.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;We really do all hang out together,&#8221; Alfonso noted, &#8220;and talk outside of that show.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My goal is to bring back a sense of the happy and the fun,&#8221; he expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Alfonso continued, &#8220;the family atmosphere.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/0715-Alfonso-Ribeiro-DWTS-Announcement.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Alfonso detailed that this is the vibe &#8220;that this show has always felt like for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to become friends with all of the contestants this year,&#8221; he expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Alfonso then continued, he wants to &#8220;allow myself to kind of be able to really just sit and talk with them.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Alfonso then aspired: &#8220;And after their dance, I want to get honest, and true feelings from them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he continued, he wants to &#8220;make people laugh and make people smile again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like sometimes it gets a little serious,&#8221; Alfonso observed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;And while it needs to be that also,&#8221; Alfonso then admitted. </p>



<p>He opined that &#8220;it also needs to be light and fun and cheery.&#8221;</p>



<p>That certainly sounds like the appropriate tone for the show.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Alfonso Ribeiro and Witney Carson are hoisted into the air following their Season 19 victory. Everyone&#8230; do the Carlton!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some viewers have been critical of the show and its host since Tyra took the reins.</p>



<p>Taking issue with the ousting of Tom and Erin is extremely valid.</p>



<p>But some have just not enjoyed Tyra&#8217;s energy. To be fair, she is a larger-than-life personality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t mean to lump a large group of people together, but it&#8217;s mostly older viewers who feel this way.</p>



<p>Many younger viewers like the raw, chaotic energy that Tyra brings to &#8230; everything that she does in life.</p>



<p>Of course, given the viewing demographics of <em>DWTS </em>(<em>some </em>young people do watch, we swear!), perhaps the show needed balance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s likely that producers hope that Alfonso can bring that counterpoint to Tyra&#8217;s energy.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Season 31 will debut on Disney Plus some time this fall &#8212; but we do not yet know the date.</p>



<p>And yes, the show has already been renewed for Season 32.</p>

<p>Season 29 being hosted by Tyra Banks was a huge shift.</p>
<p>Fans were shocked. The former hosts, Erin and Tom, were shocked too.</p>
<p>Apparently, ABC felt that the dance competition needed a change.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Executive producer Andrew Llinares explained the move at ABC&#8217;s VirtuFall panel on Wednesday, September 30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s all about evolution,&quot; he expressed.</p>
<p>Llinares opined: &quot;I think any show like this that has been on many, many seasons needs to continue to evolve.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;I think changing the host was all about evolution,&quot; Llinares continued on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was about making the show feel fresh,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>Llinares added: &quot;making it feel new.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Llinares admitted that there was a home that the shake-up would &quot;kind of make it reach out &mdash; maybe to a new audience as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As well,&quot; he concluded, &quot;as the audience that&rsquo;s been there for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some shows hope to snare an audience, get them hooked on the format, and then make unnecessary changes to attract new viewers.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>More has changed than just the casting.</p>
<p>The dance competition is now working with one host instead of two.</p>
<p>That creates a very different dynamic.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-683x1024.jpg" alt="Tyra Banks at the BMAs" class="wp-image-298409" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-at-the-bmas-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s working brilliantly with the one host,&quot; Llinares suggested.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I think it&rsquo;s really refreshed the pace of the show, actually.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s taken it to a new pace,&quot; Llinares told reporters, &quot;in terms of moving faster and just feeling different.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I think there&rsquo;s a real danger when a show&rsquo;s been on for a long time,&quot; Llinares claimed, &quot;that the audience almost gets bored of the rhythm.&quot;</p>
<p>He clarified: &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just sort of gets a little boring,&quot; Llinares added, &quot;the rhythm of it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; Linares stated, &quot;I think it&rsquo;s changed the rhythm of the show in a really exciting way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tyra is doing an amazing, amazing job,&quot; he praised.</p>
<p>It is true that Tyra is an eye-catching personality. One of our world&#8217;s greatest, most treasured supervillains.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Llinares expressed: &quot;It&rsquo;s just so wonderful to have her energy in the ballroom and her expertise as a host in the ballroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I think she&rsquo;s brought a new life to everything,&quot; he opined.</p>
<p>Llinares concluded his statements to reporters: &quot;It&rsquo;s really exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>If it sounds like he was just stringing words together in what sounded like an explanation, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that he&#8217;s lying to cover up a &quot;real&quot; explanation.</p>
<p>Sure, that&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;s every bit as possible that Llinares and others at the network genuinely think this way.</p>
<p>It has been said that the people who make television on the network side of things &#8212; the ones who worry about focus groups and mess with apparent perfection &#8212; are among the dumbest folks on earth.</p>

<p>Tyra has a captivating and outrageous personality, one that has made her legendary well beyond her career.</p>
<p>It does make sense to employ her as a host.</p>
<p>Whether she will draw in a new audience to get songs that they don&#8217;t like stuck in their heads so that they can watch a random hodge-podge of moderately famous people dance &#8230; only time will tell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in July, we learned that <a href="/2020/07/tyra-banks-to-takeover-as-host-of-dancing-with-the-stars/">Tyra Banks would be taking over as host</a> of <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>.</p>
<p>Now, we know the contestants for this season &#8230; and this list is so nuts, it&#8217;ll slather you with sardine oil and feed you to tigers.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As you can see in this teaser that we&#8217;ve included, the list of contenstants for Season 29 includes Carole Baskin.</p>
<p>The infamous Tiger King star is a polarizing figure. Some think that she murdered her husband. Others think that she was portrayed unfairly.</p>
<p>But while she is the most eye-popping choice on the cast list, she is not the only upcoming contestant.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Chrishell Stause has been an actress for years.</p>
<p>But this summer, she made headlines as her divorce from Justin Hartley&#8217;s details were spilled on Netflix&#8217;s <em>Selling Sunset</em>.</p>
<p>Is her joining this show <a href="/2020/08/chrishell-stause-teases-selling-sunset-renewal-for-season-4-amid/">the mysterious good news that Chrishell celebrated</a> in August?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Skai Jackson is a young, talented, and brilliant actress.</p>
<p>Also an author and a YouTuber, she was listed as one of <em>Time</em>&#8216;s Most Influential Teens in 2016.</p>
<p>Still a teenager, this impressive talent is going to keep other contestants on their toes.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Beloved Olympic figureskater Johnny Weir is no stranger to <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>.</p>
<p>But even one of the greatest performers in the world can falter, so nothing is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Johnny will be one to watch for sure.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Justina Machado is a talented actress, best known for her starring role on<em> One Day At A Time</em>.</p>
<p>The beloved Netflix series was canceled due to Netflix&#8217;s bizarre business model, but saved by CBS-owned Pop TV.</p>
<p>Justina will be competing not just for herself, but to remind viewers that her brilliant and heartful show is still alive and kicking.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Kaitlyn Bristowe is a familair name and face to most, as she is a well known part of the Bachelor Nation.</p>
<p>Not only was she a contestant on the 19th season of <em>The Bachelor</em>, she was the titular lead on the 11th season of <em>The Bachelorette</em>.</p>
<p>Let us hope that she has more luck on the dance floor than she has in her love life!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Nev Schulman is best known as the host of <em>Catfish </em>on MTV.</p>
<p>However, he was accused in a #MeToo statement &#8230; and &quot;cleared&quot; by MTV even though investigators never spoke to his accuser.</p>
<p>This makes him an odd choice, though one could arguably say that Carole Baskin&#8217;s casting and Sean Spicer&#8217;s legacy means that the show is an amoral free-for-all.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Charles Oakley is a former professional basketball player.</p>
<p>Research tells us that he was consistently ranked as one of the best rebounders in the NBA.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t claim to know much about sports, but we all know that on-the-court athletic skill does not always translate to talent on the dance floor.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jeannie Mai is a television host and stylist.</p>
<p>Obviously, she is best known for the <em>How Do I Look?</em> makeover show and for <em>The Real</em>.</p>
<p>We all know that there is more to dancing than style &#8230; but it doesn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jesse Metcalfe has been a hearththrob for a solid decade and a half.</p>
<p>To this day, he is still best known for his role on <em>Desperate Housewives</em>, but is also known for <em>Passions</em> and <em>John Tucker Must Die</em>.</p>
<p>This 41-year-old hunk is going to have thirsty fans waxing nostalgic &#8230; but will that make the difference?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Monica Aldama is a cheerleading coach, which may make her very well suited to some of the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>She is the head coach on Netflix&#8217;s <em>Cheer</em>.</p>
<p>Is it just us, or are there an awful lot of Netflix stars in this particular season? Maybe producers binged too much in quarantine.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Nelly is an American rapper, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr.</p>
<p>He is also known for his business ventures and his acting.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether his investment in reality TV dancing pays dividends.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Anne Heche is an actress, director, and screenwriter.</p>
<p>While we look forward to seeing her dance, she is a little topical-by-proxy at the moment.</p>
<p>Her ex is Ellen DeGeneres. The two split a full two decades ago, but with <a href="/videos/mariah-carey-recalls-cruel-interview-with-ellen-degeneres-where/">Ellen making headlines in the worst ways</a> these days, it&#8217;s bound to be on everyone&#8217;s minds.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>AJ McLean needs little to no introduction for my fellow Millennials, as he was and is one of the <em>Backstreet Boys</em>.</p>
<p>This legendary performer is no stranger to dancing, choreography, or having an audience.</p>
<p>It will be a treat to see if he&#8217;s &quot;still got it&quot; when it comes to wooing an audience through the camera.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And of course the host, the smizing supervillain herself, Tyra Banks.</p>
<p>It will be a bit of a culture shift to see her as host, but one thing about Tyra is that she is always entertaining.</p>
<p>The new season premieres in less than two weeks &#8212; on Monday, September 14 at 8pm on ABC. That is so soon!</p>

<p>Erin Andrews is out.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;Tyra Banks is now officially in.</p>

<p>The day after ABC confirmed&nbsp;<a href="/2020/07/tom-bergeron-and-erin-andrews-both-fired-by-dancing-with-the-sta/">Bergeron and Andrews had both been fired</a> from their roles on Dancing with the Stars, the network has&nbsp; confirmed that Banks will takeover the former&#8217;s spot.</p>
<p>Tyra will also serve as an executive producer of the series.</p>
<p>One of the better-known models in American history, Banks is best known to reality television viewers for having also hosted and produced America&#8217;s Next Top Model for many years.</p>

<p>Said Banks in a statement:</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve been a fan of &#8216;DWTS&#8217; since its beginning &#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;The fun mixed with raw emotion, seeing celebrities push past their comfort zones, the sizzling dance performances &#8230; it&rsquo;s always transported me to my days of turning it up 10 notches on the catwalk.</p>
<p>&quot;Tom has set a powerful stage, and I&rsquo;m excited to continue the legacy and put on my executive producer and hosting hats.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="707" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-707x1024.jpg" alt="Tyra Banks at 2018 AMAs" class="wp-image-311079" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-707x1024.jpg 707w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-768x1113.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-1060x1536.jpg 1060w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-1414x2048.jpg 1414w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-735x1065.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-231x335.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-240x347.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-359x520.jpg 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-442x640.jpg 442w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-530x768.jpg 530w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-663x960.jpg 663w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-745x1080.jpg 745w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/tyra-banks-at-2018-amas-scaled.jpg 1767w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Karey Burke, president of ABC Entertainment, also chimed in on this change as follows:</p>
<p><em>Tom has been an integral part of the ABC family for nearly two decades, from hosting &lsquo;AFV&rsquo; to &lsquo;Dancing with the Stars&rsquo; &ndash; we are grateful for all he and Erin have done to make &lsquo;Dancing&rsquo; a success.</em></p>
<p><em>As we gear up for the show&rsquo;s 29th season, we can&rsquo;t wait to welcome Tyra Banks to our &lsquo;Dancing&rsquo; stage. </em></p>
<p><em>Tyra is an award-winning multihyphenate whose fierce female prowess and influence across many industries have made an indelible mark</em></p>
<p><em>Her fresh take on America&rsquo;s favorite dancing competition will surely bring more than a &lsquo;Smize&rsquo; to fans everywhere.</em></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Bergeron had anchored the reality dance competition alongside a variety of co-hosts since its premiere in 2005.</p>
<p>Andrews joined Bergeron as a co-host in 2014.</p>
<p>In a somewhat awkward development, Bergeron was the one to tell the public that he was being replaced.</p>

<p>&quot;Just informed @DancingABC will be continuing without me,&quot; he Tweeted.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been an incredible 15 year run and the most unexpected gift of my career.&nbsp; I&#8217;m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;That said, now what am I supposed to do with all of these glitter masks?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Andrews later jumped in with a Tweet that read:</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you ABC and the entire Dancing with the Stars family for 6 memorable seasons. Those years wouldn&#8217;t have been as special without my loving host Tom Bergeron, the talented dancers, and witty judges.</p>
<p>&quot;I will always cherish my days on set, even if I wasn&#8217;t the best at walking in heels.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>ABC and BBC Studios finally announced Bergeron and Andrews&#8217; departures from the show themselves on Monday, saying in a joint statement:</p>
<p>&quot;Tom Bergeron will forever be part of the Dancing with the Stars family.</p>
<p>&quot;As we embark on a new creative direction, he departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Was Bergeron let go due to some of his <a href="/2019/08/tom-bergeron-cant-believe-sean-spicer-is-on-dancing-with-the-sta/">critical statements against the show</a>?</p>
<p>Or is the network just looking to diversify?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll likely never have the ful answer.</p>
<p>But here is how&nbsp;General Manager of BBC Studios&#8217; LA Productions Valerie Bruce summed up the switch&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><strong><em>Tyra Banks is an icon whose powerful presence, trademark confidence, and industry-leading achievements inspire us.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We are proud to partner with ABC to welcome her as the new host of Dancing with the Stars.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This represents a landmark moment in our 28 seasons producing Dancing with the Stars as we take this iconic show in a new creative direction. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We offer our sincere thanks to Tom and Erin, whom we will always consider part of the Dancing with the Stars family.</em></strong></p>

<p>Even though she&nbsp;<a href="/2016/02/tyra-banks-baby-photo-hes-perfect/">blessed Instagram with a picture of her son, York&#8217;s head in February</a>&nbsp;2016, she apparently wanted to keep her little bundle of joy under wraps for a bit&nbsp;longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one can blame her. Not everyone wants their family paraded in front of the cameras.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That all changed on Father&#8217;s day when the America&#8217;s Got Talent host took to Instagram&nbsp;to show a picture of her son of to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To all the amazing daddies out there that love their kids unconditionally like my mommy&#8217;s daddy and my daddy, too &#8230; HAPPY FATHER&#8217;S DAY! -York?,&rdquo; the supermodel shared.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Erik also shared the picture Tyra posted. The photographer has four other kids from a previous relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tyra confirmed the baby news in late 2016 in a sweet Instagram post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best present we worked and prayed so hard for is finally here. He&#8217;s got my fingers and big eyes and his daddy Erik&#8217;s mouth and chin,&rdquo; she shared.</p>

<p>Tyra met Erik while working on America&#8217;s Next Top Model three years ago and the couple has been going strong since.</p>
