<p>Jinger Duggar is clapping back at fans who are &#8220;demanding&#8221; to see her children.</p>



<p>Especially after some took to baiting her with twisted rumors.</p>



<p>Less than a week after Jinger and Jeremy <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jinger-duggar-welcomes-baby-3-find-out-his-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">welcomed their third child</a>, entitled weirdos flooded her comments.</p>



<p>In what appears to be an effort to troll Jinger into answering, some even ask if she is <em>hiding</em> a &#8220;disabled&#8221; child. Enough is enough.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-1024x576.png" alt="Jinger Duggar, Jeremy Vuolo, and newborn Finnegan." class="wp-image-522808" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_jingerduggar_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">At the end of March 2025, Jinger Duggar and Jeremy Vuolo appear with their newborn, Finnegan. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-trolls-get-fresh-with-jinger-duggar">Some trolls get fresh with Jinger Duggar</h2>



<p>On Thursday, April 3, Jinger Duggar fielded questions from random followers for an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jingervuolo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story Q&amp;A.</p>



<p>One questioner demanded for Jinger to &#8220;show us your girls.&#8221;</p>



<p>That same person then asked: &#8220;Is one disabled in some way?&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-1024x576.png" alt="Jinger Duggar speaks into the podcast mic on her podcast in December 2024." class="wp-image-515613" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_jingerduggar_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the podcast that she shares with her husband, a very pregnant Jinger Duggar shares a scary family moment in December 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I’ve never answered this question,&#8221; Jinger began her answer. &#8220;But sadly it’s been a rumor for years.&#8221;</p>



<p>She emphasized: &#8220;This is actually why we don’t show our children’s faces and choose to give them privacy.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is fairly consistent with past statements, such as in late 2023, when Jinger previously addressed avoiding showcasing her children on social media.</p>

<p>“1) People demand to see them,&#8221; Jinger then listed.</p>



<p>&#8220;2) We don’t want to subject our kids to how cruel some people can be in their judgments,&#8221; she reasoned.</p>



<p>Jinger commented: &#8220;It’s honestly just sad to see these comments come in.”</p>

<p>“We have been blessed with three healthy children,&#8221; Jinger then confirmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;But even if God had chosen to give us a child with a medical condition, that would in NO WAY change the way we share them on socials,” she strongly emphasized.</p>



<p>Jinger, who is a Christian, then expressed the belief: “Every life is precious and a gift from God.”</p>

<p>On March 29, Jinger Duggar gave birth to her third child, Finnegan Charles Vuolo.</p>



<p>She and Jeremy are already parents to daughters Felicity, who is 6, and Evangeline, who is 4.</p>



<p>Jinger characterized the delivery as &#8220;pretty great&#8221; and shared that she was pretty sure that Jeremy had come up with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jinger-joy-anna-duggar-same-nickname/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the baby name</a>.</p>

<p>Jinger Duggar is a mother once again.</p>



<p>On Sunday, the 19 Kids and Counting alum welcomed her third baby with husband Jeremy Vuolo. </p>



<p>As previously spoiled by the former reality star, we already knew the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jinger-duggar-reveals-gender-of-impending-third-child/">child would be a boy</a>. But now we can confirm the newborn&#8217;s name&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="621" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/rs_981x1024-241025055303-429662554_18331848769117195_3488732026672811817_n-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522450" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/rs_981x1024-241025055303-429662554_18331848769117195_3488732026672811817_n-copy.jpg 702w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/rs_981x1024-241025055303-429662554_18331848769117195_3488732026672811817_n-copy-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jinger Duggar shared this photo of her and her husband on social media.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re so glad you&#8217;re here, <strong>Finnegan Charles Vuolo</strong>!</p>



<p>&#8220;Baby&#8217;s doing great. I&#8217;m feeling exhausted but otherwise, it was a pretty fairly great delivery,&#8221; Jinger said in a YouTube video shared on March 30, which features her sitting beside her spouse at their home as he holds their son.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just so thankful to God that we have this healthy baby boy here with us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finnegan weighed 8 pounds and one ounce at birth and and measured 21 inches in length; he joins sister Felicity, 6 and sister Evangeline, 4, as part of this immediate family.</p>

<p>The couple, who got married in 2016, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jinger-duggar-pregnant-with-baby-3/">announced in October that they were expecting</a> their third child.</p>



<p>“We’re super excited,” Duggar told People Magazine at the time.</p>



<p>Vuolo, for his part, revealed that the pregnancy “was something we were expecting,” although he was still “literally speechless” when his wife shared the blessed news with him. </p>



<p>As is their style, and as they did here upon the birth taking place, the spouses documented the special moment in a YouTube video five months ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the most special moments for us was when the girls got to come to the hospital and meet this little guy,&#8221; Jeremy said on Sunday. &#8220;And my family as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>As cited above, Finnegan is the couple&#8217;s first son.</p>



<p>“When she told me, I was literally speechless,” Jeremy added to People about his wife in their October interview.</p>



<p>“She got me good. It was on Felicity&#8217;s birthday. Jinger says, ‘I&#8217;ve got a gift for you.’ It was in an Amazon bag. So I&#8217;m thinking, &#8216;What did she get from Amazon for me?&#8217; Then I open it up and it&#8217;s the positive result, and I&#8217;m actually speechless.”</p>



<p>Jinger is the sixth child of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. </p>



<p>She starred alongside her family members on the TLC reality shows 19 Kids and Counting from 2008 to 2015 and Counting On from 2015 to 2021&#8230; both of which were canceled due to massive scandals involving <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/josh-duggar/">Josh Duggar</a>.</p>



<p><em>Congratulations to the happy, expanded family!</em></p>

<p>Do Jinger and Joy-Anna Duggar have a mini-feud over their daughters&#8217; names?</p>



<p>No. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that there hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;some drama&#8221; by their own admission.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jinger-duggar-joy-anna-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duggar sisters</a> have daughters with different names, yet with the same nickname.</p>



<p>Who copied whom? How did the sisters respond when they first found out?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-duggar-sisters-jinger-and-joy-anna-each-have-their-own-evy">Duggar sisters Jinger and Joy-Anna each have their own &#8216;Evy&#8217;</h2>



<p>On last week&#8217;s episode of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0cNtHd1fBY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jinger &amp; Jeremy Podcast</a></em>, the titular Jinger and Jeremy spoke with Jinger&#8217;s sister, Joy-Anna Duggar, who sat in as their guest.</p>



<p>Joy-Anna and her husband, Austin Forsyth, have a daughter named Evelyn. They welcomed her in August of 2020.</p>



<p>Almost exactly three months later, Jinger and Jeremy welcomed their own &#8220;Evy,&#8221; Evangeline. There are two preschool-aged girls nicknamed &#8220;Evy&#8221; in the family.</p>

<p>“There is some drama, with the name, well it’s not really drama … but it was a funny incident with Evy when you named Evelyn … tell that story,” Jeremy Vuolo admitted while sitting in the room with both Jinger and Joy-Anna Duggar.</p>



<p>“We’ve had two people in the last week be like, ‘Oh there’s two Evys!’&#8221; Joy-Anna chimed in. </p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;Because especially when we get when we’re together we get asked.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-according-to-jinger-duggar-it-started-with-joy-anna-keeping-a-secret">According to Jinger Duggar, it started with Joy-Anna keeping a secret</h2>



<p>“Y’all kept your Evy, her name was a secret until she was born, and she was born about six months before our Evy,&#8221; Jinger Duggar told Joy-Anna.</p>



<p>Just to clarify, Evelyn was born on August 21. Evangeline was born on November 22 of the same year. We don&#8217;t fault Jinger for her overestimation, especially knowing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/10/jason-duggar-totally-failed-by-cult-approved-homeschool-educatio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what kind of education</a> these poor girls received.</p>



<p>&#8220;When she was born you sent a video to the family,&#8221; Jinger recalled. &#8220;And you said, ‘First, we’re going to tell you the nickname name. It’s Evy.&#8217;”</p>

<p>“When you sent that video, I’ll never forget, we look at each other, like ‘Oh my goodness,&#8217;” Jeremy recalled.</p>



<p>What followed was a phone call between the sisters and their respective husbands, as Jinger and Joy-Anna discussed the overlapping nicknames.</p>



<p>“We did not care at all,&#8221; Joy-Anna emphasized. &#8220;But I do remember y’all calling me and I was like, ‘That’s so great. It’s going to be confusing, but it’s going to be awesome.'&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-could-be-a-new-baby-any-day-now">There could be a new baby any day now</h2>



<p>Jinger Duggar is pregnant. She and her husband, Jeremy Vuolo, already share two children. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jinger-duggar-reveals-gender-of-impending-third-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baby #3&#8217;s</a> due date is in March of 2025.</p>



<p>Hopefully, there will be no accidental nickname overlap with any of this child&#8217;s cousins.</p>



<p>That said, in a family whose cult famously promotes procreation over all else, Jinger has so many little nieces and nephews. It would be <em>easy </em>to have nickname overlap.</p>

<p>Actually, to be more specific and intriguing, Jinger Duggar sat down for a VERY revealing interview.</p>



<p>Speaking on February 27 to the host of some podcast called “The Deep End With Lecrae,&#8221; Jinger delved further into her childhood &#8212; which we <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jinger-duggar-details-horrible-living-conditions-as-a-child-we-barely-had-any-food/">already know was a sad mess</a> &#8212; by stating for the first time one rule that we had never heard of before at least.</p>

<p>“We held to this teacher as a prophet sent from God,” Duggar admitted of Basic Life Principles leader Bill Gothard, whose religious teaching are followed by Jinger&#8217;s parents, Jim Bob and Michelle. </p>



<p>She then explained a couple of the ways in which her mom and dad put their foot down with their kids:</p>



<p>“The girls wear skirts only, not listen to any music with drums, if you turn on music with drums, you’re calling demons.”</p>



<p>There it is. We&#8217;ve never heard of that one. We were unaware that Duggar children weren&#8217;t permitted to turn on music with drums because they were considered a means of calling the Devil.</p>

<p>The no-pants-for-women thing most observers are well aware of.</p>



<p>For her part, meanwhile, Jinger has insisted that she still loves her parents&#8230; but that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jinger-duggar-opens-up-about-differences-with-parents-i-still-love-them/">traumatized by the ways</a> in which she was raised.</p>



<p>During this same appearance, Duggar also cited her brother Josh, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/josh-duggar-sentenced-12-and-a-half-years-in-federal-prison/">is serving a dozen years in prison</a> after being convicted on charges of child pornography possession.</p>



<p>“You kind of step back and say, ‘Okay what things do matter?’ It was not until later on when we were walking through a lot of difficulties publicly, one of my brothers made decisions that were very bad and that landed him in prison,” Jinger recounted of her older sibling. </p>



<p>“In that time, I realized people are looking at this as Christianity, but this is not what the gospel is about. Somebody needs to speak up.”</p>

<p>That&#8217;s for sure. Downloading numerous explicit photos and videos of minors is definitely NOT what Christianity is about.</p>



<p>Jinger almost never makes comments about Josh, who has been behind bars since his April 2021 arrest on the aforementioned charges.</p>



<p>“Duggar allegedly possessed this material, some of which depicts the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, in May 2019,” according to a press release shared by the United States Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Arkansas back then.</p>

<p>Jinger previously released a memoir that exposed a lot about her upbringing and said on one occasion that she was forced to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jinger-duggar-tlc-forced-me-to-fake-my-relationship/">fake moments from her relationship</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would say that there’s probably not an adequate word for describing the unique kind of awkward it is to go through that whole process with cameras shoved in your faces and someone interrupting you when the conversation is just starting to flow,&#8221; Duggar wrote, adding of now-husband Jeremy:</p>



<p>“He asked me to be his girlfriend, the sweetest moment. And then we got to do it all over again because there was a mic issue. And then we had to do some more takes. And then we had to do cutaways.”</p>



<p>Jinger made her small screen debut with her family in a 2004 documentary about their daily lives.</p>



<p>Four years later, 19 Kids and Counting premiered on TLC and aired until its 2015 cancellation.</p>



<p>A spinoff titled Counting On, which focused on Jinger and her sisters Jill and Jessa Duggar, kicked off later that year and was pulled off the air in 2021.<br></p>

<p>In what may be the least surprising non-bombshell to ever sort of explode on the celebrity gossip scene, Jinger Duggar said recently that it was challenging growing up in a household with 18 other siblings.</p>



<p>On an episode of &#8220;The Jinger &amp; Jeremy Podcast,&#8221; the sixth Duggar child explained to her co-host (and husband) some of the ways in which it sucked to be a daughter of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar&#8230;</p>

<p>For one thing, the family couldn&#8217;t afford its current 7,000-square foot home back in the day.</p>



<p>As a result, they resided in small rental homes where the children and their parents shared just two bathrooms, which led to long lines &#8212; <strong>and cold showers</strong>.</p>



<p>“I think when we were younger that was more of a problem because we only had two bathrooms in most of our rental homes,” Jinger said on the podcast. </p>



<p>“There was constantly a line and the water would not stay hot very long, so if you wanted to have a hot shower, you needed to be one of the first two or three in there.”</p>

<p>Jinger, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/jinger-duggar-lying-to-protect-her-family-in-new-memoir/">tore her family apart in her 2023 memoir</a>, also said she and her brothers and sisters were pretty darn hungry when they were small.</p>



<p>“I remember a few times when we were very young some of my siblings would take their food, take their plate of food &#8212; get ready for this, it’s disgusting &#8212; in the bathroom, they would carry it and put it on the bathroom counter, my mom would be like, ‘Don’t do that,’ they’re like, ‘They’re going to eat it,’” Jinger recalled.</p>



<p>“That’s literally what they thought, ‘I’m not going to be able to eat my food because somebody’s going to take it and we might not have enough for seconds today.’”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jinger-duggar-new-book-details/">Jinger came out with another book</a> last month.</p>



<p>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t contain many scathing revelations like the ones she used to hurl her parents under a bus during this podcast.</p>



<p>Continuing on this sad meal theme, Jinger said some of the family’s dinners <strong>were eaten directly out of a can</strong>.</p>



<p>“We’d always try to get whatever we could at Aldi because it was cheap, we would get flats of cans of ravioli and of green beans, corn, we would eat them out of the can,” she said. </p>



<p>“So ravioli, we would eat it cold, and that was our meal a lot of days, and then we would eat green beans out of the can and we’d pour salt and vinegar in there, in a can, and just eat it, and that was our favorite.”</p>

<p>On the fashion front?</p>



<p>Jinger and her sister did the best they could any time the siblings went out in public.</p>



<p>“Jessa and I would usually pack all of the kids’ clothes, sometimes even like the older teenage boys would be like, ‘Oh, I don’t care, just get me clothes that are nice,’ so we would do the shopping for them a lot of times, we would pack the clothes,” Jinger told listeners. </p>



<p>“Back in the day we were all about color-coordinating everybody, so we would not match, we hated matching, but my parents were like, ‘We want you to kind of coordinate at least,’ so we would pick out the outfits so that way they would be somewhat stylish.</p>



<p>&#8220;So we would look at the Brooks Brothers catalogs, we would be like, ‘Okay, what should we get the kids?’ and we could not afford it so we would go to the thrift store and we’d buy whatever we could find that looked similar to that.”</p>

<p>As previously cited, Jinger has written two books.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t seem especially close to her mom and dad, but has said in the past <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jinger-duggar-opens-up-about-differences-with-parents-i-still-love-them/">that she still loves them</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone out there care to start a drumroll?</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Jinger Duggar and her husband Jeremy sat down for a special YouTube video in which the couple focused on the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jinger-duggar-pregnant-with-baby-3/">former&#8217;s third pregnancy</a>.</p>



<p>Specifically&#8230; whether Jinger and Jeremy are expecting a son or a daughter.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="758" height="427" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/hq720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517058" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/hq720.jpg 758w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/hq720-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/hq720-728x410.jpg 728w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jinger Duggar appears here on an episode of CBS This Morning.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (CBS/YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After opening up a package of miniature suspenders, the spouses cried out in the footage, <strong><em>It&#8217;s a boy!</em></strong></p>



<p>So there we have it, folks.</p>



<p>The reality stars already share daughters Felicity, 6, and Evangeline, 4, which helped to explain why Jeremy could scarcely even detail his enthusiasm for to add a son into the mix.</p>



<p>&#8220;You got a boy! Are you excited?&#8221; Jinger asked her husband, to which he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m speechless.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love it—a speechless Jeremy. That&#8217;s rare,&#8221; Jinger joked. &#8220;Crazy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jinger just released a new memoir and has been conducting a number of interviews in promotion of the book, which is titled People Pleaser: Breaking Free From the Burden of Imaginary Expectations.</p>



<p>In one excerpt, the 19 Kids and Counting Alum delves into one specific way in which she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jinger-duggar-tlc-forced-me-to-fake-my-relationship/">forced to fake various moments</a> from her life for the TLC cameras.</p>



<p>“Early days, first meals together, making small talk, the process of getting to know someone can feel a little awkward,” she writes.</p>



<p>“But I would say that there’s probably not an adequate word for describing the unique kind of awkward it is to go through that whole process with cameras shoved in your faces and someone interrupting you when the conversation is just starting to flow.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="908" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-1024x908.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512845" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-1024x908.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-300x266.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-768x681.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-2048x1815.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-960x851.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-1080x957.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1163853781-1200x1064.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jeremy Vuolo and Jinger Duggar Vuolo attend the Los Angeles Special Screening Of Discovery&#8217;s &#8220;Serengeti&#8221; at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on July 23, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jinger went on to reference filming with husband Jeremy Vuolo as “date-night-on-demand,” recalling how she was “instructed to repeat some of the same conversation and gestures” they’d made in a previous take.</p>



<p>Awkward, huh? And annoying AF.</p>



<p>Jinger and Jeremy do seem legitimately in love, however, and they said in this new video that they shared the gender news with Duggar&#8217;s extended family over the holiday season&#8230; but not before letting their oldest daughter in on the secret.</p>



<p>&#8220;We told her we&#8217;d tell her first because she did not want to find out with everybody,&#8221; Jinger told her siblings while gathered in front of the Christmas tree, as seen in the YouTube clip. </p>



<p>The couple never shows Felicity&#8217;s face, but we <em>do</em> hear her psyched response in the footage. It simply goes as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;BOY!&#8221;</p>

<p>The curtain is coming up on 19 Kids and Counting.</p>



<p>The reality show aired for seven seasons on TLC and was canceled after Josh Duggar admitted he had molested his siblings as a young teenager.</p>



<p>(This was before <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/josh-duggar-found-guilty-of-child-pornography-possession/">Josh Duggar was convicted</a> on child pornography charges. The guy has <em>serious</em> problems.)</p>

<p>Back to Jinger, though:</p>



<p>In her latest book, <em>People Pleaser: Breaking Free From the Burden of Imaginary Expectations</em>, the former cast member delves into one specific way in which she was forced to fake various moments from her life for the camera.</p>



<p>“Early days, first meals together, making small talk, the process of getting to know someone can feel a little awkward,&#8221; she writes. </p>



<p>&#8220;But I would say that there’s probably not an adequate word for describing the unique kind of awkward it is to go through that whole process with cameras shoved in your faces and someone interrupting you when the conversation is just starting to flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jinger went on to reference filming with husband Jeremy Vuolo as “date-night-on-demand,” recalling how she was “instructed to repeat some of the same conversation and gestures” they’d made in a previous take.</p>



<p>To be clear, Duggar explains, these moments happened organically &#8212; but what viewers saw on each episode? Well&#8230;</p>



<p>“Fast-forward a few months, and I found myself walking down the staircase in my house toward Jeremy, anticipating that we might be about to make our relationship official,&#8221; she writes, adding how a producer jumped in to ruin this special reveal.</p>



<p>&#8220;I took each stair carefully, smiling at Jer, butterflies in my stomach, excited to hear what he would say to me when I got to the bottom of the stairs.</p>



<p>&#8220;<strong><em>Cut! Jinger, go back up the stairs please! We need to start over to get the shot.</em></strong> OK.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jinger-duggar-celebrates-8th-wedding-anniversary-to-jeremy-vuolo-this-is-the-best-adventure/">Jinger and Jeremy have been married</a> for eight years and seem legitimately happy.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jinger-duggar-pregnant-with-baby-3/">expecting their third child</a>.</p>



<p>But the journey to get to this place was clearly unusual, filled with input from outsiders and spontaneous exchanges that had to be recreated for television.</p>



<p>“He asked me to be his girlfriend, the sweetest moment,” she adds. “And then we got to do it all over again because there was a mic issue. And then we had to do some more takes. And then we had to do cutaways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jinger made her small screen debut with her family in a 2004 documentary about their daily lives. </p>



<p>Four years later, 19 Kids and Counting premiered on TLC and aired until its 2015 cancellation. </p>



<p>A spinoff titled Counting On, which focused on Jinger and her sisters Jill and Jessa Duggar, kicked off later that year and was canceled in 2021.</p>



<p>According to Duggar, meeting Jeremy in 2015 was like a breath of fresh air, “but it was also kind of terrifying,” she says in the book, elaborating as follows:</p>



<p>“He was so handsome and so fun and so … alive. Because I was so steeped in [my religious] way of looking at things, I thought it was a potential step into sin to even acknowledge that I was attracted to Jeremy, that I felt my heart tugged in his direction&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;And once we fell in love, the vibrancy of Jeremy’s outlook, faith, and devotion began to crack open a wider world of mercy and grace to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jinger Duggar has another reason to be grateful this week.</p>



<p>The former reality star, who is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jinger-duggar-pregnant-with-baby-3/">pregnant with her third child</a>, has now been married to husband Jeremy Vuolo for eight years.</p>



<p>For those wondering, the traditional gift for this milestone is bronze.</p>

<p>“You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” Duggar captioned an Instagram post on Tuesday, November 5 in honor of this occasion.</p>



<p>&#8220;The past 8 years with you has been the best adventure of my life. You are my best friend and answer my prayers. God is so kind to let me journey through life by your side.”</p>



<p>Alongside her romantic and precious caption, Duggar shared one photo for each year that she and Vuolo have a romantic item.</p>



<p>The spouses met 2015 and got engaged the following year&#8230; before getting married November 2016. Yes, it all happened very fast, as it so often does with members of the Duggar family.</p>

<p>In hindsight, the couple agrees that its first year of marriage was the most challenging.</p>



<p>“I’m looking back eight years in [and] going, ‘That year was a breeze.’ … But then you [said] last night, ‘No, I think it was the hardest,’ and I think I agree with you,” Vuolo said during an episode of their Jinger &amp; Jeremy Podcast in September. “We faced so much adjustment and so much change.”</p>



<p>In July 2018, Jinger and Jeremy welcomed their first child, a daughter named Felicity.</p>



<p>Their second daughter, Evangeline Jo, was born in November 2020, a blessing which followed the tragedy of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/08/jinger-duggar-reveals-heartbreak-of-miscarriage-it-was-not-norma/">miscarriage Duggar suffered</a> in between giving birth to these kids.</p>

<p>Fast forward to just a few weeks ago and Duggar confirming she was expecting once again.</p>



<p>“We’re super excited,” she told People Magazine in an interview that went viral on October 15. </p>



<p>“I’m actually all about it. Especially in the heat the past few days, I think I’m not super big pregnant and so I’m not having to worry about the extra heat. I’m like, ‘Oh man, this is going to be such an awesome thing to go through pregnancy, not in the summer.’”</p>



<p>The husband and wife were planning for this upcoming newborn, and aren&#8217;t certain whether or not he/she will be their final offspring.</p>



<p>“I felt like I was set with two, but I don’t know. Three was kind of what we had always said was a really good number,” Duggar told People. </p>



<p>“So, three or four. I don’t know. But I think three is what I’m leaning towards right now.”</p>

<p>As you might expect from members of this family, Jinger and Jeremy &#8212; who are parents to daughters Felicity, 6, and Evangeline, 3 &#8212; were trying for a third child.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean Jeremy didn&#8217;t react with surprise when the baby was confirmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;When she told me, I was literally speechless,&#8221; Vuolo said to People, adding in further detail: </p>



<p>&#8220;She got me good. It was on Felicity&#8217;s birthday. Jinger says, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a gift for you.&#8217; It was in an Amazon bag. So I&#8217;m thinking, &#8216;What did she get from Amazon for me?&#8217; Then I open it up and it&#8217;s the positive result, and I&#8217;m actually speechless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spouses got married in 2016.</p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jinger-duggar-new-house-jeremy-vuolo/">moved into a new home in August</a> and therefore, we assume at least, have plenty of room for their expanding immediate family.</p>



<p>“Felicity started jumping up and down in excitement over the news,” Jinger told People of how her current kids reacted to hearing they&#8217;d soon have a sibling. </p>



<p>“Evangeline wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of the news. But we are certain that once the baby arrives, she will be all about her new role as big sis.”</p>

<p>And this obviously won&#8217;t be the last kid for this <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jinger-duggar-new-book-details/">best-selling author</a>, right?</p>



<p>Does any Duggar woman stop procreating after a mere three children?</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, I felt like I was set with two, but I don&#8217;t know. Three was kind of what we had always said was a really good number,&#8221; Jinger says on this topic, concluding with a tease and a mystery: </p>



<p>&#8220;So three or four. I don&#8217;t know. But I think three is what I&#8217;m leaning towards right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout her tumultuous childhood, Jinger Duggar often was prohibited from speaking her mind.</p>



<p>Her famous parents fiercely guarded their privacy while making public spectacles of their children.</p>



<p>The result, for Jinger and her siblings, was a disorienting childhood in which they were frequently asked to smile for the camera while simultaneously concealing dark family secrets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so consumed with what everyone around me thought about me,&#8221; she told the outlet on Tuesday.</p>



<p>&#8220;And oftentimes, I saw how it just started to get serious when it started affecting my relationships or just really causing me to reject certain relationships because I was afraid of what that person might think of me,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought like, &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m too fat.&#8217; Even though I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was afraid of eating too much because I was like, &#8216;Oh no, my friends aren&#8217;t going to like me because they&#8217;re skinnier than me.'&#8221; </p>



<p>Jinger added that she was eventually able to overcome her troubled relationship with food through the help of her family and friends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jinger-s-message-to-fans">Jinger&#8217;s Message to Fans</h2>



<p>With her new book, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jinger-duggar-talks-returning-to-reality-tv-despite-being-traumatized/">Jinger hopes to offer guidance</a> to fans who might be struggling in a similar fashion.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wake up, we scroll, we see everybody&#8217;s perfect lives, and we&#8217;re trying to compare ourselves to then meet up to their standards of what they expect us to be,&#8221; she told <em>People</em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of these are just imaginary expectations. So, I wanted to write a book that would be more relatable, in a sense. Like, &#8216;Okay, we are all in this place of people-pleasing. </p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have it all figured out, but this is what I&#8217;m learning on this journey of trying to be set free from this. There is an answer, there is a solution.'&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure that like most people, Jinger still struggles with the burden of imaginary expectations from time to time.</p>



<p>But it sounds like she&#8217;s made tremendous strides in her healing journey. And we admire her willingness to help others do the same.</p>
