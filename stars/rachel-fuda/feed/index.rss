<p>She may not know from where she&#8217;s getting her first paycheck.</p>



<p>But Rachel Fuda knows how she&#8217;ll be spending the next few weeks of her life: By cradling a precious newborn in her arms. (And probably not getting a ton of sleep).</p>



<p>Indeed, folks, the reality star just welcomed a baby!</p>

<p>Fuda broke the blessed piece of news herself in an interview with People Magazine.</p>



<p>His name is Lorenzo Antonio Fuda and&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;With the birth of our last baby, our family has grown into everything we ever dreamed &#8212; a beautiful circle of six hearts, bound by love, laughter, and the journey we’ve shared,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/rachel-fuda-welcomes-baby-boy-exclusive-11680902">Fuda said to this outlet</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This little soul is our final piece, the sweetest ending to a chapter of beginnings, and the start of a lifetime of cherished moments together.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519813" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1794002100-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">John Fuda and Rachel Fuda attend the world premiere of Good Burger 2 in NYC on November 14, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Paramount+)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The newborn joins the three kids Rachel shares with husband John Fuda: daughters Gianella Jolie, 4, and Giuliana Rose, 2, as well as Jaiden &#8230; John’s 18-year-old son from a previous relationship, whom Rachel adopted.</p>



<p>Added the Bravo personality to People:</p>



<p>&#8220;Our hearts are fuller, our home is brighter — our baby boy is here, and I am so grateful to be a mother again.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Fuda, the spouses used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to get pregnant, the same process they used to conceive Gianella and Giuliana. </p>



<p>&#8220;We always had the room for one more in our home and in our hearts, and we&#8217;re both just so happy to be welcoming another baby into the family. It felt like it was time,&#8221; Rachel also told People in August, back when she confirmed her expecting again.</p>

<p>This exciting personal development comes amid a difficult professional rumor surrounding Fuda and others.</p>



<p>Based on a recent OK! Magazine report, there <em>will</em> be a Season 15 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. But it will not include certain cast members.</p>



<p>Margaret Josephs, Danielle Cabral and Rachel Fuda were not given retention notices, and, at this time, Bravo is not pursuing them for a spot on RHONJ or any other side projects,&#8221; wrote this tabloid a few days ago.</p>



<p>This same article alleges Fuda was a “strong contender” to return, but her husband stood in the way because he was “difficult to deal with behind the scenes and [producers] didn’t feel it was worth the headache.”</p>



<p><em>Yikes</em>, huh? Let&#8217;s hope his new son never reads that paragraph.</p>

<p>The cast of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> will have a lot to discuss on the Season 13 Reunion.</p>



<p>And believe it or not, we&#8217;re not just talking about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-feud-puts-rhonj-season-14-on-hiatus/">Teresa and Melissa&#8217;s toxic feud</a>.</p>

<p>The promo for the Reunion shows the Housewives sitting down with Andy, and everything from him losing his cool to Luis and Teresa throwing out threats at castmates. It&#8217;s a mess.</p>

<p>In the Season 13 Reunion trailer, which you can watch for yourself below, things are tense from the start.</p>



<p>Even while everyone is just getting situated, Melissa Gorga reminds sister-in-law Teresa Giudice to &#8220;control herself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this the opening salvo of the Reunion&#8217;s hostilities, or is it a response to something that Teresa has already said or done? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>

<p>As trailers tend to do, we get a lot of montages without a lot of context.</p>



<p>There is a lot of bad blood. That is no secret. The trailer also offers individual moments, as people give updates on family situations and relationships.</p>



<p>But then, we get to see some specific hostilities emerge.</p>

<p>Not pulling her punches, Teresa leans forward.</p>



<p>She calls her castmate &#8220;a devil.&#8221; And all indicators suggest that she is speaking to Margaret Josephs.</p>



<p>(Or, as Teresa has her listed in her phone, &#8220;Margret Joseph&#8221;)</p>

<p>One of the hints that she is speaking to Margaret is that we then see her lean forward and speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a criminal,&#8221; she seemingly tells Teresa.</p>



<p>And, she apparently adds, so is Luis Ruelas. We all know how Teresa feels when people criticize Luis.</p>

<p>Rachel Fuda&#8217;s reaction here is priceless.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to make a splash (without going overboard) on your first season.</p>



<p>But Rachel has definitely made some ripples this season. A lot of people hope to see her again.</p>

<p>Seriously, Teresa did not hold back when it came to leveling threats.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we see her taunt another castmate by saying &#8220;sleep with one eye open.&#8221;</p>



<p>Either editors are really playing fast and loose with context, or Tre just threatened a fellow Housewife.</p>

<p>Rachel and Danielle have a back-and-forth, though we cannot take our eyes off of the gorgeous purple of Danielle&#8217;s dress.</p>



<p>Then, when Jennifer hurls childish insults at Margaret, she dismisses them.</p>



<p>Why? She&#8217;s more concerned about what she&#8217;s been hearing about private investigators.</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs to defend himself,&#8221; Melissa explains of Luis&#8217; behavior, &#8220;by having a folder on all of us.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, a lot of troubling things from Luis&#8217; life came out when he first entered Teresa&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>So, he has loudly claimed, he is working to secure private info &#8212; blackmail material, potentially &#8212; against his critics. That is to say, all of Teresa&#8217;s castmates. (Bo Dietl, for the record, has quashed the claim of his involvement)</p>

<p>Even though Teresa has admitted that Luis was speaking in the heat of the moment, the two seem committed to aggression at the Reunion.</p>



<p>Luis calls out that he has information on at least one castmate during the trailer.</p>



<p>And the couple&#8217;s paranoia is such that Andy has to yell considerably to share a bit of odd news.</p>

<p>Andy learns from a producer that a security guard is trying to come upstairs and join the reunion special.</p>



<p>Apparently, he works for Teresa and Luis.</p>



<p>They claim that they have received death threats. That does sometimes happen on reality TV. What&#8217;s probably not reasonable is having the guard at the Reunion, in the room. Production is prepared for a fight, if one happens.</p>

<p>We also hear Teresa strongly claim that Melissa is leaving the show &#8212; against her will.</p>



<p>(Whatever she is doing with her eyes in that moment, it&#8217;s not <em>smizing</em>)</p>



<p>Teresa doesn&#8217;t officially have the power to do that. However, she may believe that she can strong-arm production into firing her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>We are not sure how she will explain, but we&#8217;re sure that she will.</p>

<p>She says that her (adult) child received a harassing phone call and threats at work.</p>



<p>It appears that there is some evidence to support this, despite Teresa&#8217;s insistence that &#8220;he would never do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>We also see a more sorrowful presentation from Teresa.</p>



<p>She cries.</p>



<p>But she also seems to call her own brother &#8220;disgraceful,&#8221; so clearly, she&#8217;s dealing with more than just sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, I really can&#8217;t,&#8221; a hoarsely crying Teresa says.</p>



<p>She stands up and walks away, lifting the train of her gown as she slowly &#8220;storms&#8221; off of the stage.</p>



<p>&#8220;You should be ashamed of yourself,&#8221; she yells.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t come followin&#8217; me!&#8221; she yells at the cameras and at producers, whose jobs are of course to do just that.</p>



<p>What a mess! And it all starts on Tuesday, May 30.</p>

<p>Despite some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/margaret-josephs-tears-into-jennifer-aydin-during-bitter-rhonj-fight/">bitter fights on <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em></a>, viewers recently witnessed an unexpected olive branch. From a very unlikely source.</p>



<p>Teresa Giudice, of all people, invited Margaret Josephs to come over and hang out. Margaret was not the only person in shock over it.</p>



<p>Has Teresa suddenly developed emotional maturity?</p>



<p>No, Melissa Gorga explains. Instead, Luis Ruelas is manipulating her and the entire group to stop more secrets from getting out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Seated beside husband Joe Gorga, Melissa Gorga relays her own theories about her castmates&#8217; behavior to a newcomer. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So much of this episode of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> centered upon softball, but it somehow managed to not be a snooze-fest.</p>



<p>Instead, we saw Melissa Gorga and her husband (and others, including Frank Catania) sit down for some food and chit-chat.</p>



<p>Melissa was eager to share her theories about recent events with Rachel Fuda. Rachel is a newcomer, and &#8212; in theory &#8212; could make a valuable ally in current and future feuds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Fuda affirms that she is &#8220;literally not afraid of anybody,&#8221; and notes that she will not allow her castmates to influence her one way or the other. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rachel warned, while speaking to the confessional camera, that she doesn&#8217;t plan on letting anyone push her in one direction or another.</p>



<p>Oh, she&#8217;ll listen to what the other Housewives have to say about themselves or each other.</p>



<p>But she has no intention of allowing anyone to influence her. That includes Melissa, by the way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In a flashback, The Real Housewives of New Jersey shows Margaret Josephs reacting with stunned surprise and then a joke after receiving an invitation. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The topic at hand was Teresa&#8217;s invitation towards Margaret. When she invited her, Margaret responded with shock and then jokingly asked if Tre was planning to murder and bury her.</p>



<p>But to hear Teresa tell it, she was simply inviting her over for a normal social get-together. Despite their strong clashes.</p>



<p>“Listen, I see Luis for what he is,” Melissa told the confessional camera. “He’s charming, but he’s also very manipulating.” And yes, this is absolutely about the Margaret thing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Speaking to the confessional camera, Melissa Gorga explains the strategy behind her estranged sister-in-law&#8217;s behavior, and who is masterminding it. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s so obvious that Luis told her to be good to Margaret,&#8221; Melissa explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;‘Don’t f&#8211;k with Margaret, because we’re gonna need Margaret to stop telling all of the truth about us that’s what we’re gonna need,'&#8221; she imagined Luis telling Teresa.</p>



<p>After all, it was Margaret who brought up several troubling details about Luis&#8217; past.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga says that there was only one reason for a recent olive branch, and it had nothing to do with kindness. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Melissa, Teresa&#8217;s diplomatic gesture towards Margaret was the “fakest s&#8211;t I’ve ever seen.”</p>



<p>“She hates f&#8211;king Margaret,” she emphasized. “I don’t care what you say, what you say, what Teresa says, what Luis says, what Luis’ buddha says!” That was a nod to Teresa&#8217;s current vibe.</p>



<p>“She can’t stand f–king Margaret, she can’t stand me, and she can’t stand him, and that’s a fact,&#8221; Melissa noted. &#8220;And that’s why I’m not rolling with the whole fake f&#8211;king parade that’s been happening,”</p>

That is a colossal understatement. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier in the episode, Teresa spoke to the camera about how she has not always come across with the right tone.</p>



<p>(Shadily, the show played a montage of Teresa flipping out, flipping a table, and generally screaming and losing her mind over the years)</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Gia spoke at Dolores&#8217; charity softball game about how the ongoing conflict has impacted the younger family members.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousins are growing up so fast,&#8221; she noted. </p>



<p>&#8220;So every time I see them it just reminds me that I&#8217;m not able to be there for them as much as I would want to,&#8221; Gia added.</p>



<p>&#8220;It almost feels like my Zio Joe and Zia Melissa are trying to put a wedge between us and that&#8217;s definitely a feeling that doesn&#8217;t sit well with me,&#8221; Gia lamented. Are they really the culprits, though?</p>

<p>Last week, <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> viewers saw just how ugly things could get.</p>



<p>To be blunt, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/joe-gorga-threatens-to-break-luis-ruelas-effing-balls/">Joe Gorga threatened to break Luis Ruelas&#8217; f&#8211;king balls</a>. <em>His </em>words, not ours.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night, it was Jennifer Aydin&#8217;s turn to clash &#8212; this time with Rachel Fuda. Honestly? This ugly exchange of insults ended up being <em>very </em>funny. You&#8217;ll see.</p>



<p>Also, Melissa ended up attending Teresa&#8217;s &#8220;love bubble&#8221; party (ugh) solo. She came alone, and she left in tears.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Rachel Fuda made it clear that she was happy that the party&#8217;s host had invited her sister-in-law. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This week&#8217;s episode showed Teresa and Luis&#8217; big housewarming party, featuring mouthwatering platters of pasta.</p>



<p>The cast of stunned Housewives watched with the rest of us as Jennifer Aydin confronted Rachel Fuda.</p>



<p>“I called [Rachel] up and I said, ‘I’m sorry that I spoke about your nose job,’” Jennifer announced. “People bad-mouth me about my terrible nose job.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Love her, hate her, or just find her weirdly fascinating, Jennifer Aydin has been a fixture on The Real Housewives of New Jersey for years. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I felt bad about your terrible nose job, and I just felt bad. I was calling to apologize,&#8221; Jennifer explained. Hilarious.</p>



<p>In a flashback of Jennifer&#8217;s nose job jab (or faux pas, to hear her tell it), we hear Rachel explain to her friend Jennifer Fessler.</p>



<p>“So we leave the mozz party, she calls me [and] she’s like, ‘Hey, I hope I didn’t offend you by, like, bringing up your nose job. You know I’m just like not really happy with my results,’” Rachel recalled.</p>

<p>According to Rachel, the call swiftly became Jennifer &#8220;s&#8211;t talking&#8221; Dolores Catania at her, leaving her feeling uneasy.</p>



<p>So, at the party, Rachel confronted Jennifer. </p>



<p>“You had started talking s&#8211;t [about Catania], and what did I say to you? You said, ‘I’m giving context,’ and I said, ‘Jennifer, don’t get me involved,’” Rachel noted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Aydin wore this gorgeous sequined blouse in a rich jade green while speaking to the confessional camera. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That is not how Jennifer remembers it. She insisted that she was merely relating their &#8220;history&#8221; to Rachel. Sure.</p>



<p>When Rachel disagreed, Jennifer ended up shouting &#8220;You f&#8211;king idiot!&#8221;</p>



<p>“Watch your f&#8211;king mouth,” Rachel demanded, instructing her &#8220;do not call me an idiot.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Fuda did not back down while defending her recollection of things. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“You f&#8211;king idiot!” Aydin shouted at Fuda, who clapped back saying,  and “do not call me an idiot.”</p>



<p>“F–king idiot,” Jennifer repeated, doubling down.</p>



<p>At this point, both Dolores and Margaret tried to calm things down. And Dolores felt &#8220;offended&#8221; that Jennifer had been badmouthing you. Very understandable.</p>

<p>“You want a medal? That’s good! Somebody give her a medal!” Jennifer replied (sarcastically) when people tried to diffuse the situation.</p>



<p>At this point, Rachel grabbed her husband, John Fuda. The two began to walk away. “Keep it moving, don’t let the door hit you on the ass on the way out!” Jennifer taunted as they left.</p>



<p>Rachel snapped back: “There’s no door, asshole!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that was not the only ugly business of the night.</p>



<p>See, Teresa ended up inviting her brother, Joe, to her housewarming &#8220;love bubble&#8221; party with Luis Ruelas.</p>



<p>It was an olive branch. And Joe and Teresa both told each other &#8220;I love you&#8221; before hanging up. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Gorga broke the news to his wife that, despite the olive branch, he couldn&#8217;t quite bring himself to attend his sister&#8217;s party. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, he later told Melissa that he couldn&#8217;t go. He felt like it was a set-up. Given how things have been going with Luis, that&#8217;s understandable.</p>



<p>Melissa opted to attend anyway. An olive branch for an olive branch. She felt sad that her nieces couldn&#8217;t see their uncle that night.</p>



<p>And then this happened:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-470115" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice thanked her &#8220;chosen family&#8221; for attending her and Luis Ruelas&#8217; housewarming &#8220;love bubble&#8221; party, which felt like a jab.

<p>Both Luis and Teresa stood up on a table and thanked everyone for attending. No problem, right? (Also, credit where credit is due: Luis is wearing a fantastic shirt here)</p>



<p>Then they called the assembled guests Teresa&#8217;s &#8220;chosen family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Did that feel like an odd choice of words, even a hurtful choice, in light of Joe&#8217;s absence? Margaret sure thinks so.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Margaret Josephs immediately picked up on what seemed like a deliberate jab and offered her sympathies. She also accurately predicted how things would play out. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Immediately, a number of people in the crowd offered words of comfort to Melissa Gorga.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s there without her husband, already reeling emotionally.</p>



<p>Margaret also predicted to the camera precisely how Teresa would respond &#8212; claiming that she was simply saying something nice, and that she didn&#8217;t mean anything by it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga became tearful during her sister-in-law&#8217;s housewarming party on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether she meant something by it or not, Teresa&#8217;s words were hurtful.</p>



<p>Eventually, Melissa ended up leaving with tears in her eyes.</p>



<p>It was a hard night for her. The clash between Rachel and Jennifer was much more fun to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>We have all felt encouragement while watching <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/jackie-goldschneider-is-making-strides-battling-eating-disorder-im-not-there-yet/">Jackie Goldschneider make strides in her recovery from disordered eating</a>.</p>



<p>That does not mean that she has been front and center on <em>RHONJ</em>, however.</p>



<p>A very credible report says that Jackie is receiving a demotion to a &#8220;Friend of&#8221; role.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, newcomer Rachel Fuda will be taking her place as a Full Housewife.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/08/31/rhonj-season-13-newbie-rachel-fuda-replaces-jackie-goldschneider/"><em>Page Six</em> reports</a> that, per multiple inside sources, Rachel Fuda will star on Season 13.</p>



<p>Fellow newbie Danielle Cabral is also adding her name to the lineup.</p>



<p>Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Jennifer Aydin, Dolores Catania, and Margaret Josephs are all returning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Jackie Goldschneider is not, this report explains, leaving the series.</p>



<p>Instead, she is appearing as a &#8220;Friend&#8221; of the Housewives this season.</p>



<p>To be fair, she is a friend of some of them. But it sounds like her demotion may be a recent development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>See, this decision went down in the wake of Season 13 filming.</p>



<p>Principal photography on RHONJ wrapped &#8220;a few weeks ago,&#8221; the report details.</p>



<p>Danielle Cabral was <em>always </em>clearly a Full Housewife during filming, insiders dish.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, the status of <em>three </em>of the women remained unclear for a while.</p>



<p>Apparently, Bravo thrust them into a winner-take-all, dog-eat-dog drama fest to see who came out on top.</p>



<p>Those women were Jackie Goldschneider, Rachel Fuda, and Jennifer &#8220;Jenn&#8221; Fessler &#8220;competed&#8221; for Full Housewife status.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="420" height="310" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/jackie-goldschneider-awkwardly-enrages-teresa-giudice.gif" alt="Jackie Goldschneider Awkwardly Enrages Teresa Giudice" class="wp-image-321931"/><figcaption>The Real Housewives of New Jersey stars respond with absolute horror as Jackie Goldschneider brings up Teresa Giudice&#8217;s husband&#8217;s incarceration in her effort to prove a point.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jenn is a fellow newcomer, even though it should be a <em>crime </em>for two Housewives on the same show to share a first name.</p>



<p>(Maybe <em>crime </em>is an overstatement, but either get a nickname or move to a new city! I&#8217;m not kidding!)</p>



<p>Notably, at least one source said that the cast always knew that Jenn Fessler was destined for a Friend role.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>After the season wrapped and the dust settled, Bravo made the call.</p>



<p>Rachel Fuda, the bigwigs decided, would usurp Jackie&#8217;s role.</p>



<p>At least, that&#8217;s what the report says. <em>Officially</em>, Bravo says that nothing is set in stone just yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs, Dolores Catania, Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Aydin. Those are the Real Housewives and this is their world. Everyone else is just living in it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re part of the Jack-Jack-Jackie Hive and feel a crawling sense of despair, don&#8217;t panic.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a &#8220;Friend&#8221; role means only appearing in three episodes, like a relative visiting from out of town.</p>



<p>But the report shares that Jackie and the other Friends filmed all season and are &#8220;featured heavily&#8221; in the Season 13 storylines.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jackie Goldschneider smiles here and poses for the camera. She shared this photo on Instagram.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, insiders seem to be at odds about how Jackie feels about this demotion.</p>



<p>One source says that she feels &#8220;unhappy&#8221; about Bravo&#8217;s decision.</p>



<p>Another affirms that she &#8220;feels great about her season.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Teresa Giudice, Jackie Goldschneider, and Melissa Gorga go to war on part two of The Real Housewives of New Jersey reunion. </figcaption></figure>



<p>That same second insider went on to claim that Jackie is happy to focus upon other things going on in her life right now.</p>



<p>The second one has the vibe of someone putting on a brave face, right?</p>



<p>Either way, it will be interesting to see how this casting upset impacts Season 13. We all know that even small changes can have dire consequences.</p>
