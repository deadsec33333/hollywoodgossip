<p>Amy Duggar is proving once again that she has no interest in adhering to the strict code of conduct made famous by her overbearing uncle, Jim Bob.</p>



<p>For years, Amy has had a reputation as the resident rebel of TV&#8217;s most famous fundamentalist family.</p>



<p>And these days &#8212; inspired, perhaps, by the example set by her defiant cousins &#8212; she&#8217;s pushing the envelope like never before.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amy-duggar-makes-her-own-rules">Amy Duggar Makes Her Own Rules</h2>



<p>Even during <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jim-bob-duggar-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Duggars&#8217; heyday as reality stars</a>, Amy was in the habit of rolling her eyes at Jim Bob&#8217;s nonsense and doing her own thing.</p>



<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/josh-duggar-i-never-molested-my-sisters-im-the-victim-of-a-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Duggar sex scandals</a> and the family&#8217;s downfall, Amy has become an outspoken critic of her infamous uncle.</p>



<p>Along with her cousin Jill, Amy was one of only two Duggars to appear in the controversial Amazon Prime documentary <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/the-duggars-to-be-exposed-again-on-shiny-happy-people-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Happy People</a></em>.</p>

<p>In the film, she spoke candidly about the agony of watching her cousins grow up in such an authoritarian environment.</p>



<p>But Amy&#8217;s rebellion isn&#8217;t all about reliving her painful past.</p>



<p>Sometimes, she likes to celebrate her freedom from Jim Bob by reveling in the sort of pleasures he strictly forbids!</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Amy posted some Instagram pics that Jim Bob definitely would <em>not</em> approve of.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn’t sad .. turns out I just needed a hot tub date night [with] my Taz!&#8221; Amy captioned the post.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with the<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/joy-anna-duggar-dress-code-sinful-dancing-jim-bob/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Duggar dress code</a> that requires girls and women to dress &#8220;modestly&#8221; at all times.</p>



<p>Well, Amy&#8217;s bikini probably doesn&#8217;t meet the requirements.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the fact that she and husband Dillon King are sipping champagne in the pics.</p>



<p>Alcohol is strictly forbidden in Jim Bob&#8217;s world, and he reportedly wasn&#8217;t happy when he learned that his daughter <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/09/jill-duggar-mocks-trolls-look-im-drinking-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jill had started drinking</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, that was before <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/jill-duggar-has-her-controversial-memoir-made-her-a-millionaire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jill published a memoir</a> in which she detailed some of the more difficult aspects of growing up in such a strict family.</p>

<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/amy-duggar-tell-all-book-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy is writing a memoir</a> of her own. And Jim Bob probably isn&#8217;t thrilled about the project.</p>



<p>Perhaps he feels like the cousins are teaming up against him. But the more likely explanation is that they both realized independently that they couldn&#8217;t be happy if they continued to adhere to the ridiculous rules JB laid out for them.</p>



<p>Amy and Jill probably have no personal beef with Jim Bob. In fact, Jill has said that she would like to work on her relationship with her dad.</p>



<p>But both women will likely continue to live life on their terms and tell their stories as they see fit.</p>



<p>And Jim Bob will no doubt view those actions as an assault on his values and beliefs.</p>

<p>Josh Duggar should suffer in prison forever as far as his cousin, Amy Duggar, is concerned.</p>



<p>Disgraced criminal <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jim-bob-and-michelle-duggar-visit-josh-in-prison-bond-with-convicted-sex-offender/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Duggar remains in prison</a>, where he receives occasional visits from some family members.</p>

As a person and as a prisoner, Josh is the furthest thing from being a model citizen.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s likely that Josh is having a miserable time in prison. Amy hopes that it gets worse for him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-josh-duggar-is-in-prison">Josh Duggar is in prison</h2>



<p>In April of 2021, following the 2020 Homeland Security raid on his place of business, authorities arrested <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/josh-duggar-receiving-special-privileges-in-prison-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="510">Josh Duggar</a> for receiving and possessing child sexual abuse materials (CSAM).</p>



<p>During his trial late that year, the court heard gruesome details of the photos and video that he obtained. Josh was so caught up in hiding his twisted interests from his wife and the rest of his family that he seemingly forgot that what he was doing was <em>illegal</em>.</p>



<p>The court convicted Josh on December 9 of 2021. On May 25 of 2022, Josh received a nearly 13-year prison sentence. His attempts to appeal his case have, if anything, backfired. As it stands, he will remain behind bars until October of 2032.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really hope that,&#8221; she then explained, &#8220;because what he watched and what he was viewing for his own fulfillment is those kids experiencing torture.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">Amy, who is also a mother, affirmed: &#8220;He deserves every second in there, and I hope he gets a longer term. I hope he messes up again.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-amy-refers-to-torture-she-means-at-least-part-of-that-very-literally">When Amy refers to &#8216;torture,&#8217; she means at least part of that very literally</h2>



<p>It sounds like &#8212; and please keep in mind that we have followed the trial closely but are not experts in criminal investigations &#8212; Josh downloaded a torrent file (that is, a collection of tiny files that he obtained via peer-to-peer software and then reassembled; many programs update using this <em>usually innocuous </em>technology). </p>



<p>This file apparently contained numerous images and videos, and while it&#8217;s unclear which piqued Josh&#8217;s interest and which files he fully downloaded, at least some parts of the collection were the work of Australian murderer and rapist Peter Scully.</p>



<p>Scully&#8217;s unspeakable crimes targeted teen girls and little girls, and victims as young as 18 months. Even if Josh&#8217;s interests were more likely in less violent media featuring older prepubescent victims, those were still very young girls whose lives were being ruined. That is why Amy hopes that he suffers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amy-also-knows-josh-duggar-s-own-victims">Amy also knows Josh Duggar&#8217;s own victims</h2>



<p>In addition to her obvious sympathy for the children in the CSAM that Josh pursued and acquired, Josh molested multiple young girls when he was a teenager. That included four of his own sisters &#8212; meaning that they were Amy&#8217;s cousins.</p>



<p>Josh felt protected then. He went on to cheat on his wife and download CSAM. Because Josh has never seemed genuinely interested in atoning or getting better, Amy said that she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;know if he&#8217;s doing any work&#8221; to become a decent person in prison.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have not spoken to him, and I will not. I will not,&#8221; Amy affirmed. &#8220;When you just cross those evil lines like that, there is no coming back. I just think there&#8217;s no coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna&#8217;s continued misplaced loyalty in the monster that she married makes things <em>beyond </em>awkward. Amy did run into Anna at a funeral in 2023, but that was it.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0">&#8220;That was the last time. I wasn&#8217;t really expecting to see anyone there, and I was shocked to see her,&#8221; Amy recalled of the encounter. &#8220;I just looked at her and I said, &#8216;Anna,&#8217; and she was like, &#8216;I just need space.&#8217; That&#8217;s all she said to me.&#8221;</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0">&#8220;I understand, I can&#8217;t speak for Anna and I&#8217;m not going to try,&#8221; Amy affirmed.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0">&#8220;But I can&#8217;t imagine what she has to deal with internally, let alone out for the world to see,&#8221; she acknowledged.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0">&#8220;It&#8217;s heartbreaking in every direction,&#8221; Amy pointed out. &#8220;And I just respected the fact that she needed space and I didn&#8217;t try to push any further.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-wasn-t-the-right-time-for-an-anna-duggar-intervention">It wasn&#8217;t the right time for an Anna Duggar intervention</h2>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0">&#8220;It was a ceremony, a viewing actually, at a funeral, and yeah. It wasn&#8217;t the right timing,&#8221; Amy admitted. &#8220;And I didn&#8217;t want to make a scene.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0">The Duggar cousin continued: &#8220;And I didn&#8217;t want to do that or draw attention to anything and clearly respect her so I didn&#8217;t. But if you ask me, I think she is mad. I do. I think she&#8217;s just really, really mad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Misdirected anger is a very common coping mechanism. It&#8217;s not a healthy one, however. Amy is, on her worst day, perhaps a little attention-hungry. Josh is a monster.</p>

<p>Is Amy Duggar writing a Tell All book?</p>



<p>Fans and critics alike are never entirely sure when the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/amy-duggar-is-she-pregnant-with-her-second-child-or-is-she-just-trolling-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famed Duggar cousin is trolling them</a>.</p>



<p>But right now, she&#8217;s teasing a new writing project.</p>



<p>For years, Amy has hoped to expose her despicable uncle and aunt. Is her memoir going to reveal more dirty Duggar secrets?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-on-tiktok-amy-duggar-is-teasing-a-tell-all-book-probably">On TikTok, Amy Duggar is teasing a Tell All book &#8230; probably</h2>



<p>Just days ago, Amy Rachelle King &#8212; whom fans know best as Amy Duggar &#8212; took to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@amyrking/video/7326184951731326250?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> to upload a teaser video.</p>



<p>In the post, the infamous &#8220;black sheep&#8221; of the Duggar family wears pajamas and sits in bed while frantically typing on her laptop.</p>



<p>The video includes a series of clips of this nature. Clearly, the compilation implies that she has been typing like this nonstop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been busy lately …&nbsp;#newproject,&#8221; Amy captioned the video.</p>



<p>In case the visual contents of the video were too subtle, the instrumental music to the video is a song titled &#8220;Write.&#8221;</p>



<p>We know that Amy has been writing. The only question is what she has been cooking up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-have-one-theory-for-amy-duggar-and-her-writing-project">Fans have one theory for Amy Duggar and her writing project</h2>



<p>Though several commenters commented on Amy&#8217;s dramatized, fake typing for the video, others zeroed in on the project itself.</p>



<p>Everyone is assuming that she is working on a Tell All book. A Duggar cousin memoir would be a hot topic among longtime Duggar critics who long to see Jim Bob exposed and deposed (so to speak).</p>



<p>Amy wouldn&#8217;t be the first in the family to write a book about her experiences. But she might have some unique perspectives on things &#8230; and more to share than her cousins have thus far..</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yes-jinger-and-jill-both-came-out-with-memoirs">Yes, Jinger and Jill both came out with memoirs</h2>



<p>Jim Bob and Michelle raised Jinger and Jill in a cult upbringing. </p>



<p>And though Amy&#8217;s cousin status allowed her certain freedoms, she spent more than enough time growing up under that roof to see what their extreme lifestyle is really like.</p>



<p>Jill came out with <em>Counting The Cost</em>. Jinger came out with <em>Becoming Free Indeed</em>. But neither Duggar daughter seemed fully prepared to unload on Jim Bob as he deserves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jill-s-memoir-focused-upon-the-finances-and-deceit">Jill&#8217;s memoir focused upon the finances and deceit</h2>



<p>For Jill Duggar and husband Derick Dillard, much of the breaking point &#8212; the focus of their outspoken anger &#8212; had to do with Jim Bob&#8217;s dishonesty.</p>



<p>True, they are not raising their children in the cult. They are even giving their children an actual chance at life, sending them to actual schools.</p>



<p>But they have worked to expose Jim Bob for how he underpaid them (until they were ready to take him to court), collecting TLC paychecks for himself while telling his family that their reality TV jobs were a form of ministry.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jinger-isn-t-prioritizing-exposing-jim-bob-for-one-key-reason">Jinger isn&#8217;t prioritizing exposing Jim Bob for one key reason</h2>



<p>Yes, Jinger has spoken about her criticisms the way that her awful parents raised her. And she does want to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jinger-duggar-praises-documentary-for-exposing-bill-gothard-iblp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expose the IBLP cult and its notorious founder</a>.</p>



<p>But in <em>Becoming Free Indeed </em>and in interviews, Jinger is so reluctant to speak too harshly because she worries that it could reflect poorly upon all of Christianity.</p>



<p>In fact, it often sounds like her primary concern is that these fundamentalist organizations and beliefs hurt the brand of Christianity. That&#8217;s not an unfair concern &#8230; but Jinger&#8217;s priorities weakened her memoir.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-amy-duggar-the-best-person-to-write-a-tell-all-book">Is Amy Duggar the best person to write a Tell All book?</h2>



<p>Truth be told, the <em>best </em>Duggar Tell All would be from someone who is no-contact with the main Duggar family, grew up in that household, and is a full apostate.</p>



<p>Even Jill still talks to sisters, and so she has ties to Jim Bob and Michelle in that sense. Jinger hangs out with family. Both remain devout Christians with very conservative beliefs outside of mainstream American Christianity.</p>



<p>One day, maybe a LGBTQ+ Duggar offspring will break ranks and cut all ties. <em>That </em>person could write a perfect Tell All.</p>

<p>Yes, she seems to like attention. And yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/amy-duggar-i-wanna-break-my-nda-so-i-can-really-discuss-the-josh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Duggar&#8217;s NDA</a> is probably going to be an obstacle in anything that she does.</p>



<p>But Amy has the least to lose if Jim Bob goes to war with her. Some of her cousins cannot say the same &#8212; especially those who depend upon him for financial support.</p>



<p>If Amy does come out with a memoir, we&#8217;ll be intrigued to hear what she (and the likely ghostwriter) has to say.</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/amy-duggar-heres-why-fans-think-shes-secretly-pregnant-with-baby-2/">Amy Duggar pregnant with her second child</a>?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a question that fans have been debating for weeks &#8212; and with good reason!</p>



<p>Usually, social media pregnancy rumors are based on little more than rude speculation from crass commenters.</p>



<p>But Amy&#8217;s case is a little different, as it often seems that she&#8217;s dropping hints with the goal of providing grist for the rumor mill.</p>

<p>Now, Amy&#8217;s fondness for Instagram is no secret.</p>



<p>In fact, she&#8217;s so active on the platform that haters have christened her with the unflattering nickname &#8220;Famy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Critics think Amy is obsessed with riding the coattails of her more popular cousins, and they might be onto something.</p>



<p>After all, what stay-at-home mom <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to seize the opportunity to rake some serious cash as an influencer?</p>

<p>And since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/amy-duggar-outta-the-way-jill-im-writing-my-own-book-and-i-am-not-gonna-go-easy-on-jim-bob/">Amy is working on a memoir</a>, we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s more focused than ever on generating free publicity.</p>



<p>But would she falsely hint that she&#8217;s got a baby on the way just to boost her engagement metrics?</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything we know about the situation so far:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-speculation-begins">The Speculation Begins</h2>



<p>Back in October, commenters alleged that Amy had started wearing looser-fitting clothing.</p>



<p>There could be any number of reasons for that, but naturally, the most dramatic explanation quickly emerged as the favorite.</p>



<p>Soon, the Duggar-obsessed corners of the internet were abuzz with news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/amy-duggar-caught-hiding-baby-bump-on-instagram/">Amy was hiding a baby bump</a>. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="680" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-680x1024.jpg" alt="Amy Duggar and husband at a red carpet event" class="wp-image-490024" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-768x1156.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-1360x2048.jpg 1360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-735x1106.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-345x520.jpg 345w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-425x640.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-510x768.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-638x960.jpg 638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-717x1080.jpg 717w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1071897908-scaled.jpg 1701w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dillon King (L) and Amy Duggar attend WE tv celebrates the return of &#8220;Love After Lockup&#8221; with panel, &#8220;Real Love: Relationship Reality TV&#8217;s Past, Present &amp; Future,&#8221; at The Paley Center for Media on December 11, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Alberto E.

<p>All these months later, she still hasn&#8217;t made any sort of announcement, but many of her followers believe that Amy has been dropping subtle hints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-december-to-remember">A December to Remember</h2>



<p>Last month, Amy posted a fun little holiday meme that probably wouldn&#8217;t have garnered much attention under normal circumstances.</p>



<p>But since she posted it in the midst of some intense pregnancy speculation, the amateur sleuths of the internet started picking it apart for clues.</p>



<p>&#8220;December will be filled with good news,&#8221; the meme read.</p>



<p>&#8220;December will be filled with blessings. December will be filled with progress. December will be filled with new experiences and love.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s not exactly concrete evidence, but you can see why some folks jumped to the conclusion that it was the prelude to a big announcement.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-final-clue">The Final Clue?</h2>



<p>And then there&#8217;s the matter of the suspicious Instagram Story that appeared on Amy&#8217;s Instagram page earlier this week.</p>



<p>According to a new report from The Sun, fans think the photo is <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/10040237/counting-on-amy-duggar-covers-stomach-pregnancy-speculation/">Amy&#8217;s way of responding to all of the pregnancy rumors</a>.</p>



<p>The image shows Amy smiling at the camera while reclining in a bathrobe and writing on a laptop.</p>



<p>Some commenters seem to feel that the sly smile, the bathrobe, and the computer monitor reflected in Amy&#8217;s glasses combine to create the impression that she&#8217;s about to announce something big &#8212; something like a pregnancy!</p>

<p></p>



<p>Maybe those folks are right, and we&#8217;ll soon learn that Amy Duggar is pregnant with baby number two.</p>



<p>But if you ask us, the more likely explanation for all of this recent weirdness is that Amy is simply enjoying the attention.</p>



<p>And we don&#8217;t blame her! </p>



<p>Hey, few things are more satisfying than trolling social media weirdos who are way too invested in the details of your private life!</p>

<p>Plenty of people <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/amy-duggar-gets-slammed-for-sponsorship-deal-with-car-dealership-stop-riding-your-cousins-coattails/">give Amy Duggar a hard time</a> on social media. Some believe that she&#8217;s a clout-chaser. </p>



<p>Others doubt her sincerity as she condemns the IBLP cult. And then there are Duggar apologists <em>defending </em>Josh and Jim Bob.</p>



<p>For the most part, Amy takes these critiques in stride. But not when people go after her son.</p>



<p>Are &#8220;fans&#8221; being cruel to Daxton? Or is Amy refusing to hear what they have to say.</p>

<p>What are these recent &#8220;attacks&#8221; all about? We&#8217;ll let Amy herself tell you, in a caption from late Tuesday night.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve had just about enough comments from grown women,&#8221; she began.</p>



<p>Amy felt so over people &#8220;commenting on my son’s hair in all of his pictures.&#8221; And, to be clear, not favorably.</p>

<p>&#8220;GROWN WOMEN ATTACKING A 4 YEAR OLD,&#8221; Amy accused. &#8220;How pathetic and sad is that?&#8221;<br><br>Amy asked: &#8220;Can we all just try to do better? Ask yourself why do I need to give my opinion about something that doesn’t even pertain to me?&#8221; A fair question.</p>



<p>&#8220;It makes me not want to post at all,&#8221; Amy expressed. &#8220;It’s annoying, frustrating, and so wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the time I just let negative comments roll off my back,&#8221; Amy charactereized. &#8220;But as a mama bear it’s time for me to say something.&#8221;</p>



<p>She emphasized: &#8220;Let me make this crystal clear I don’t care what your opinion is about anything to do with my life or my little family. If having a cool rad mullet makes him happy then we are going to cheer him on as parents! He’s only young once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to grow it out , we might perm it gasp) he wants to enter in a mullet competition!&#8221; Amy threatened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heck he might want a spiked Mohawk,&#8221; she suggested. Now <em>that </em>could be cool. &#8220;All I know is no matter I will support him and defend him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amy continued: &#8220;Who knows what the future holds for this lil guy but all I know is he’s got style and he’s not afraid to be himself and that alone is such a special trait! He has a personality that just doesn’t quit and I’m just trying to keep up with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can attack me all you want. I’m strong I can handle it,&#8221; Amy offered.</p>



<p>She affirmed: &#8220;I’ve been through enough hell to know I can take a lot of crap from a lot of people.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amy then concluded: &#8220;But don’t you dare attack my cub.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truth be told, the mullet is &#8212; infamously &#8212; one of the worst hairstyles that a human being can choose. </p>



<p>At the same time, some 20-somethings are getting into them thanks to the pernicious influence of TikTok. Ever hear of a &#8220;wolf cut?&#8221; It&#8217;s just a euphemism for mullets and it&#8217;s horrifying.</p>



<p>But whether Daxton&#8217;s hairstyle is fashionable or not is actually not the point. Whether his hair looks good or not is not the point, either. Which is good, because &#8220;<em>or not</em>&#8221; is winning in both categories.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="520" height="439" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/amy-duggar-on-tlc.png" alt="Amy Duggar on TLC" class="wp-image-412084" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/amy-duggar-on-tlc.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/amy-duggar-on-tlc-300x253.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/amy-duggar-on-tlc-335x283.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/12/amy-duggar-on-tlc-347x293.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Duggar appears here back in the day on TLC. She has been an outspoken critic of her famous family.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Whatever we may think of Daxton&#8217;s hair, or of Amy as a person, she is 100% right. Yes, really.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s 4 years old. It&#8217;s his hair. And it&#8217;s not harming anyone or anything.</p>



<p>If you try to control how someone manages their hair for their whole life, they&#8217;re going to go to college and buzz it off in the dorm hallways because they can finally make their own choice. That&#8217;s basically what Britney Spears did back in the day. Amy&#8217;s 100% on the money here.</p>

<p>In recent months, Amy Duggar has become something of a divisive figure among folks who enjoy discussing her controversial family.</p>



<p>There are some who credit Amy with standing up to her famous uncle and defending her long-suffering female cousins.</p>



<p>But there are others who believe that Amy has been riding her relatives&#8217; coattails and enjoying the spotlight a little bit too much.</p>



<p>The latter group has had much to complain about lately, as Amy seems intent on boosting her public profile and cashing in on her family&#8217;s notoriety.</p>

<p>Last week,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/amy-duggar-slammed-for-creating-instagram-page-for-four-year-old-son-stop-exploiting-your-kid/"> Amy created an Instagram page for her four-year-old son, Daxton</a>, and promoted it on her own account.</p>



<p>Many found the move to be in poor taste, as Amy has repeatedly spoken out about the dangers of forcing kids into the spotlight at a young age.</p>



<p>Daxton can&#8217;t possibly understand the dangers and complexities of social media, which is one reason that most platforms have strict age limits.</p>

<p></p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Amy plans to monitor the page, but it&#8217;s still a strange move.</p>



<p>Anyway, while public opinion is split on the topic of Daxton&#8217;s first foray into social media, everyone seems to be in agreement that Amy&#8217;s most recent PR move is motivated by nothing but cold hard cash.</p>



<p>And folks who have commented on it seem to feel that she didn&#8217;t really think this one through.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/181egmj/famy_in_mountain_home_ar/">post</a> on the r/DuggarsSnark subreddit, Amy has been appearing on billboards for a car dealership based in Mountain Home, Arkansas.</p>

<p>Most commenters seemed to agree that Amy&#8217;s latest business venture is at best strange and at worst inappropriate.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/josh-duggar-appeal-denied-disgraced-star-to-rot-in-jail-for-9-more-years/">Josh Duggar was operating a car dealership </a>when he was arrested on child pornography charges.</p>



<p>Obviously, Amy had no direct involvement in that scandal.</p>



<p>But still, it would probably be a good idea for all Duggars to steer clear of the world of auto sales from now until the end of time. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;A Duggar-adjacent to advertise our car business? This seems perfectly fine. Nothing ever goes wrong with Duggars at car lots. Great thinking,&#8221; one Reddit user wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right?! Like who the eff thought this was a good idea?!&#8221; another asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;This girl will really do anything except get a real job… definitely a Duggar,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Next Dax will be plastered on one,&#8221; a fourth joked.</p>



<p>&#8220;That looks like such a skeezy CARLOT, Famy is perfect for their billboard,&#8221; a fifth noted (Famy is a nickname Reddit users came up with in reference to Amy&#8217;s love for the spotlight).</p>



<p>Amy probably won&#8217;t respond to the criticism of her latest endorsement deal &#8212; but given her fondness for googling her own name, you can be certain that she&#8217;s aware of the controversy!</p>

<p>Amy Duggar has become something of a divisive figure in the Duggar-obsessed corners of the internet recent years.</p>



<p>There are those who see her as a bold crusader for truth and justice, fighting alongside her whistleblowing cousins Jill and Jinger Duggar to expose the truth about the abusive family that raised them.</p>



<p>And then there are those who think that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/amy-duggar-outta-the-way-jill-im-writing-my-own-book-and-i-am-not-gonna-go-easy-on-jim-bob/">Amy is merely an opportunist</a> who&#8217;s latched onto her cousins&#8217; coattails as she attempts to build a successful career for herself as an influencer and media figure.</p>



<p>The latter argument was bolstered this week by Amy&#8217;s baffling decision to launch an Instagram page for her four-year-old son, Daxton.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Amy announced the move in an Instagram Story posted to her own page.</p>



<p>She made sure to explain that the decision was entirely Daxton&#8217;s.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wants to start doing toy reviews and sharing our adventures,&#8221; Amy wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;So if you&#8217;d like to follow he&#8217;d love that!&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-575x1024.png" alt="An Instagram screenshot in which Amy Duggar announces that she's created an Instagram page for her son." class="wp-image-487450" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-575x1024.png 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-169x300.png 169w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-188x335.png 188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-195x347.png 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-292x520.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-360x640.png 360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-431x768.png 431w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-539x960.png 539w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM-607x1080.png 607w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-17-at-10.23.31-AM.png 646w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Duggar announced this week that she&#8217;s created an Instagram page for her four-year-old son.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The whole thing sounds innocent enough, and maybe it is.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s hard not to see the irony in Amy&#8217;s announcement.</p>



<p>After all, this is a woman who&#8217;s attempting to make a name for herself as a crusader against child exploitation.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s repeatedly bashed her Uncle Jim Bob for forcing his kids into the spotlight in order to advance his own career.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, many were quick to call Amy out for her hypocrisy.</p>



<p>Some Reddit users even went so far as to accuse the 35-year-old of exploiting Daxton.</p>



<p>&#8220;Exploiting her child, that&#8217;s the Duggar Way! Grandma Mary would be so proud,&#8221; wrote one redditor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Famy, you are not a child advocate, and pimping out your kid ala Boob is right up your alley,&#8221; another wrote.</p>



<p>(&#8220;Famy&#8221; is a derisive nickname used to mock Amy for her alleged obsession with the spotlight.)</p>



<p>&#8220;She acts like she&#8217;s so much better than [Jim Bob] and them. Maybe in other senses but at the end of the day she&#8217;s still exploiting her kid. Gross,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the response to Amy&#8217;s latest social media venture has not been overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<p></p>



<p>But either she hasn&#8217;t noticed, or she doesn&#8217;t care because Dax&#8217;s toy review page is still live.</p>



<p>Look, it&#8217;s entirely possible that Amy went into this with the best of intentions, and the initial idea was all her son&#8217;s.</p>



<p>But as many have pointed out, social media is simply not a safe place for young children, especially ones who, through no fault of their own, are associated with a number of controversies and scandals.</p>



<p>Maybe Amy should&#8217;ve just filmed Dax doing his toy reviews and then kept the footage for herself!</p>

<p>Like the rest of her infamous family, Amy Duggar has been in the news quite a lot in recent months.</p>



<p>But unlike most of the Duggars, Amy isn&#8217;t afraid to speak out against her powerful Uncle Jim Bob.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/amy-duggar-praises-jill-for-standing-up-to-jim-bob-youre-gonna-change-the-world-with-this-book/">Amy supported Jill Duggar</a> when she released her debut memoir, and she was one of only two Duggars to participate in the controversial Amazon documentary <em>Shiny Happy People.</em></p>



<p>It was an eventful summer for the mother of one, and now, fans think Amy might close out the year with a couple of major life announcements.</p>

<p>For starters, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/amy-duggar-outta-the-way-jill-im-writing-my-own-book-and-i-am-not-gonna-go-easy-on-jim-bob/">Amy has hinted that she&#8217;s working on a memoir</a> of her own.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re sure her book will depict Jim Bob in an even more unflattering light!</p>



<p>On top of that, fans are convinced that Amy is secretly pregnant with her second child.</p>



<p>The rumors stem mainly from Amy&#8217;s most recent Instagram post, a tribute to her son, four-year-old Daxton.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-1024x675.png" alt="" class="wp-image-477694" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-1024x675.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-300x198.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-768x506.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-735x485.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-335x221.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-347x229.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-520x343.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-640x422.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-960x633.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM-1080x712.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-15-at-9.23.33-AM.png 1192w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amy Duggar appears in the recent Amazon documentary series Shiny Happy People.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;My little built in bestie … you’re all I’ve ever wanted and prayed for! I love watching you learn and soak up the world around you and enjoy life!&#8221; she captioned the photo.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s such a gift and being your Mama isn’t a role I take lightly. This world is hurting right now and I do not take one single second with you for granted,&#8221; Amy continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are so loved, blessed and protected and my heart breaks for what is happening. This world is not our home.&#8221;</p>



<p>That last sentence is a little ominous, but Amy was clearly feeling a bit glum about the state of society when she posted.</p>



<p>Also, it seems that she&#8217;s held onto some of Jim Bob&#8217;s unorthodox beliefs, including the teaching that the &#8220;material world&#8221; is an illusion created by the devil.</p>



<p>Anyway, Amy&#8217;s somewhat loose-fitting outfit was enough to convince some fans that she&#8217;s hiding a baby bump.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dillon King has always been supportive of Amy Duggar. Now, he&#8217;s joining her in speaking out against Jim Bob. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;My next Duggar pregnancy prediction is Amy!&#8221; one Reddit user wrote in response to the pic.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s believable, she always hides her stomach,&#8221; another added,<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/9361123/amy-duggar-baggy-sweats-photo-pregnant-second-child/"> according to </a>UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>Others were more skeptical, with many pointing out that Amy has stated she has no desire to expand her family further.</p>



<p>&#8220;Amy said she only wanted one child. I doubt she will have another one,&#8221; one fan commented.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dax is a holy terror and being a mom seems to be a huge struggle for Amy,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no actual evidence that Amy is pregnant, and we have no reason to doubt her when she says she only wants one kid.</p>



<p>So our guess would be that she&#8217;s not expecting.</p>



<p>Still, you can be sure the rumors will persist until Amy addresses the matter directly.</p>



<p>Hey, at least it&#8217;s free publicity for her upcoming memoir!</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/jed-duggar-openly-condemns-jill-derick-memoir-dont-criticize-our-parents/">Jill Duggar published her debut memoir</a> earlier this month.</p>



<p>As expected, the book has generated quite a bit of controversy within Jill&#8217;s family, as the mother of three wrote with blunt candor about her abusive upbringing.</p>



<p>Some members of the Duggar clan have voiced harsh criticism, including Jill&#8217;s parents, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/jim-bob-and-michelle-duggar-to-jill-stop-publicly-exposing-us/">Jim Bob and Michelle, who claim the book is full of lies</a>.</p>



<p>But others have rushed to Jill&#8217;s defense, including her rebellious cousin Amy.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Amy is the daughter of Jim Bob&#8217;s sister, and she&#8217;s long been critical of her famous uncle&#8217;s bonkers belief system.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been boosting Jill&#8217;s book since the day it was released, and Jill seems mighty grateful that she has at least one outspoken supporter from her own family.</p>



<p>(For the most part, the Duggars who haven&#8217;t openly criticized the book have simply remained silent.)</p>

<p>Now, it seems that Jill&#8217;s example might have inspired Amy to pen a memoir of her own.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Amy celebrated Jill&#8217;s success once again by posting the photo below.</p>



<p>&#8220;Instant NYT BESTSELLER!!&#8221; she captioned the pic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy you should write your own book too!&#8221; one fan commented on the pic, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/9168041/amy-duggar-next-family-member-publish-book/">according to</a> UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have been contacted by publishing companies, so I just need to see if it’s the right fit,&#8221; Amy replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do believe my story could help so many people. So many conversations and situations to be told. So we shall see! Right now I’m just supporting Jill &amp; Derick!&#8221;</p>



<p>One commenter pointed out that Amy&#8217;s memoir might not be quite as scandalous as Jill&#8217;s, as her childhood wasn&#8217;t nearly as dysfunctional.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should she write one? She didn’t live in the house and she wasn’t raised with any of the same teachings,&#8221; this person observed.</p>



<p>Amy was quick to clap back at that criticism, noting that she could offer a unique perspective on the bizarre Duggar saga.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although I didn’t live at the big house I grew up all around it. I think my story would impact lives bc it wasn’t a normal childhood,&#8221; she replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;A story nobody knows and a story that’s hard to write. Then tv stuff and what I was told. It would be a juicy one,&#8221; Amy continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a book with a lot of stories because a lot has happened in my life even without the camera around,&#8221; she continued.  We all have a story to tell.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that everyone has their story &#8212; and tales of life in the Duggar family have proven to be quite popular with readers!</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Amy will have zero difficulty landing a lucrative publishing deal!</p>



<p>And you can be sure that Jim Bob is shaking in his boots just thinking about it!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/jill-duggar-opens-up-about-abusive-childhood-i-thought-cps-was-going-to-take-us-away-from-our-parents/">Jill Duggar&#8217;s highly anticipated debut memoir</a> finally hit stores.</p>



<p>As expected, the book is creating quite a stir thanks to revelations about Jill&#8217;s difficult upbringing and the abuse and neglect she endured at the hands of her parents.</p>



<p>To be clear, at no point does Jill accuse Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar of <em>physically</em> abusing their children.</p>



<p>But she confirms that the couple<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/jill-duggar-my-parents-keep-protecting-my-gross-brother-and-it-makes-me-sick/"> protected eldest son Josh Duggar after he molested four of his sisters</a>, thus enabling him to commit additional sex crimes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/jim-bob-michelle-duggar-clap-back-at-jills-claims-that-she-was-treated-worse-than-sex-offender-josh-why-are-you-lying/">Jim Bob and Michelle have already fired back at Jill</a>, claiming that their portrayal in the book is inaccurate and malicious.</p>



<p>Jill cut off contact with her folks back in 2019, and it seems she has no intention of publicly responding to their latest criticism.</p>



<p>Fortunately, she has more supporters than detractors, and one of her biggest fans came to her defense this week. </p>

<p>Amy Duggar has long been critical of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/jim-bob-duggar-all-the-wild-beliefs-and-shocking-scandals-of-reality-tvs-most-controversial-father/">Jim Bob&#8217;s bizarre belief system</a>, and she&#8217;s one of the only Duggars who has publicly supported Jill.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, she posted an Instagram tribute to Jill in celebration of her cousin&#8217;s literary debut.</p>



<p>&#8220;May God bless the people who read your heart! You are going to help so many hurting people and that’s what it’s all about,&#8221; Amy captioned the photo below.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand being cautious to trust, we’ve talked about it and it’s still so difficult given what all we’ve been through, but through it all I’m so glad God has given us strength,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve said it so many times and it’s still so true, I love how you and @derickdillard stand for truth! God goes before you both! Cheering you on all the way!&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, Amy is 100 percent Team Jill.</p>

<p>And Jill is sure to benefit from the support an enforcer who&#8217;s not afraid of a fight.</p>



<p>Obviously, Jill deserves all the credit in the world for courageously telling her story and speaking out against the cult-like environment in which she was raised.</p>



<p>But now it&#8217;s time to defend the claims made in the book, and she might be a little too close to the situation to do so effectively.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jill Duggar is preparing to publish her debut memoir.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After all, this is her immediate family whom she&#8217;s making allegations against. </p>



<p>Jill might not be willing to say what needs to be said when they inevitably clap back at her claims.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re sure <em>Amy</em> is more than willing to go toe-to-toe with her famous Uncle Jim Bob.</p>



<p>And since Amy has a book of her own coming out soon, she&#8217;s sure to benefit from the free publicity! It&#8217;s a win-win!</p>
