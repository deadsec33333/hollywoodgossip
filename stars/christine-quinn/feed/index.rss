<p>Christine Quinn has been through it.</p>



<p>And now the Selling Sunset star is at last ready to talk about it.</p>



<p>In a new interview with People Magazine, the Quinn opens up in harrowing detail about her life as the wife of Christian Dumontet, along with the reason why she filed for divorce from him last year.</p>

<p>Quinn’s estranged husband, and the father of her three-year old son, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinn-husband-arrest-domestic-violence-selling-sunset/">was arrested in connection</a> with an alleged domestic violence incident involving their child in March 2024.</p>



<p>He was later <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinns-husband-arrested-for-second-time-this-week/">arrested <em>again</em> for violating</a> an emergency protective order that Quinn says she was granted.</p>



<p>“People really don&#8217;t know this. I was hacked out of my entire life. I was stripped of my entire life overnight &#8212; I literally had nothing. And it was dehumanizing,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/christine-quinn-opens-up-about-dehumanizing-split-from-ex-christian-dumontet-exclusive-11695938">Quinn told People</a> through years. &#8220;I was completely resourceless.”</p>



<p>Afraid to be at home, the real estate expert says she either stayed in hotels for awhile or crashed on the couches of friends.</p>

<p>The headlines that went viral as a result of the couple&#8217;s split were almost incomprehensible &#8212; most notably when Quinn claimed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinn-my-husband-assaulted-me-with-urine-and-feces/">Dumontet attacked her with feces and urine</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, though, &#8220;this is something that had been going on for a while,” she told People of the serious issues she formerly had with her husband. </p>



<p>“This is something that had been under the surface for a long time. It was extremely unhealthy, and I like to think that I&#8217;m extremely resilient &#8212; and I am.”</p>



<p>In the end, as is so often the case, Quinn left her marriage for the sake of her young son.</p>

<p>“There are certain things that I could tolerate, and it got to a point where it was affecting my son, and that wasn&#8217;t okay,&#8221; she now explains. </p>



<p>I was like, ‘Okay, I can deal with this, I&#8217;m an adult.’ But bringing him into the chaos and everything that kind of ensued, I was like, ‘No, this is not okay.’”</p>



<p>Just how controlling was Dumentot, according to the Selling Sunset alum?</p>



<p>“There were times where my husband, literally, where I had to go to work and he would lay himself under my car,” she claims. “I would sit for an hour until I finally missed a meeting and gave up and would go back inside, or he would shut the gates down so I couldn&#8217;t leave. It was bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>It sounds awful.</p>



<p>Quinn has relocated to Texas with her son and says it&#8217;s a blessing to be so close to her loved ones.</p>



<p>“I am really, really grateful to be living here,” she says of her new home. &#8220;I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it&#8217;s really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.”</p>



<p>Neither Dumontet nor his lawyer did not responded to People&#8217;s requests for comment about Quinn’s allegations.</p>

<p>We have an update on the very ugly situation surrounding Christine Quinn and her estranged husband, Christian Dumontet.</p>



<p>As previously reported, the former Selling Sunset star is in the middle of what appears to be an unfortunate split from her spouse.</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinn-husband-arrest-domestic-violence-selling-sunset/">Dumontet was arrested for an alleged assault</a> against Quinn, which resulted in the couple&#8217;s three-year old son getting sent to the hospital after he reportedly threw a bag full of glass at his wife &#8212; and it hit the toddler instead.</p>



<p>Dumontet was then arrested for a second time after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinns-husband-arrested-for-second-time-this-week/">violating a restraining order Quinn had been granted</a> against him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="796" height="647" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0.png" alt="Christine Quinn on Selling Sunset" class="wp-image-496718" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0.png 796w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-300x244.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-768x624.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-735x597.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-335x272.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-347x282.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-520x423.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-1596616112-view-0-640x520.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Quinn on an episode of Selling Sunset.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to legal documents obtained by TMZ, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/27/selling-sunset-christine-quinn-files-restraining-order-husband-domestic-violence/#continued">Quinn alleges that Dumontet turned violent</a> after she tried to talk to him about the pair&#8217;s financial woes.</p>



<p>Per this TMZ article, Christine &#8220;started throwing a &#8220;bunch of decorative items at her &#8212; some of which had metal rods in them&#8221; during a dispute last week.</p>



<p>He also pulled out his penis and urinated in front of her, she says.</p>



<p>As part of this outburst, Quinn claims Dumontet hurled dog feces in her direction.</p>

<p>After things calmed down between the spouses, Quinn outlines in these papers how she made plans to leave her husband for good.</p>



<p>On March 19, however, Dumontet stormed in, saw his wife packing her things up and flipped the heck out.</p>



<p>This is when, she claims, Dumontet picked up a bag that contained glass and accidentally struck his young child with it in an attempt to assault his wife.</p>



<p>(For his part, Dumontet has denied this allegation.)</p>

<p>According to the former Selling Sunset cast member (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/christine-quinn-is-officially-done-with-selling-sunset/">Quinn left this popular Netflix series</a> in 2022), she fled the room with her son and called 911 at the time &#8230; which ultimately led to Christian&#8217;s arrest for assault with a deadly weapon. </p>



<p>Since then, Christine says she&#8217;s been staying at a hotel. </p>



<p>But she is still very scared for her well-being.</p>



<p>She cites mental health struggles and her husband&#8217;s controlling nature in these documents, as well.</p>

<p>Previously, TMZ reported that Dumontet himself filed for a restraining order against Christine, claiming her dogs relieve themselves all over the house, hence the true basis for their recent blowout.</p>



<p>He denies throwing a bag of glass at her or their son … and says Christine is simply trying to manufacture domestic violent claims against him to get an upper hand in an inevitable divorce.</p>



<p>This request for a protective order has been denied by a judge, though.</p>



<p>Quinn, meanwhile, is demanding sole physical/legal custody of her son until her and Dumontet&#8217;s issues can be settled in court.</p>

<p>Christine Quinn&#8217;s husband Christian Dumontet has been arrested for a second time.</p>



<p>The second time just this week, that is.</p>



<p>A day after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinn-husband-arrest-domestic-violence-selling-sunset/">Dumontet was taken into custody for assault</a> with a deadly weapon, he was once <em>again</em> arrested by Los Angeles Police on March 20 for returning to the family&#8217;s home &#8230; despite Quinn being granted an emergency protective order.</p>



<p>This, according to a booking log obtained by E! News and other celebrity gossip outlets.</p>

<p>The protective order was put in place after a domestic incident which took place between Dumontet and their two-year-old son Christian.</p>



<p>According to local authorities, Dumontet &#8220;threw a bag with glass [at Quinn] but missed and struck the child causing injury,&#8221; prompting the toddler to take a visit to the hospital.</p>



<p>From what we can gather, he was not seriously injured.</p>



<p>Dumontet was taken into custody on $30,000 bail after each arrest, which he paid upon release. Based on jail documents, he is scheduled to appear in court April 11.</p>

<p>Quinn, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/christine-quinn-is-officially-done-with-selling-sunset/">left the show Selling Sunset in 2022</a>, has not yet commented on the arrests or the alleged assault.</p>



<p>But her&#8221;focus is on the safety of her child and making sure they remain safe and protected,&#8221; <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1397772/christine-quinns-husband-christian-dumontet-arrested-again-after-violating-protective-order">a source tells E! News</a>, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;She has hired legal counsel and they are working on the restraining order filing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Quinn and Dumontet, meanwhile, got engaged in February 2019 and then exchanged vows later that year in a fancy ceremony featured on Selling Sunset Season 2. </p>



<p>They then welcomed their son in May 2021.</p>

<p>&#8220;I absolutely fell head over heels in love,&#8221; Dumontet said during a speech at the couple&#8217;s engagement party. </p>



<p>&#8220;We hit it off in the car. We were literally in the car and we had an instant banter, which is really special. You don&#8217;t get that too often.&#8221;</p>



<p>Quinn clearly felt the same, very quick connection felt between the spouses.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the opposite of me in every way, because I love to put myself out there,&#8221; she told Bustle in 2020. </p>



<p>&#8220;I love to be fabulous. He doesn&#8217;t care about dressing up or looking good. He doesn&#8217;t care about any of that stuff. He only cares about his work and traveling. Which I care about as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A <em>Selling Sunset</em> alum&#8217;s husband was reportedly placed under arrest after an alarming domestic incident.</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/christine-quinn-is-officially-done-with-selling-sunset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine Quinn officially parted ways with <em>Selling Sunset</em></a>.

<p>Fast forward to 2014 and the honeymoon clearly sounds like it&#8217;s over. </p>

<p>At around 2 PM on Tuesday, March 19, the LAPD responded to a call regarding a domestic dispute, apparently at Christine Quinn and her husband, Christian Richard&#8217;s home in the Hollywood Hills area.</p>



<p><em>Page Six </em>was the first to report that the alleged <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/03/20/entertainment/christine-quinns-husband-arrested-for-domestic-violence-led-out-of-home-handcuffed-and-barefoot-in-bathrobe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">domestic incident between Christine and husband Christian</a> resulted in an injury to their 2-year-old child.</p>



<p>“The suspect threw a bag containing a glass bottle at the victim, missed the victim but hit the victim’s child, causing injury,” the LAPD relayed to the outlet.</p>

<p>Christine and Christian share one child, whose name is <em>also </em>Christian. Christine welcomed him via emergency C-section. in May of 2021. The little one will turn 3 years old in May of 2024.</p>



<p>According to the statement: “The child was seen by paramedics but not transported to hospital.&#8221; Not immediately, that is.</p>



<p>A separate source informed Page Six that an ambulance later transported the 2-year-old to the emergency room. “Christine left the house and rode in the ambulance with her son,” the insider confirmed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-authorities-placed-christian-richard-under-arrest">Authorities placed Christian Richard under arrest</h2>



<p>On Tuesday afternoon, police responding to the domestic incident took <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/christine-quinn-blasts-selling-sunset-enjoy-the-fake-storylines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Selling Sunset</em> alum&#8217;s</a> husband into custody.</p>



<p>Officers handcuffed him. He was wearing a bathrobe at the time, and did not appear to be wearing shoes. Authorities held Richard on $30,000 bail, which as of Wednesday had not been placed.</p>



<p>According to the report, police charged him with assault with a deadly weapon. Hopefully, everyone is aware that throwing a glass bottle at someone &#8212; in or out of a bag &#8212; has the potential to be lethal. Especially if the bottle strikes a toddler.</p>

<p>At the time, she insisted that she was still part of the show <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/christine-quinn-im-still-on-selling-sunset-i-will-always-be-on-t/">and would &#8220;always&#8221; be on television</a>.</p>



<p>Despite her other pursuits, she has remained a popular fixture on the series.</p>



<p>But her time on <em>Selling Sunset</em> has come to an end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1342493/christine-quinn-leaving-netflixs-selling-sunset-after-5-seasons"><em>E! News</em> reports</a> that Christine Quinn will not return to Selling Sunset.</p>



<p>The decision, reports agree, was mutual. Apparently, Christine isn&#8217;t involved in any current drama or friendships, so it just made sense.</p>



<p>Netflix&#8217;s reality hit recently began production on the sixth and seventh seasons.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Christine Quinn rocks a bathing suit in this photo and shows off some of her figure to social media users.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine is of course determined to push forward with her own real estate business.</p>



<p>Alarmingly, she has spoken in the past about her interest in trading real estate using cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Christian Richard, her husband, is looking into the fashion industry.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="728" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-1024x728.png" alt="Christine Quinn Wedding Photo" class="wp-image-350796" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-1024x728.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-300x213.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-768x546.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-735x523.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-335x238.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-347x247.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-520x370.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-640x455.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-960x683.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo-1080x768.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/christine-quinn-wedding-photo.png 1150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, back in June, Christine suggested that she may make a return &#8230; as an antagonist.</p>



<p>She teased the idea of a &#8220;battle of the brokerages&#8221; one day.</p>



<p>The idea would be a rivalry between The Oppenheim Group and her own company.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I started my own brokerage a year and a half ago,&#8221; Christine noted a few months ago. </p>



<p>&#8220;My husband and I started RealOpen.com,&#8221; she announced.</p>



<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Christine explained, &#8220;it&#8217;s a platform to facilitate home sales through cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Christine Quinn is on board a private jet in this photo of the Selling Sunset star.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine then detailed: &#8220;and the seller will receive a cash transaction, so it&#8217;s like a wire.&#8221;</p>



<p>What a bold idea. What next? Trading Lululemon products for cars? (Wait, are we giving anyone ideas? Let&#8217;s hope not)</p>



<p>Though Christine&#8217;s time on the show is over, we will never forget her five seasons of drama.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>During her tenure on the Netflix series, Christine was nothing if not memorable.</p>



<p>Her penchant for drama and her whole general vibe made her a must-watch personality.</p>



<p>Some people are totally different on reality TV. But Christine&#8217;s interviews and social media activity show that she is who she is.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>A lot of people have a lot of different feelings about Christine Quinn. But you certainly can&#8217;t fault her for a lack of confidence!</figcaption></figure>



<p>With that in mind, Christine could very well make good on her promise to &#8220;always&#8221; be on television.</p>



<p>Parting ways with <em>Selling Sunset</em> doesn&#8217;t mean that she will fade into obscurity.</p>



<p>And if she does make a comeback, either as an antagonist or by rejoining the cast, many people would tune in to watch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>That is not to say that <em>Selling Sunset</em> will be bereft and unwatchable without Christine on it. It has always boasted an ensemble cast.</p>



<p>We somehow suspect that none of these chuckleheads are going to have any shortage of storylines or drama.</p>



<p>The only question is how any of them <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/chrishell-stause-can-barely-get-work-done-because-of-selling-sunset-fame/">find the time to actually sell real estate</a>. It turns out that it&#8217;s kind of hard to focus on work when your life is a spectacle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When <a href="/2021/07/chrishell-stause-and-jason-oppenheim-yup-were-dating/">Chrishell Stause and Jason Oppenheim started dating</a> back in the summer of 2021, those closest to the couple seemed to have a lot of doubts about their longevity.</p>
<p>Those fears were validated in December of last year, when <a href="/2021/12/chrishell-stause-and-jason-oppenheim-its-over-after-just-5-month/">Chrishell and Jason broke up </a>after less than six months together.</p>
<p>Now, the postmortem examination of this doomed romance continues, as other <em>Selling Sunset</em> stars sound off on a relationship that some believe was all for show.</p>
<p>The latest to speak her mind is Christine Quinn, who&#8217;s convinced that the short-lived affair was nothing but a well-timed showmance &#8230; at least for one party.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Appeaing on the <em>Call Her Daddy</em> podcast this week, Quinn explained that she felt the relationship &quot;was opportunistic,&quot; adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It was a great storyline. I think that Jason did have genuine feelings for her.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn amended her comments to note that she <em>does</em> believe Jason had genuine feelings for Chrishell &#8212; she just doesn&#8217;t believe that those feelings were reciprocated.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Christine called the relationship &quot;one-sided,&quot; noting that Chrishell seemed &quot;really uncomfortable&quot; around Jason.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the chemistry that Jason, you know, really liked her,&quot; Christine shared, &quot;and radiated towards her.&quot;</p>
<p>Chrishell insists, however, that her feelings for Jason were genuine, and that the two of them parted ways simply because she wanted kids and he didn&#8217;t.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Jason was and is my best friend,&quot; she said on Instagram at the time of the split.</p>
<p>&quot;And other than our ideas for family ultimately not being aligned, the amount of respect and love we have for each other will not change going forward.&quot;</p>
<p>These days, <a href="/2022/05/chrishell-stause-and-g-flip-make-out-in-steamy-music-video-that/">Chrishell is dating G Flip</a>, a 27-year-old non-binary Australian singer whom she appears quite smitten with.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I know this is new for you guys,&quot; she told her Instagram followers on May 10. &quot;I understand that it&#8217;s confusing, but I think it&#8217;s an act of love to understand that, if it&#8217;s not something that you know, of keeping that curiosity about life and evolving forward,&quot; Chrishell continued.</p>
<p>&quot;And I hope that you guys see that I&#8217;m the same person that you&#8217;ve been following this whole time. Like I said on the show, not a lot&#8217;s changed.&quot;</p>
<p>On last week&#8217;s <em>Selling Sunset </em>reunion show, Jason admitted that he was still devastated by the split, and he suggested that he would be open to a reconciliation.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been a few months but I&#8217;m still just going through stuff and I think there was a lot of love between us, and I still care about her very much, this has been a very difficult breakup,&quot; Oppenheim explained.</p>
<p>&quot;I can never think more highly of someone than I do Chrishell she was an amazing girlfriend, and she would be an amazing mom,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not that I think I made the wrong decision it&#8217;s just that I had a lot of respect and still have the upmost respect for Chrishell and still love her as much today. It&#8217;s difficult.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Unfortunately for Jason, it appears that Chrishell has definitively moved on.</p>
<p>And no one is under the impression that this new relationship is for show.</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s unlikely that she started dating an obscure Aussie pop singer in the hopes that it would boost her public profile.</p>

<p>It seemed like, despite her can&#8217;t-miss role on the Netflix reality series, she was parting ways with everything to go do crypto real estate stuff.</p>
<p>Not so fast, apparently.</p>
<p>Christine says that she is &quot;absolutely&quot; continuing on television in general, and will appear on Season 6 of <em>Selling Sunset</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Christine Quinn spoke to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/selling-sunsets-christine-quinn-confirms-season-6-return-details/"><em>Us Weekly</em></a>, confirming: &quot;I love the show.&quot;</p>
<p>She emphasized: &ldquo;The show is, like, my No. 1 [and] everyone knows that.&quot; Do we?</p>
<p>&quot;But we just have to get creative now,&quot; Christine claimed, &quot;because I don&rsquo;t work for the Oppenheim Group.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Maybe it&rsquo;s a battle of the brokerages,&quot; Christine claimed of what is to come.</p>
<p>She dropped the hint that viewers might see &ldquo;a really interesting dynamic&rdquo; crop up between her and all of her erstwhile coworkers.</p>
<p>Christine asserted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;Like, I&rsquo;ll always be on television,&quot; Christine vowed.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere,&quot; she reiterated. &quot;It&rsquo;s just, like, let&rsquo;s have fun with this now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christine insisted that there are no truly hard feelings between her and Jason Oppenheim.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>During the Season 5 Reunion, Jason hinted that the realty company didn&#8217;t really have space for her anymore.</p>
<p>In contrast, Christine says that &quot;We&#8217;re in a really good place&quot; these days.</p>
<p>As for the claim that Christine tried to poach a client for $5,000, she still denies any wrongdoing whatsoever.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless their hearts for trying,&rdquo; Christine said dismissively. &ldquo;But no, that absolutely did not happen.&quot;</p>
<p>She recalled: &quot;I watched the show and I was shocked. I was completely shocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so, she says that she and Jason have smoothed things over.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;He just says, you know, &lsquo;I was going off the information that I was given,&#8217;&rdquo; Christine recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;Well, I wish you would have called me,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish you would&rsquo;ve told me, you know, that you were doing this.&quot;</p>
<p>Christine continued: &quot;And I would&rsquo;ve talked anything through with you and answered any questions for you.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Christine of course plugged her cryptocurrency real estate project that she&#8217;s doing with her husband.</p>
<p>That was already a sort of laughable project among those on the internet who consider cryptocurrency an environmentally destructive equivalent of lululemon.</p>
<p>But after the recent collapse of the NFT market (finally!) and the accompanying crypto crash &#8230; it&#8217;s almost surprising that she&#8217;s not trying to walk back that endeavor.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That said, if someone wants to sell their home in exchange for the 2022 equivalent of 1998 Beanie Babies, that&#8217;s arguably their business.</p>
<p>(Up to a point &#8212; the environmental devastation and the way that some people have been scammed into gambling their life savings is kind of everyone&#8217;s business)</p>
<p>Christine is apparently there to &quot;help&quot; with such transactions using her new business. But, as she says, she will remain on the show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Christine&#8217;s not-quite-departure from the show was the talk of the town, so to speak, until Chrishell Stause shared her love story with G Flip.</p>
<p>The two have taken center stage, seeming to alternate standing in the <em>Selling Sunset</em> spotlight, for quite some time.</p>
<p>And with Christine remaining on the show, that&#8217;s likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Imagine that it&#8217;s 1999. You&#8217;re selling your house. Someone approaches you with a duffel bag of Beanie Babies as their offer. You make the sale.</p>
<p>According to some, that is the general spirit of <a href="/2022/04/christine-quinn-blasts-selling-sunset-enjoy-the-fake-storylines/">what Christine Quinn would rather do</a> than continue with the Oppenheim Group.</p>
<p>The <em>Selling Sunset</em> star has left that realty brokerage firm out of a desire to incorporate cryptocurrency into the real estate business.</p>
<p>Does this mean the end of her reality TV career?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On the season finale of Selling Sunset, Christine Quinn&#8217;s status appeared to be in limbo.</p>
<p>She had been caught (allegedly) trying to poach clients from Emma Hernan, who had replaced her for just one week while she was on maternity leave.</p>
<p>She was summoned to account for her supposed actions &#8230; but ghosted her bosses.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Now, Christine has claimed that this storyline was manufactured (at least, she has strongly implied it).</p>
<p>But she made that allegation on Twitter &#8212; as she apparently couldn&#8217;t make it to the Reunion taping for the show&#8217;s very first Reunion special.</p>
<p>Supposedly, she was sick, but &#8230; too sick to make a video call? That&#8217;s either a serious illness, or an indication that something was afoot.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Well, spoilers abound, because an inside source has confirmed to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/christine-quinn-leaves-oppenheim-group-amid-selling-sunset-drama/"><em>Us Weekly</em></a> that Christine is done with the Oppenheim Group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Christine&rsquo;s decision to leave the Oppenheim Group,&quot; the insider claims.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Christine&#8217;s bio was quietly removed from the brokerage&#8217;s site &#8212; and we just checked, so it hasn&#8217;t been restored to the site.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Apparently, this is about more than clashing with Jason and Brett about what she did or didn&#8217;t do to undercut a colleague.</p>
<p>Instead, Christine is allegedly frustrated with the Oppenheim Group&#8217;s very cautious, well-reasoned reluctance to delve into a new venture.</p>
<p>The firm isn&#8217;t using cryptocurrency, an alternative and extremely volatile speculative currency linked to numerous scams, when making deals.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of brokerages are very wary about accepting crypto because they don&rsquo;t understand the inner workings of it,&quot; Christine claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; she said, &quot;that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very difficult for agents to do these transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a common trend among those pushing for widespread cryptocurrency use of suggesting that critics (or any non-adopters) simply do not &quot;understand.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Christine said to <em>Forbes</em>: &ldquo;A) the brokers don&rsquo;t know anything about crypto; B) don&rsquo;t know how to do it; and C) don&rsquo;t understand how reliable and how safe it actually is.&quot;</p>
<p>She continued: &quot;The process that RealOpen [the company she cofounded with her husband] uses is absolutely reliable and fool-proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not foolproof, of course, is the often-changing value of cryptocurrency. Thus, the Beanie Babies analogy.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting here is that<em> Selling Sunset</em> isn&#8217;t over &#8212; the show is already greenlit for another two seasons.</p>
<p>(Weird that Netflix just canceled a slew of beloved projects, in some cases after months of poaching talented creatives, but some shows are greenlit for multiple seasons in advance)</p>
<p>Christine has exited, Chrishell has broken up with Jason, AND Mary Fitzgerald received a promotion. There&#8217;s no telling what this show&#8217;s dynamics could end up being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Over the weekend, the <a href="/2022/03/selling-sunset-sets-season-5-premiere-date-confirms-new-star-who/">new season of <em>Selling Sunset</em></a> returned to widespread social media celebration.</p>
<p>Christine Quinn of course marked the return of the Netflix reality series. She is, after all, one of its stars.</p>
<p>But Christine did more than just remind followers that the show is back.</p>
<p>She also accused the series of setting up a multitude of &quot;fake storylines.&quot; Oh no!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;30 minutes till the launch of #SellingSunset,&quot; Christine Quinn tweeted late last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoy the new season,&quot; she instructed.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Christine&#8217;s tweet concluded, &quot;all of its 5,000 fake storylines!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Those harsh words were followed by two key emojis.</p>
<p>One was a money bag emoji, the kind that cartoon robbers sling over their shoulders.</p>
<p>The other was a nail-painting emoji, almost universally used when sharing gossip or harsh truths or otherwise providing information.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Naturally, her words got people talking, as did the emoji clues.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t specify which storylines she accused of being manufactured or otherwise fake.</p>
<p>The bag of money emoji, however, strongly hinted that it had to do with finances &#8230; and reports say that this theory pans out.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/04/22/christine-quinn-calls-out-selling-sunsets-fake-storylines/"><em>Page Six</em></a> reports that there was at least one allegedly fake storyline.</p>
<p>You know that storyline where Emma Hernan accused Christine of offering a $5,000 &quot;bribe&quot; in an effort to poach one of her clients?</p>
<p>An insider claims that this was fakery.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That would certainly fit with Christine&#8217;s tweet and her emoji clues.</p>
<p>What better way to hint at a handoff using emojis than a money bag?</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s really smart about this tweet is that it&#8217;s being talked about so much that <em>Selling Sunset</em> production probably can&#8217;t complain too much.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Reality TV fakery is often blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>There are people who genuinely believe that reality TV is <em>literally </em>scripted &#8212; that writers write out the lines, that stars practice them like actors do.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funniest about these conspiracy theorists is that most of them &#8230; still watch the shows that they believed are rehearsed and staged.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In real life, though, reality TV is adjusted in three major ways: casting, production meddling, and editing.</p>
<p>Casting means finding larger-than-life personalities who will act up on camera and who have poor conflict-resolution skills.</p>
<p>Production can&#8217;t predict that a cast member will get divorced by a beloved TV star (as happened to Chrishell Stausse), so some of it&#8217;s luck, but some of it is character study.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Up next comes production meddling, most of which simply means asking the right questions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, production will ask people to repeat something (even if just because of background noise), address a topic, or speak with more energy.</p>
<p>Mostly, their job is to coax the reality stars into saying what they&#8217;re thinking anyway &#8212; the best producers barely have to be intrusive to get TV gold.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Finally, there is the editing stage, where hundreds of hours of video are trimmed down into just enough hours to make a season.</p>
<p>A lot of what is cut is boring &#8212; moments filmed just in case something interesting happens, with camera crews following the stars all day.</p>
<p>But editing can shape narratives, from erasing sympathetic moments to making it seem like someone cries every day or only discusses one topic.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Any of these (but mostly just the first two) could be responsible for an allegedly &quot;fake&quot; bribery storyline.</p>
<p>With casting, it could mean that Emma made it up. With production, it could mean that producers planted the idea. It would take some pretty fancy editing to conjure up a storyline, though.</p>
<p>If Christine&#8217;s Twitter outburst merits enough interest, she might not get into trouble for tweeting it, but she was clearly feeling strongly about this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Off screen, <a href="/2021/11/christine-quinn-i-didnt-fake-my-pregnancy-what-the-f-k-is-wrong/">Christine Quinn has had to quash disgusting rumors</a> as <em>Selling Sunset</em> casts her back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Season 4 premiered last week, introducing Emma Hernan to the cast.</p>
<p>She and Christine share unexpected history: a mutual ex, who went unnamed on the show.</p>
<p>Now, we know the name of the man who caused such a stir on the ever-dramatic Netflix series.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/who-is-peter-cornell-meet-christine-and-emmas-selling-sunset-ex/5-he-comes-from-a-prominent-real-estate-family/"><em>Us Weekly</em></a> reports that the mystery man is Peter Cornell.</p>
<p>Peter is a fellow realtor.</p>
<p>He is also the director of The Oppenheim Group&#8217;s sports and entertainment division.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Peter Cornell is a Loyola Marymoun University alum.</p>
<p>He is something of a professional legacy, because he is a third generation real estate agent.</p>
<p>Before Peter got into selling real estate, he was a professional basketball player.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Yes, professional &#8212; Peter played in the NBA with the Lakers.</p>
<p>He went on to play for multiple overseas teams.</p>
<p>After a decade spent playing the sport, Peter retired from basketball in 2009.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>For more than six years, he has been making a name for himself at the Oppenheim Group&#8217;s West Hollywood offices.</p>
<p>Peter has actually appeared on reality television before.</p>
<p>In 2015, viewers of <em>Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles</em> may have seen him on their screens.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s real estate client list includes recognizable names like Kris Humphries.</p>
<p>In fact, upon retiring from playing sports, he took up work as a player agent.</p>
<p>That role allowed him to negotiate on behalf of active players, including prominent members of the NBA.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As <em>Selling Sunset</em> viewers may recall, Christine took time off to have her baby.</p>
<p>During that time, Emma Hernan was brought onto the show.</p>
<p>Emma is new to the series, but not to The Oppenheim Group &#8212; where she has worked for years.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Emma wasn&#8217;t there to <em>replace </em>Christine, but she did take on some of her workload while she was on maternity leave.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people can be territorial about their work. It happens.</p>
<p>But Christine and Emma&#8217;s issues go back further than that.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Christine and Emma have a mutual ex, but it&#8217;s not the kind of thing that they&#8217;d bond over.</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because he was dating them both at teh same time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Apparently, several years ago, Peter was dating both Christine and Emma.</p>
<p>According to Christine, he proposed to her months before he proposed to Emma.</p>
<p>Neither woman knew about the other until they one day came face-to-face while Emma was out with Peter.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That was also how the two women met.</p>
<p>Apparently, Emma and Peter were leaving the gym when Christine showed up, having spotted them.</p>
<p>Or, as she put it, she &quot;caught&quot; them &quot;red-handed.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>At that point, Christine must have simply assumed that Peter was (allegedly) cheating on her.</p>
<p>It was only Emma&#8217;s indignant reply that he was her boyfriend that helped them both realize what had happened.</p>
<p>That sounds more awkward than we can imagine.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>There were a lot of hurt feelings involved.</p>
<p>While neither woman was at fault, it&#8217;s no surprise that there was drama.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t usually score a successful reality TV role if you&#8217;re a master of handling situations like a mature adult.</p>
