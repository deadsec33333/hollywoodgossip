										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last week, the world was plunged back into the murky waters of<em> Tiger King </em>discourse thanks to a very surprising revelation:</p>



<p>Don Lewis &#8212; the husband of Carole Baskin who disappeared in 1997 &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/carole-baskin-internet-baffled-by-reports-that-tiger-kings-first-husband-was-found-alive-in-costa-rica/">had reportedly been found alive and well in Costa Rica</a>.</p>



<p>Now, if you actually clicked on any of the articles that were circulating on Twitter, you&#8217;d find that Lewis was still missing, and that this ground had already been covered extensively in a little-seen 2021 sequel, imaginatively titled <em>Tiger King 2</em>.</p>



<p>But Baskin was a fan of the theory for the obvious reason that if Lewis is still alive, then she couldn&#8217;t have murdered him and fed him to her tigers.</p>

<p></p>



<p>That was the theory put forth by Carole&#8217;s number one rival, the Tiger King himself, Joe Exotic.</p>



<p>Exotic &#8212; whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage &#8212; is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence on murder for hire charges.</p>



<p>But the pesky matter of his incarceration didn&#8217;t prevent Joe from sounding off on the exaggerated reports of Don Lewis&#8217; aliveness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Exotic from the new Netflix Docuseries, “Tiger King” poses with one of his tigers. The show chronicles his downfall and his 21-year federal prison sentence for his murder-for-hire scheme on Carole Baskin in 2017 and for multiple violations of wildlife laws. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Don Lewis is NOT alive, I have her original diary and trust me she hated him so bad she could not kill him fast enough,” <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/joe-exotic-slams-carole-baskins-missing-husband-alive-costa-rica/">Exotic said this week</a> in an email to Radar Online.</p>



<p>“When this story came out, I said I would voluntarily move to death row if he was alive and it made world headlines,” he added.</p>



<p>“I investigated her so much I am 100% sure she, her father who is now passed away and …. killed Don Lewis and ground him up.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Exotic will likely remain in prison for the next couple of decades. But he&#8217;s still finding ways to stir up controversy on the inside. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Exotic does seem to have a point regarding Baskin&#8217;s claim that Lewis is still alive.</p>



<p>That theory seems to be based on nothing more than a discovery she made in 2002 of an undated Department of Homeland Security containing a report that Lewis had been spotted in Costa Rica.</p>



<p>The agency was never able to corroborate those claims, and subsequent investigations by the Tampa’s Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office turned up no sign of Lewis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carole Baskin is one of the stars of the Netflix documentary Tiger King. But it seems she was less than thrilled with her portrayal in the series. (Photo via Netflix)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“We know he&#8217;s not alive OK,” said Jack &#8220;Ripper&#8221; Smith a spokesperson for Lewis’ family.</p>



<p>“It’s very disturbing because the family is getting messages from people telling them, ‘Congratulations!'&#8221; Smith tells Radar. “The family is distraught.”</p>



<p>Exotic, meanwhile, claims this is all a stunt orchestrated by Baskin in the hope of raising money for her animal sanctuary.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The saga of Joe Exotic has captured the hearts of a quarantined nation. (Photo via Netflix)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Carole did not think this stunt through very well but that is what she has done for the last 22 years,” Exotic alleged in his email to the outlet.</p>



<p>“Anything she can to get in the press to raise money for her roadside zoo, which is only a front to scam money.&#8221;</p>



<p>Exotic continued to rant against Baskin, accusing her of failing to properly </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carole Baskin may have killed her husband. She denies these accusations, however. (Photo via Netflix)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“She pulled this stunt not thinking that if he was alive, she would have to give all that insurance money back and give all property to him and his daughters,” he alleged. </p>



<p>“She is who designed his will, she is the one who reported him missing, she is the one who had him legally declared dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Join us for a moment as we transport you back to March of 2020.</p>



<p>It was a time when Covid-19 was still known as &#8220;the coronavirus,&#8221; and Americans were optimistic that a two-week lockdown would be sufficient to &#8220;flatten the curve.&#8221;</p>



<p>And it was a time when millions of newly shut-in Netflix viewers became acquainted with the strange saga of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin.</p>



<p>Yes, <em>Tiger King</em> quickly became the streaming platform&#8217;s most-watched series during the first weeks of the lockdown, and the fact that we&#8217;re still talking about it nearly three years later is a testament to the cultural impact of the true crime doc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="523" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1024x523.png" alt="Carole Baskin In Tiger King" class="wp-image-344635" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-300x153.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-768x392.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-735x375.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-335x171.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-347x177.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-520x266.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-640x327.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-960x490.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1080x552.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king.png 1860w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did Carole Baskin really kill her husband and feed him to tigers? The Tiger King star says she has evidence of her innocence. (Photo via Netflix)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In case you somehow missed it (What the hell else were you doing those first weeks of the pandemic? Spending time with loved ones?!) one of <em>Tiger King</em>&#8216;s most shocking storylines involved the allegation that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/03/carole-baskin-murder-investigaton-reopened-following-tiger-king/">Baskin murdered her second husband, Don Lewis</a>.</p>



<p>As Carole&#8217;s rival, Joe Exotic, mentioned these allegations every change he got.</p>



<p>Just to add a little gruesome color to his claim, Exotic often accused Baskin of feeding Lewis&#8217; body to her tigers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Exotic will likely remain in prison for the next couple of decades. But he&#8217;s still finding ways to stir up controversy on the inside.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/joe-exotic-resentenced-tiger-king-star-to-leave-prison-how-much/">Exotic is in prison on murder for hire charges</a>, having allegedly hired a hitman to kill Baskin.</p>



<p>As for Carole, she&#8217;s at the center of a bizarre new controversy, thanks to claims that her missing husband has been found alive and well after going missing way back in 1997.</p>



<p>But has this decades-old mystery actually been solved, or is this another case of misinformation spreading like wildfire on social media?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carole Baskin may have killed her husband. She denies these accusations, however. (Photo via Netflix)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the deal:</p>



<p>A <em>Tiger King </em>sequel titled &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; <em>Tiger King 2</em> debuted in November of 2021, and to say it didn&#8217;t make quite as much of a splash as the first one would be putting it very, very mildly.</p>



<p>In fact, it seems that folks on Twitter and Reddit are just <em>now</em> catching wind of a scene involving a Homeland Security document suggesting that Don Lewis might be alive and living in Costa Rica.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I was not aware of it until <em>TK2</em> aired,” Baskin said when asked about the possibility that her husband is still alive during a recent interview.</p>



<p>Baskin long ago remarried, and she&#8217;s alleged on several occasions that Lewis was an abusive philanderer.</p>



<p>But she&#8217;s still happy about the news that he&#8217;s not dead, because &#8212; well, obviously his continued existence would be pretty iron-clad evidence that she didn&#8217;t murder him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Tiger King Star Carole Baskin On How She Is Still Taking Down Big Cat Owners | This Morning" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVEwvbWCoak?start=363&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The only problem is, the &#8220;evidence&#8221; presented by the TK2 filmmakers is almost certainly bogus.</p>



<p>The Hillsborough County Sheriff&#8217;s Office has been in charge of the investigation into Lewis&#8217; death for over 25 years, and they say there&#8217;s zero reason to believe he&#8217;s still alive.</p>



<p>Lewis has been presumed dead since 2002, and his lawyer and relatives say they still firmly believe that he&#8217;s dead.</p>



<p>Some of those people also believe Carole murdered him and fed him to her tigers, but that&#8217;s a conversation for another time &#8230;</p>

<p>But that does not mean that people have forgotten the documentary&#8217;s stars &#8230; including Carole Baskin.</p>
<p>Though Carole devotes her time, energy, and resources to rescuing big cats, some are more <a href="/2021/11/carole-baskin-does-tiger-king-season-2-solve-the-mystery-of-her/">focused on her missing husband</a>.</p>
<p>It was recently shared that Carole has no apparent interest in helping police solve that case. Why?</p>

<p>Millions of people bonded over <em>Tiger King</em> in lockdown. It was a phenomenon.</p>
<p>But that was a year and a half ago, before a series of cascading failures drove people out of lockdown and allowed the pandemic to worsen.</p>
<p><em>Tiger King 2</em> isn&#8217;t the hit that the original was, but it <em>is </em>a reminder that Carole Baskin&#8217;s husband, Don Lewis, has not been seen in decades.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Don went missing in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Since he vanished, he has not been seen in person by anyone.</p>
<p>Some <em>Tiger King</em> stars, particularly the disgraced Joe Exotic, have gleefully implied that Carole had something to do with Don&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The imagined story is a little more imaginative than your average &quot;black widow for the money&quot; story.</p>
<p>Like some twisted urban legend, the idea is that Carole murdered her husband and then fed him to her tigers.</p>
<p>While big cats are carnivores that do chew on bones in the wild, we <em>all </em>know that pigs are much more efficient for disposing of human remains.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Look, we don&#8217;t know what happened to Don, and we&#8217;re not naive enough to declare that anyone is innocent in this.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a little odd that so many people have seemed to uncritically absorb Joe Exotic&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>Joe, lest we forget, is behind bars where he belongs for a series of crimes, including attempted murder for hire and a series of charges of unspeakable animal cruelty.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In the second documentary, a Hillsborough County detective names Moises Garcia spoke on camera.</p>
<p>There, he discussed the reopened missing persons case regarding Don Lewis.</p>
<p>Moises was more than willing to give the impression that Carole is totally uninterested in cooperating with the renewed investigation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Oh? Why might that be?</p>
<p>The implication, of course, is that Carole is the alleged murderer and therefore doesn&#8217;t want to assist investigators.</p>
<p>But Carole has her own explanation.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Carole Baskin spoke to <em>TMZ </em>to explain her reluctance.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no one who has more to gain from solving the mystery of Don&#8217;s disappearance than I do,&quot; she asserted.</p>
<p>Carole explained that she is invested &quot;because it would clear my name and stop the idiotic rumors.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>So, why isn&#8217;t she helping?</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing that I know that is not either in the Sheriff&#8217;s files or in the diary I have published at SaveTheCats.org,&quot; Carole noted.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she reasoned, &quot;no way I am going to have a clearer memory or anything to add twenty-four years later.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Carole described spending hundreds of hours combing through documents.</p>
<p>She has handed over evidence to authorities.</p>
<p>Carole even offered a $100,000 reward for the discovery of Don&#8217;s location.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Meanwhile, it is alleged that the Department of Homeland Security found that Don is alive and well &#8212; living in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Carole has recently stated that she hopes that this is true.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, so do we. Frankly, these documentaries have sensationalized Carole while trying to paint a confirmed, convicted <em>monster </em>in a positive light. That has never sat right with us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Remember March of 2020, when this pandemic business was just getting started, and we were all throwing around phrases like &quot;two weeks to flatten the curve&quot;?</p>
<p>We&#8217;d say it was a simpler time, but frankly, we&#8217;re still traumatized by memories of disinfecting our groceries.</p>
<p>Anyway, amid all the paranoia and confusion of those tense weeks, millions found themselves united in a shared fascination over a felonious, bigamous Oklahoma zookeeper and his merry band of misfits.</p>
<p>Yes, despite the fact that he was locked up at the time, Joe Exotic came to his nation&#8217;s service when we needed him most.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p><em>Tiger King </em>was one of the most unexpected hits in recent memory, so it should come as no surprise that Netflix is currently attempting to recreate that success.</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s second season arrived with relatively little fanfare this week &#8212; though to be fair, the first installment didn&#8217;t have much of a promotional campaign, either.</p>
<p>Now, the tale of the great Oklahoma Tiger Wars was explored pretty thoroughly in Season 1, and the many tabloid stories about <a href="/2021/03/joe-exotic-hires-anti-carole-baskin-attorney-get-me-out-of-priso/">Exotic&#8217;s attempts to gain a presidential pardon</a> seem to have covered just about everything that happened since.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But if there ever there was a twisty, turny true crime saga that deserves a second glance, it&#8217;s this one.</p>
<p><em>Tiger King </em>Season 2 focuses largely on the rumors surrounding Exotic&#8217;s rival, Carole Baskin, and her second husband, Don Lewis.</p>
<p>As you may recall, <a href="/2021/05/carole-baskin-mystery-letter-claims-missing-husband-is-buried-un/">Lewis went missing</a> in 1997 while he and Baskin were still married.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>He was declared dead in 2002 after a five-year search failed to yield any results.</p>
<p>An additional 20 years have passed since that ruling, so we thought it was safe to assume that Lewis is well and truly dead.</p>
<p>But hold on! This wouldn&#8217;t be the Tiger King franchise without a few unexpected twists!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Season 2 features new insights from Lewis&#8217; attorney, Don Fritz, who reveals that after the first season aired, he received a call from a detective who told him &ldquo;that there were federal reports of [Lewis] alive and well in Costa Rica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little investigative work from the Tiger King filmmakers revealed that the continued existence of Fritz was mentioned in a Homeland Security report, as well.</p>
<p>It seems Lewis made numerous connections in Costa Rica while he was in the country exploring the possibility of opening a big cat sanctuary.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Several of these associates claim that Lewis discussed the possibility of faking his own death so that he might be able to leave Baskin without giving her any money.</p>
<p>Of course, even if Lewis faked his own death, there&#8217;s a good chance that he&#8217;s met his end in the years since, as he became embroiled in quite a few shady activities during his many trips to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Exotic and others have <a href="/2020/09/carole-baskin-is-there-new-evidence-that-she-had-her-husband-kil/">accused Baskin of murdering Lewis</a> and feeding him to one of her tigers, so she probably welcomes new line of inquiry into his disappearance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But aside from a few clips of <a href="/2020/09/carole-baskin-sued-for-joking-about-missing-husband-on-dancing-w/">Baskin during her time on <em>Dancing With the Stars</em></a>, you won&#8217;t see the Tiger Queen during this second iteration of the docuseries that made her famous.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because <a href="/2021/10/carole-baskin-getting-her-very-own-docuseries-ill-expose-joe-exo/">Baskin is making her own documentary</a>, which she says will clear her name and correct the many factual errors presented in Tiger King.</p>
<p>So yeah, this saga isn&#8217;t over yet.</p>
<p>But hopefully by the time of the next installment we&#8217;ll have finally put the pandemic behind us. Dare to dream, folks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Carole Baskin is perhaps the most divisive figure to arise from 2020&#8217;s <em>Tiger King</em> phenomenon.</p>
<p>When it comes to animal welfare, she&#8217;s certainly in better standing than Joe Exotic.</p>
<p>Some people like jokes about her. <a href="/videos/carole-baskin-family-of-missing-husband-airs-ad-during-dwts/">Her missing husband&#8217;s family</a> doesn&#8217;t feel that way.</p>
<p>No matter how you feel, know that she&#8217;s not going away. She&#8217;s about to tell <em>her </em>side of the story.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Carole Baskin is the CEO of Big Cat Rescue and, for a year and a half now, a controversial public figure.</p>
<p>The Netflix documentary showed a certain side of her &#8212; and of everyone involved, really.</p>
<p>Viewers of an upcoming Discovery Plus docuseries will get to see Carole&#8217;s side of things.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The two-part docuseries is titled <em>Carole Baskin&#8217;s Cage Fight</em>.</p>
<p>There, she will walk viewers through the battle for animal rights.</p>
<p>Her work and her passion is the protection of big cats.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This won&#8217;t just be about big cats in general, however.</p>
<p>Viewers will also get an inside look into Carole&#8217;s investigation into the G.W. Zoo.</p>
<p>That infamous zoo was the former property of Joe Exotic and then Jeff Lowe.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The zoo has since been awarded to Carole Baskin by the courts.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of accusations surrounding the zoo.</p>
<p>One imagines that there is a great deal to investigate &#8230; but the findings could be profoundly unsettling.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Carole may be the titular star, but she won&#8217;t be the only one.</p>
<p>Griff Garrison is a retired homicide detective. Chealsi is Joe Exotic&#8217;s niece.</p>
<p>They will join Carole and her team as they investigate the zoo.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>There have been distressing allegations of animal abuse at the zoo &#8212; beyond Joe&#8217;s exiting convictions.</p>
<p>There are also allegations of other serious crimes that some believe took place on the property.</p>
<p>There is a lot of ground to cover and there are decades of history on the property to investigate.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Carole Baskin spoke in a press release to announce the new docuseries.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a unique opportunity for audiences to come &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; with us,&quot; she teased.</p>
<p>Carole continued: &quot;for an unfiltered look at how we expose the cub petting exploiters and roadside zoos we feel are mistreating animals.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;This is our real-life work within a dangerous world,&quot; Carole continued.</p>
<p>&quot;And viewers will see it comes with our people being threatened,&quot; she shared.</p>
<p>Carole continued: &quot;guns pointed at us and the bad guys shooting at our drones.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><em>Carole Baskin&#8217;s Cage Flight</em> will premiere on November 13 on the Discovery Plus streaming platform.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certain to be constroversial.</p>
<p>But &#8230; are people interested?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>When a sequel to <em>Tiger King</em> was announced, the internet responded with collective disinterest.</p>
<p>It was a bonding thing for many people during the early weeks of pandemic lockdown.</p>
<p>To a lot of people, delving back into that world wouldn&#8217;t just be rehashing old news, it would be an unwelcome reminder of that time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="935" height="946" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king.png" alt="Carole Baskin on Tiger King" class="wp-image-344090" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king.png 935w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-297x300.png 297w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-768x777.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-735x744.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-331x335.png 331w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-343x347.png 343w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-514x520.png 514w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-633x640.png 633w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-759x768.png 759w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But this could be just different enough to draw an audience&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a sequel to <em>Tiger King</em> &#8212; this is a related show that will take a different approach to that same world.</p>
<p>Honestly, we hope that it takes a more responsible look than the original docuseries did.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But Carole is also accused of, well, being a murderer.</p>
<p>Her missing husband&#8217;s disappearance was not recent, but his family still wants answers.</p>
<p>They are sure to have a lot to say about this.</p>

<p>Since then, Jeff Lowe has repeatedly <a href="/2020/06/jeff-lowe-screw-carole-baskin-im-gonna-trash-joe-exotics-zoo-bef/">insisted that Carole Baskin killed her husband</a> decades ago.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that someone else is making the same claim.</p>
<p>Is Carole&#8217;s missing husband now buried beneath her house?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jeff Lowe claims to have received an unnerving and unsettling letter.</p>
<p>The letter, addressed only to the zoo without a name or return address, is anonymous.</p>
<p>The sender claims to know the location of Carole Baskin&#8217;s missing ex-husband.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;The corpse lies under Her House,&quot; the message writes ominously.</p>
<p>It is signed only as &quot;The Faithful Witness.&quot;</p>
<p>Under almost any other circumstances, this would look like viral marketing for some awful new <em>The Conjuring</em> spinoff.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jeff Lowe shared this with<em> <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/10/jeff-lowe-letter-indicates-carole-baskin-missing-husband-buried-under-house/">TMZ</a></em>, sharing that the letter was sent to his Tiger King Park in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It was sent to him in May of 2020.</p>
<p>The only thing that they know about this &quot;Faithful Witness&quot; was that the letter was postmarked in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Jeff and his wife, Lauren, documented their opening of the letter one year ago.</p>
<p>The envelope contained just a single sheet of paper.</p>
<p>They apparently communicated with a federal agent about the mysterious letter.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to Lauren, she also shared the information with law enforcement in Hillsborough County, Florida.</p>
<p>That, of course, is where Don Lewis went missing in 1997.</p>
<p>Like the rest of us, Jeff can only speculate over the precise allegations contained within the letter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>However, when it comes to speculation, the implied meaning of the foreboding letter seems obvious.</p>
<p>This unknown person believes that Don&#8217;s body is buried beneath Carole&#8217;s Big Cat Rescue property, which is in Tampa.</p>
<p>Presumably, the letter&#8217;s author believes that a body is buried directly beneath a house or similar building that she owns.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>You know what&#8217;s weirder?</p>
<p>Lauren says that Hillsborough County authorities made a request for the letter in May of 2020.</p>
<p>Jeff, however, refused &#8230; because <em>Tiger King 2</em> producers apparently advised him to hold onto it.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Now, filming has wrapped.</p>
<p>So now they are finally, finally sending the letter to Hillsborough County authorities.</p>
<p>Allegedly, police are planning to test it for both DNA and for fingerprints to identify the sender.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We say &quot;allegedly&quot; because at present, the Sheriff&#8217;s Office is unwilling to talk about evidence.</p>
<p>Right, that&#8217;s more of the job of documentary personalities who got their first dose of fame last year and want more.</p>
<p>Amazing to think that someone would withhold possible evidence for an entire year just to film a Netflix documentary sequel.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Interestingly, the letter coincides with a popular conspiracy theory that claims that Don is buried somewhere on Carole&#8217;s property.</p>
<p>In fact, there is one theory that specifically claims taht he is dead and buried beneath Carole&#8217;s septic tank system.</p>
<p>In August of 2020, Carole took to the internet in an effort to debunk the claim.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Carole&#8217;s current husband, Howard, is overtly dismissive of the letter that Jeff claims to have received.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just another stupid stunt by Lowe to deflect from his own legal troubles,&quot; he tells <em>TMZ</em>.</p>
<p>He then adds: &quot;Only a moron would think that an anonymous letter has any value.&quot;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Tiger King debuted on Netflix back in March, no one anticipated that it would become the top pop cultural phenomenon of 2020.</p>
<p>In fact, if we told you Americans would still be wearing masks and obsessing over Joe Exotic in September, you might have had a hard time deciding which claim is more difficult to believe.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The doc series about polygamous big cat enthusiasts is enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the moment thanks to <a href="/2020/09/carole-baskin-sued-for-joking-about-missing-husband-on-dancing-w/">Carole Baskin&#8217;s appearances on Dancing With the Stars</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Carole, all that attention has served to dredge up some old scandals that she would probably prefer to forget about.</p>
<p>As you probably remember &#8212; who could forget? &#8212; <a href="/2020/09/carole-baskin-is-there-new-evidence-that-she-had-her-husband-kil/">Baskin has been accused of killing her husband</a>, Don Lewis, and disposing of his body by feeding it to one of the tigers at her zoo.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The chief proponent of that theory is Mr. Exotic himself, and it&#8217;s kind of hard to take anything he says seriously, especially since the guy is currently serving a 19-year prison sentence on murder for hire charges.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the thing about wild conspiracy theories &#8212; just because nutjobs believe in them, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not true.</p>
<p>Sane people who have been following the situation <em>also</em> believe Baskin may have played a role in her husband&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Among them are Lewis&#8217; family, who <a href="/videos/carole-baskin-family-of-missing-husband-airs-ad-during-dwts/">took out an ad during Baskin&#8217;s first DWTS appearance</a> offering a reward for information about the missing man.</p>
<p>Naturally, Joe is loving all of this shade being thrown at his number one foe, and we suppose it was only a matter of time before he jumped in and started bashing Baskin himself.</p>
<p>Exotic is the subject of an upcoming Discovery ID special, and TMZ has <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/25/joe-exotic-rips-carole-baskin-don-lewis-missing-husband-justice-family-discovery-id-special/">obtained a portion </a>of one of the prison interviews producers conducted for the project.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;All I can say is, don&#8217;t throw stones when you live in a glass house,&quot; Joe says of Carole.</p>
<p>&quot;A dear friend of ours in Tampa, Florida is feeling the repercussions of the way she&#8217;s lived the last 20 years of her life,&quot; he continues.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m glad that Don&#8217;s family is gonna finally maybe get some answers.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>From there, Exotic suggests that he&#8217;s just one of the many people who have been brought down by Baskin&#8217;s ongoing campaign to conceal the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a travesty,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;If this can happen to me, how many other people have been tried. All of their cases need to be re-opened and re-looked at.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="523" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1024x523.png" alt="Carole Baskin In Tiger King" class="wp-image-344635" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1024x523.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-300x153.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-768x392.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1536x785.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-735x375.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-335x171.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-347x177.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-520x266.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-640x327.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-960x490.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king-1080x552.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-in-tiger-king.png 1860w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>For obvious reasons, Baskin has not responded publicly to this latest round of allegations.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;s likely realizing that her decision to compete on DWTS has led to a renewed interest in her husband&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Even if she wins, we doubt that the Mirrored Disco Ball is worth all of this grief.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Carole Baskin probably wasn&#8217;t expecting to become a household name in 2020, but once it happened, the Tiger King star took full advantage of her newfound fame.</p>
<p>These days, <a href="/2020/09/dancing-with-the-stars-fans-react-to-carole-baskin-casting-what/">Baskin is competing on Dancing With the Stars</a>, which basically means she&#8217;s sauntering around the stage in flower crowns and making tiger claw gestures at the camera to the tune of various cat-themed pop hits.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="935" height="946" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king.png" alt="Carole Baskin on Tiger King" class="wp-image-344090" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king.png 935w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-297x300.png 297w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-768x777.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-735x744.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-331x335.png 331w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-343x347.png 343w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-514x520.png 514w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-633x640.png 633w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/carole-baskin-on-tiger-king-759x768.png 759w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Carole is not a huge hit with viewers, mostly because she stretches the definitions of both &quot;dancing&quot; and &quot;star&quot; to their breaking point.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one family in particular whose contempt for Baskin matches that of Joe Exotic, who famously branded her with the nickname &quot;that b&#8211;tch.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking, of course, about the loved ones of the late Don Lewis, who was declared legally dead in 2002 after going missing five years earlier.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>During her first episode, <a href="/videos/carole-baskin-family-of-missing-husband-airs-ad-during-dwts/">Lewis&#8217; family aired an ad</a> offering $100,000 reward for information about his disappearance.</p>
<p>Now, Lewis&#8217; daughters are suing Baskin, alleging that she has been &quot;complicit with jokes&quot; about Lewis&#8217; death during her appearances on DWTS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/carole-baskin-sued-by-missing-husband-don-lewis-daughters-for-defamation-153536">According to legal documents</a> obtained by Entertainment Tonight, Baskin made offensive comments about her former husband&#8221;s disappearance &quot;when judges brought up TikTok videos inspired by her storyline in Tiger King.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The family alleges that Baskin also made jokes about Lewis during a recent Good Morning America interview, when she stated that she would&nbsp;&quot;really kill it next week&quot; alluding to the upcoming round of the dancing competition.</p>
<p>Jon Phillips, an attorney for Lewis&#8217; family, alleges that the current suit stems from a previous 1998 settlement in which Baskin paid out $50,000 after making slanderous statements about Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;These exact same false statements, and additional ones, are being made again in 2020. It is malicious,&quot; Phillips says.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Making matters worse, Howard Baskin is making these same statements publicly, as is Big Cat Rescue. As such, they have been added as Defendants.&quot;</p>
<p>Phillips also alleges that Baskin has made untrue statements about Lewis and his disappearance on her social media pages:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Carole Baskin goes on YouTube, Facebook and does blogs every single day getting out her narrative. It&#8217;s landed her on a major TV show, Dancing with the Stars,&quot; he says.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She was the featured person in all the commercials and last to dance,&quot; Phillips says.</p>
<p>&quot;All the messaging about Carole and her fame comes at their peril. There was Tiger King &#8212; and it focused on the exotic animal industry &#8212; but a lot of it was about the death and disappearance of Don Lewis,&quot; he adds.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of her contention with Joe Exotic was about whether she was involved in Don Lewis&#8217; death.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Exotic famously claimed that <a href="/2020/04/carole-baskin-i-have-proof-i-didnt-feed-my-husband-to-tigers/">Baskin fed her husband to tigers</a>, an allegation that has never been corroborated in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>While a recent 48 Hours report claimed to have <a href="/2020/09/carole-baskin-is-there-new-evidence-that-she-had-her-husband-kil/">new evidence that Baskin killed her husband</a>, it seems unlikely that she&#8217;ll ever be charged with the crime.</p>
<p>&quot;The family never really got the chance to know and years have gone by,&quot; Lewis continues.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Since Tiger King, Carole has done daily diary entries and was going to use this show as a springboard to her message. So [Lewis&#8217; family] wanted their message out there,&quot; he says of the families&#8217; decision to take out an ad.</p>
<p>&quot;They wanted, at least locally, to counter message Carole Baskin&#8217;s, in their mind, lies and fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>From there, Phillips&#8217; blasted DWTS and its producers for joking about a man&#8217;s death on network television.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Dancing with the Stars producers, you think it&#8217;s funny to say &#8216;she killed it&#8217; and to use part of that TikTok rhyme that is derogatory to Carole in in the judging, but let&#8217;s stop and realize that there is an actual death involved here and be serious and maybe somebody will come forward,&quot; he expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;If not, at least people today will be talking about Don Lewis and not just Carole Baskin.&quot;</p>
<p>Baskin has been hesitant to comment on the situation, but she did briefly remark on the Lewis family&#8217;s ad during a recent interview with ET:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I have not seen the ad. I am not at all surprised,&quot; Baskin said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s just been a huge publicity stunt on their part so what more could they possibly do than that?&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as more information becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a show of questionable judgment, <a href="/videos/dancing-with-the-stars-season-29-cast-includes-carole-baskin-chr/"><em>Dancing With The Stars</em> cast Carole Baskin</a> this year.</p>
<p>Some believe that the <em>Tiger King</em> star murdered her husband. That man&#8217;s family found a creative way to strike back.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Whether people laughed or gasped upon Carole&#8217;s casting news, there was a general air of discomfort due to the theory that she murdered her husband.</p>
<p>&quot;Discomfort&quot; doesn&#8217;t begin to describe how the family of her missing husband, Don Lewis, seems to feel.</p>
<p>They took out a 50-second ad slot during <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>. The ad, which we have included in this article, is a plea for justice.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m Gale, one of Don Lewis&#8217; daughters,&quot; the commercial begins.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a real family,&quot; she notes, acknowledging that some people easily forget that the people who appear on television have lives and loved ones.</p>
<p>&quot;And to us,&quot; Gale expresses to the camera, &quot;he was Daddy.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m Lynda, one of Don Lewis&#8217; daughters,&quot; Lynda tells the camera. &quot;And we miss our dad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m Donna,&quot; the commercial continues, &quot;I&#8217;m Don Lewis&#8217; oldest daughter.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would never have guessed that she is the eldest. Congratulations are in order &#8230; but perhaps this is not the time for that.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We need to know what happened to our father,&quot; Donna stresses.</p>
<p>Another woman, clearly not one of the siblings, then appears.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m Anne,&quot; she introduces herself, &quot;Don&#8217;s former assistant. All we&#8217;re asking is justice for Don.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Attorney John M. Phillips then appears surrounded by the four women who have spoken already.</p>
<p>&quot;Don Lewis mysteriously disappeared in 1997,&quot; he explains.</p>
<p>&quot;His family deserves answers,&quot; Phillips states. &quot;They deserve justice.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Do you know who did this?&quot; Phillips asks. &quot;Or if Carole Baskin was involved?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A $100,000 reward has been funded,&quot; Donna explains to the camera.</p>
<p>&quot;You can call the tip line,&quot; she suggests, and Phillips notes that anyone with pertinent information can also call his law office.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Many believe that <em>Tiger King</em> was extremely unfair towards Carole Baskin. Documentaries can and often do frame things however they like.</p>
<p>Others noted that anyone whose takeaway from the docuseries was focused upon theories about Carole&#8217;s missing husband and not about the appalling crimes that put Joe Exotic behind bars has skewed priorities.</p>
<p>But others, however, have assumed that Carole murdered her husband &#8212; some even imagining that she fed some of his remains to tigers.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The result of <em>Tiger King</em> has been that some act as if Carole is certainly responsible for her husband&#8217;s vanishing act.</p>
<p>For example, after she discussed concerns about the big cats that appeared in the music video for &quot;WAP,&quot; Cardi B wasn&#8217;t interested in her opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not gonna engage with Carole Baskin on that,&rdquo; Cardi replied. &ldquo;Like, that&rsquo;s just ridiculous, you know? Like, girl you killed your goddamn husband.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Law enforcement have come to believe that Don Lewis&#8217; signature on his alleged will was forged, copied from his marriage certificate.</p>
<p>His estate, to the tune of $10 million, went to Carole after he went missing in the late &#8217;90s.</p>
<p>We of course do not claim to have any special knowledge of whether or not Carole was involved in any way with Don&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>However, we can absolutely understand how painful it must have been for Lewis&#8217; family to watch Carole be treated as a minor celebrity and almost a meme this year.</p>
<p>To them, this decades-old pain remains very real, and they would like answers &#8212; whether or not they involve Carole.</p>
<p>But seeing her cast on <em>DWTS </em>not in spite of but because of her notoriety &#8230; we can more than understand why the family wanted to use that spotlight to seek justice for their father.</p>
