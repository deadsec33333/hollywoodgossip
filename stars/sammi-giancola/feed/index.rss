<p>Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola has some rather exciting news to share:</p>



<p>The Jersey Shore star is pregnant with her very first child!</p>



<p>“We’ve been keeping a little secret.. Baby May Due August 2025,&#8221; the 37-year old wrote in a joint Instagram post with fiance Justin May on February 23. </p>



<p>“After struggling through years of infertility, this is the absolute greatest blessing we could ever possibly ask for!”</p>

<p>This past September, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sammi-giancola-gets-candid-about-ivf-journey-pregnancy-hopes/">Sammi opened up about her IVF journey</a>.</p>



<p>Giancola told The New York Post at the time that she froze her eggs when she was 35 years old and had just started dating May, doing so because she was unsure about her future, yet knew she might want to have kids someday.</p>



<p>“I actually cannot believe how many people are suffering or going through similar situations as me,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/sammi-giancola-pregnant-jersey-shore-star-opens-up-about-her-ivf-journey/">Sammi also said</a> about using fertility treatments.</p>



<p>“I get DMs all the time, people are like, ‘Wow, it’s really cool that you’re going through something that I’m also going through and because you put it out there, it makes me want to now look in that direction of doing IVF.&#8217;”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sammi &quot;Sweetheart&quot; Giancola attends MTV's Jersey Shore Family Vacation NYC Premiere Party at Hard Rock Hotel New York on August 02, 2023 in New York City." class="wp-image-517139" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1588827351-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola attends MTV&#8217;s Jersey Shore Family Vacation NYC Premiere Party at Hard Rock Hotel New York on August 02, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Santiago Felipe/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Continued the MTV personality in her social media message:</p>



<p>&#8220;We are so thrilled to finally be able to share the news of our little miracle with you all! Our hearts have never been so full of love, we can’t wait to meet you baby!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alongside the announcement, Giancola posted a series of snapshot of the couple posing while holding the black-and-white ultrasound images. </p>



<p>The final picture included a teddy bear sitting underneath an umbrella at the beach, positioned next to a sign that read, “We’ve been keeping a secret. Baby May due August 2025.”</p>

<p>Giancola previously confessed on a November 2024 episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation that she suffered a miscarriage.</p>



<p>“This has been a very long process, it’s been a lot of shots, it’s been a lot of hormones,” Giancola told the camera. “Just the thought of even being pregnant was such a magical moment for me, and just to have that taken away &#8212; it’s devastating.”</p>



<p>We can only imagine. Just awful.</p>



<p>At the time, Giancola &#8212; who got engaged in May 2024 &#8212; gave a sweet shout-out to May, who she said had been so very supportive during the challenging time. </p>



<p>“He’s so positive and uplifting,” she gushed. “He’s so special to me, and I just am so thankful for him. He’s been by my side through this whole thing. I just love him.”</p>

<p>Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola has opened up about something deeply personal.</p>



<p>The MTV personality sat down this week to speak with The New York Post about her dreams of expanding her family &#8212; and how challenging it has been thus far for her and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/sammi-giancola-engaged-to-boyfriend-justin-may-after-ronnie-reunion/">fiance Justin May</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509587" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1588833062-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola attends MTV&#8217;s Jersey Shore Family Vacation NYC Premiere Party at Hard Rock Hotel New York on August 2, 2023 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Santiago Felipe/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 37-year old, who got engaged in March, told this outlet that she&#8217;s a &#8220;private person,&#8221; but also wanted to keep it &#8220;real&#8221; with fans when it comes to in-vitro fertilization treatments. </p>



<p>Sammi&#8217;s pregnancy journey will apparently  be a focus of Part 2 of Season 7 of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, which premieres on September 19.</p>



<p>“I wanted to keep it a secret because at first I was like, ‘Listen, I don’t know if the outcome is what I want it to be . . . I will be devastated if it doesn’t work,&#8217;” Giancola said to Page Six, making it clear cameras weren&#8217;t permitted inside of her doctor appointments.</p>



<p>However, viewers <em>will</em> see the reality star giving herself hormone injections &#8212; and revealing to her colleagues she’s trying to have a baby.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="705" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-1024x705.jpg" alt="Sammi Giancola photograph" class="wp-image-509597" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-300x207.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-768x529.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-2048x1411.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-960x661.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-1080x744.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1586128986-1200x827.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi Giancola visits SiriusXM at SiriusXM Studios on August 1, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Giancola has been undergoing these treatments for a long time.</p>



<p>Her ex-boyfriend, and fellow cast member, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro “was not around” during this period, Sammi explains.</p>



<p>“But it’s not weird because he is a coworker and we’re not associated with one another. He is just somebody that I work with,” Sammi said, months after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/ronnie-sammi-reunion-jersey-shore-episode-recap/">reuniting with Ronnie on camera</a>.</p>



<p>“That part of my life is completely over and long gone for a very long time now . . . And what I do in my life does not pertain to him.”</p>

<p>Giancola froze her eggs when she was 35 years old and had just started dating May, doing so because she was unsure about her future, but knew she might want to have kids someday.</p>



<p>The couple tried to conceive naturally, but have been unsuccessful in their attempts to do so.</p>



<p>But May remains strongly behind his future wife when it comes to this important journey.</p>



<p>“He is just very positive and uplifting,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/14/entertainment/jersey-shore-star-sammi-sweetheart-giancola-opens-up-about-her-ivf-journey/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">Sammi told Page Six</a>. “If I’m feeling down or if I’m going through it, he is right there to pick me up and just bring me back to a good place where I’m focused and I’m like, ‘Okay, the end goal is positive. We’re just gonna think positive.&#8217;”</p>



<p>In the end, meanwhile, this is why she is choosing to share her story:</p>



<p>“Maybe somebody can watch me and maybe understand or maybe they went through it or maybe they could just relate to me in some sort of way.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last. Allow us to recap the Ronnie and Sammi reunion episode you&#8217;ve all been waiting for! </p>



<p>Following weeks&#8217; worth of suspense and over a decade&#8217;s worth of not seeing each other, Samantha &#8220;Sammi Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro sat down in the same room on the latest episode of Jersey Shore Family Vacation.</p>



<p>The stars, as you likely recall, dated off and on <em>way</em> back when this franchise started.</p>



<p>Then&#8230; Ronnie cheated on Sammi, she left the show and recently admitted that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/sammi-sweetheart-reacts-to-filming-jersey-shore-opposite-ronnie-ortiz-magro-it-sucks/">it was gonna suck to film</a> with her ex after deciding to make a return.</p>

<p>Cut to Thursday&#8217;s installment and Ronnie meeting up with the guys in Nashville, not long after making <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/ronnie-ortiz-magro-apologizes-on-jersey-shore-breaks-everyone-down-into-a-puddle-of-tears/">tearful amends for the way he treated</a> his friends during his substance abuse period.</p>



<p>&#8220;The last two years being away was definitely a double-edged sword,&#8221; he explained in a confessional, now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/ronnie-ortiz-magro-put-me-back-on-jersey-shore-im-totally-fine-now/">he&#8217;s clean and sober</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was able to focus on myself, doing therapy, parenting classes, AA meetings, a lot of self care. </p>



<p>&#8220;But it was hard being away from my family. Now I&#8217;m ready to show my roommates I&#8217;m becoming a better person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Would Sammi care about seeing this new and improved side, however?</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little nervous to see Sam. We were together for a long time, such long history. Last time we talked it was kind of like, &#8216;We&#8217;re done,&#8217; and that&#8217;s it,&#8221; Ron added to the camera. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think we both have grown. I know I&#8217;ve grown, and I&#8217;ve matured and I&#8217;m hoping me and Sam can have a conversation. We&#8217;ll see. I don&#8217;t have a plan coming into the house … I&#8217;m here to rebuild my relationships with my roommates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Me and Sam, we don&#8217;t have to be friends, but our history&#8217;s so long, there&#8217;s going to be that instant feeling of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Sammi?</p>



<p>She labeled herself &#8220;a ball of emotions&#8221; in her own confessional and emphasized how she&#8217;s &#8220;not looking forward to spending time with this person that has not been a part of my life.&#8221; </p>



<p>Her only goal was for them to get to a place where they could &#8220;coexist,&#8221; stating: </p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where it ends. Sam and Ron is from the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>From there, the guys went over to the ladies&#8217; rental house and Ronnie gave a sitting Sammi a nod and asked how she was doing.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so cringe, I&#8217;m so embarrassed,&#8221; said Snooki of the non-exchange between the exes, as Sammi, back in her own confessional, said she was &#8220;being quiet as hell&#8221; and didn&#8217;t know &#8220;where to look&#8221; once Ronnie arrived.</p>



<p> &#8220;In my head I&#8217;m like, get me out of here,&#8221; she said, before Vinny called Ron&#8217;s arrival the most &#8220;awkward moment in Jersey Shore history.&#8221; </p>



<p>Jenni, meanwhile, compared the situation to a divorced couple spending the holidays together for the children, despite how much &#8220;they f-cking hate each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>At dinner that same night, Ronnie and Sammi sat on opposite ends of the table and everyone seemed to be having a blast.</p>



<p>But then Vinny tried to make jokes about Ronnie having been unfaithful and Sammi told him to STFU.</p>



<p>&#8220;Vinny&#8217;s really ruined it,&#8221; she later said in a confessional, toward the end of the episode. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have been cool, calm, collected about the whole Ron situation. This is something I don&#8217;t take lightly and I feel like I&#8217;m gonna explode.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aware that the date might lead some fans to assume that this was some sort of lame prank, she added, “Not an April fools joke.”</p>

<p>Of course, Ronnie&#8217;s involvement is limited these days due to addiction and legal issues, but he and Sam <em>have</em> filmed scenes together.</p>



<p>She admits the experience was a little awkward, but fortunately, it seems that the exes are in an okay place these days.</p>



<p>Sammi was previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/sammi-giancola-and-christian-bacardi-is-it-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engaged to Christian Biscardi</a>, but the couple went their separate ways in 2021.</p>

<p>Sammi was steering clear of the spotlight in those days, so very little is known about her relationship with Christian.</p>



<p>But it seems that her <em>Shore</em> co-stars think Justin is a much better fit for Sammi Sweetheart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations!!! I’m so excited for you &amp; Justin! beautiful couple,&#8221; Lauren Sorrentino wrote on Sam&#8217;s announcement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yayyyyyy!!! Congratulations,&#8221; Deena Nicole Cortese chimed in.</p>



<p>Ronnie has yet to share his thoughts on the situation &#8212; but that might be for the best. </p>

<p>We never thought we&#8217;d see the day, folks.</p>



<p>After years of bad blood, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola once again appeared on <em>Jersey Shore</em> together.</p>



<p>Yes, just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/ronnie-ortiz-magro-apologizes-on-jersey-shore-breaks-everyone-down-into-a-puddle-of-tears/">Ronnie Ortiz-Magro returned in full capacity</a> to <em>Jersey Shore Family Vacation</em> and apologized to his friends for all his past behavior, the troubled reality star was spotted filming a scene with Sammi Giancola.</p>



<p>And now we&#8217;ve seen how it all went down!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-ronnie-met-sammi">When Ronnie Met Sammi</h2>



<p>In the episode that aired on April 11, Ronnie meet up with the guys in Nashville, not long after making <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/ronnie-ortiz-magro-apologizes-on-jersey-shore-breaks-everyone-down-into-a-puddle-of-tears/">tearful amends for the way he treated</a> his friends during his substance abuse period.</p>



<p>From there, he went to the house for a dinner with the entire family, and that&#8217;s where things got <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/ronnie-and-sammi-finally-reunite-on-jersey-shore-and-its-awkward-af/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awkward AF</a> (full recap at the link).</p>

<p>Ronnie and Sammi, of course, were a romantic item for years &#8212; but after going their separate ways in 2016, the exes cut off all contact with one another.</p>



<p>Back in November, however, they were spotted by fans in Tucson, Arizona.</p>



<p>They appeared to be filming alongside the rest of the Jersey Shore crew &#8212; Mike Sorrentino and wife Lauren, Jenni Farley and Zack Carpinello, Deena Nicole Cortese and husband Chris, Angelina Pivarnick and fiancé Vinny Tortorella, Nicole Polizzi, Pauly D and Vinny Guadagnino.</p>



<p>Sammi&#8217;s boyfriend, Justin May, was also present.</p>



<p>In footage posted to TikTok, Ronnie and Sammi did not actually interact in any way.</p>

<p>But Vinny shared his own TikTok shortly thereafter in which we see Sammi and Ronnie in the same room for the first time in, well, <em>forever</em>.</p>



<p><em>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation </em>Season 6 was highlighted by the shocking return of Sammi, but we didn&#8217;t get to see her interact with Ronnie.</p>



<p>Now, the wait is almost over, and on Thursday, we&#8217;ll finally get to see what happens when Ronnie and Sam once again come face-to-face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sammi-amp-ronnie-s-long-awaited-reunion-what-went-down">Sammi &amp; Ronnie&#8217;s Long-Awaited Reunion: What Went Down?</h2>



<p>As you may recall, Ron and Sammi&#8217;s tempestuous relationship was a major source of drama during <em>Shore</em>&#8216;s early run.</p>



<p>But apparently, some of the couple&#8217;s worst fights took place <em>off</em> camera, and when the show returned to MTV, Sammi passed up millions by declining to participate.</p>



<p>Sammi has since made it clear that Ronnie was her main reason for declining to participate.</p>

<p>And now that she&#8217;s back on <em>Shore</em>, she wants the world to know that she&#8217;s doing it for the paycheck, and she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/sammi-sweetheart-reacts-to-filming-jersey-shore-opposite-ronnie-ortiz-magro-it-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still has not forgiven Ronnie</a>.</p>



<p>“I mean, nobody wants to work with an ex,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/03/entertainment/sammi-sweetheart-dishes-on-filming-jersey-shore-with-ronnie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sammi told</a> the <em>New York Post</em> ahead of the February 8 season premiere.</p>



<p>“Listen, I knew by signing up again that he is a part of this too. And, it’s kind of like, no, I don’t want to be working with this person. But at this point in my life, he doesn’t affect me and where I’m at in my own life.</p>

<p>But he fully participated in Season 7, which means he and Sammi are sure to share some scenes.</p>



<p>And things could get ugly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-did-sammi-amp-ronnie-break-up">When Did Sammi &amp; Ronnie Break Up?</h2>



<p>Sammi and Ronnie broke up several times during their seven-year relationship.</p>



<p>They went their separate ways for good in 2016, and just a few months later, Sammi started dating a YouTuber and entrepreneur named Christian Biscardi.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/06/sammi-giancola-and-christian-biscardi-called-off-their-engagemen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sammi and Christian got engaged</a>, but they eventually called the whole thing off for reasons that remain unclear.</p>

<p>Ronnie hasn&#8217;t been much luckier in the romance department.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-love-lives-now">Their Love Lives Now</h2>



<p>Sammi is dating Justin May these days, and insiders say she&#8217;s never been happier.</p>



<p>As for Ronnie &#8212; well, he&#8217;s experienced quite a few ups and downs in the relationship department in recent years.</p>



<p>Following a messy split from baby mama Jenn Harley &#8212; complete with abuse allegations from both parties &#8212; Ron started dating Saffire Matos.</p>

<p></p>



<p>These days, it looks as though Ronnie is single &#8212; and that&#8217;s probably for the best.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-episode-did-sammi-come-back-to-jersey-shore">What Episode Did Sammi Come Back to &#8216;Jersey Shore&#8217;?</h2>



<p>Sammi made her surprise return to Jersey Shore at the end of Season 6A.</p>



<p>She participated in the second half of the show&#8217;s sixth season, but at no point did she share any screen time with Ronnie, who was a sporadic presence thanks to those aforementioned personal issues.</p>



<p>But Ron has returned to full-time cast member status for Season 7, and we can only hope that he learned to control his temper during his time away.</p>

<p></p>



<p>On the most recent season of <em>Jersey Shore</em>, Ronnie touched down in Orlando to reconnect with all of his former castmates&#8230; except for Sammi, whom he still hasn&#8217;t spoken with on camera.</p>



<p>We were treated to a more in-depth conversation between Ronnie and Snooki, which focused on the former&#8217;s alcohol abuse and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-arrested-for-domestic-violence-again/">history of domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>When asked whether he was ready to &#8220;fully come back&#8221; to the show, Ronnie said he hoped to &#8212; while Snooki said she couldn&#8217;t want for &#8220;the Ron and Sam moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>She isn&#8217;t alone in that sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a great person, she&#8217;s a great woman, she was always good to me,&#8221; Ronnie said of his ex, before expressing how &#8220;happy&#8221; he was she was able to find &#8220;someone who can give her what I wasn&#8217;t ready to give her&#8221; with May. </p>



<p>&#8220;I hope we can coexist together. I was young, I was dumb. I made a lot of mistakes and that&#8217;s why I want to talk to her. I feel like I owe her an apology.&#8221;</p>



<p>Added Ronnie in a separate confessional:</p>



<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m gonna have to see Sam … looking forward to it. A lot of my actions when we were together weren&#8217;t really the best, and I could have been better to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cut from here to Snooki meeting up with the rest of the cast. Including Sammi</p>



<p>Ronnie appears to be &#8220;in a good spot,&#8221; Snooki told everyone. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s doing really good. And he said, &#8216;Eventually I have to talk to Sam.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Giancola, however, was taken aback by the remark and then made it evident she had no desire to meet up with him to hash out anything. </p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to talk. I don&#8217;t need to talk to him,&#8221; she said, concluding as follows on the topic of her sometimes-violent ex:</p>

<p>&#8220;I live my life, I&#8217;ve moved on. I&#8217;ll tell him myself, no convo needed, I&#8217;m outta here. There&#8217;s no closure that needs to be said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola returned to Jersey Shore last summer after A LONG TIME away from the camera.</p>



<p>“I needed the time to regroup and figure out my own life,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/sammi-giancola-im-back-on-jersey-shore-let-me-explain-why/">Giancola told Variety back then</a> of why she waited 11 years before making her return.</p>



<p>“I wasn’t in a good head space. I just couldn’t do the show back then. And I’m happy that I’m able to be able to come back and do it now.&#8221;</p>



<p>The thing is, Sammi was able to avoid filming any scenes in 2023 opposite ex-boyfriend Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</p>

<p>Part of the show&#8217;s original cast, Sammi was a main star from 2009 through 2012.</p>



<p>She dated Ronnie off and on for years, finally ending the relationship after Ortiz-Magro cheated on her.</p>



<p>Ronnie then took his own time away from the MTV series to focus on his own mental health, and also to battle an alcohol addiction, returning several months ago to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/ronnie-ortiz-magro-apologizes-on-jersey-shore-breaks-everyone-down-into-a-puddle-of-tears/">issue a number of emotional apologies</a>.</p>



<p>The exes will soon share the screen again for the first time in over a decade.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not ideal,&#8221; Sammi told TooFab this week of seeing Ronnie up close and personal once more. </p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to it, but I did know that if I were to come back on this show again, that this could be a possibility.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s a given. And I was like, listen, this person doesn&#8217;t affect my life anymore. So it&#8217;s kind of like just working with a co-worker.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sammi echoed this same sentiment in the aforementioned Variety interview, telling that outlet that Ronnie is now “just a guy I dated in my 20s.&#8221;</p>



<p>She says she can even laugh at this point in response to the infidelity.</p>

<p>To be clear, Sammi doesn&#8217;t expect any sort of mea culpa from Ronnie on the season ahead.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hell no! There&#8217;s nothing that needs to be said,&#8221; she told TooFab. </p>



<p>&#8220;Things were said back when we broke up. There&#8217;s nothing that needs to be said at all from his end to me, from my end to him. Like, I&#8217;m good. I don&#8217;t need closure. I&#8217;m good, we&#8217;re good.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/ronnie-ortiz-magro-put-me-back-on-jersey-shore-im-totally-fine-now/">Ronnie has claimed in the past</a> that he&#8217;s clean and sober and that his life is back on track. We very much hope this is the case, of course.</p>



<p>Either way, however, Sammi is now dating someone named Justin May&#8230; having moved on from her violent ex ages ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;Justin, I absolutely love and adore,&#8221; the reality star told E! News recently, confirming that May will appear on Jersey Shore this year and even adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gonna see a lot of him on this season, and I hope there&#8217;s wedding bells in the near future. I love him. He&#8217;s the one for me, and I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been nearly five months since we learned the shocking news:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/sammi-sweetheart-giancola-confirms-im-returning-to-jersey-shore/">Sammi Giancola is coming back to Jersey Shore</a>.</p>



<p>MTV confirmed the development in March via a Tweet that read “She’s still the sweetest bitch you’ll ever meet. @sammisweetheart #JSFamilyVacation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, however, the former cast member &#8212; known to fans and friends as &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; &#8212; is here to answer one simple question before the show returns with new episodes on August 3.</p>

<p><strong>WHY?!?</strong></p>



<p>“I needed the time to regroup and figure out my own life,” <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/jersey-shore-sammi-sweetheart-giancola-return-ronnie-ortiz-magro-1235682368/">Giancola tells Variety</a> of why she waited a full 11 years before making her return.</p>



<p>“I wasn’t in a good head space. I just couldn’t do the show back then. And I’m happy that I’m able to be able to come back and do it now.”</p>



<p>Sammi was part of the original Jersey Shore cast, starring on the smash hit reality show from 2009 through 2012.</p>

<p>She turned down the chance to appear on the revival, &#8220;Family Vacation,&#8221; when it premiered in 2018, however.</p>



<p>“I missed filming all those years. Why not come back and try it again, give it a shot, and see if I like it,” she added to Variety, admitting that she broke off contact with nearly everyone except, although not due to any issues or disagreements.</p>



<p>“I didn’t have any bad blood with anybody through the years, I was just living my own life,” she says now.</p>



<p>No bad blood? Not even with ex-boyfriend Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, with whom <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/sammi-giancola-forced-to-film-jersey-shore-scenes-with-abuser-ronnie-magro/">Sammi has already filmed a few scenes</a>?</p>

<p>“At this point, he’s just a guy I dated in my 20’s,&#8221; she said to Variety.</p>



<p>&#8220;We all go through relationships. He’s basically just a co-worker at this point.&#8221;</p>



<p>This, despite Ronnie having infamously cheated on her back in the day.</p>



<p>“I’m definitely at a point where I can laugh at it and make a joke out of it,&#8221; Sammi says.</p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of people, I feel like, go through the whole cheating thing, especially in your 20’s. Mine just so happened to be on TV&#8230; it’s just kind of funny now to look back and be like, ‘What a crazy time in my life.&#8217;”</p>

<p>These days, Sammi is dating a man named Justin May &#8212; and he&#8217;ll actually appear on episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.</p>



<p>“I’ve gone through a lot through the past years,” she emphasized to Variety. </p>



<p>“It’s been so long and whether it’s good or bad, at least everybody can see me again.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>For the most part, fans were pleasantly shocked when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/sammi-sweetheart-giancola-confirms-im-returning-to-jersey-shore/">Sammi Giancola announced that she would be returning to <em>Jersey Shore</em></a>.</p>



<p>But quite a few commenters expressed concern, and for good reason.</p>



<p>After all, Sammi didn&#8217;t stay away from the show because of some petty contract dispute.</p>



<p>No, she kept her distance because returning to the cast would have meant working alongside her abusive ex, Ronnie Magro.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Ronnie and Sam&#8217;s blowout fights were documented extensively during <em>Shore</em>&#8216;s original run. </p>



<p>It could be argued that they both behaved poorly, but Sammi appears to have left all that toxicity behind her, whereas Ronnie&#8217;s short temper is still creating a lot of problems.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/ronnie-ortiz-magro-and-saffire-matos-its-over-after-just-so-many-fights/">Magro has been arrested multiple times</a> in recent years, and at least two exes have accused him of domestic violence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="809" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-1024x809.png" alt="" class="wp-image-455280" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-1024x809.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-300x237.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-768x606.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-735x580.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-335x265.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-347x274.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-520x411.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM-640x505.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-12-at-6.00.03-AM.png 1322w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ronnie is back on Jersey Shore Family Vacation. This scene marked his first appearance since January 2022. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>He took a long hiatus from the show last season, and it was widely assumed that Ronnie had been fired from <em>Jersey Shore</em>, thus clearing the way for Sammi&#8217;s return.</p>



<p>But according to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/08/jersey-shore-ronnie-magro-ortiz-sammi-sweetheart-reunion/">new report</a> from TMZ, both exes are currently filming for the new season.</p>



<p>In keeping with the show&#8217;s family vacation theme, the entire cast is shooting in Orlando at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="557" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-in-jersey.jpg" alt="Ronnie Ortiz-Magro in Jersey" class="wp-image-404615" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-in-jersey.jpg 634w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-in-jersey-300x264.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-in-jersey-335x294.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-in-jersey-347x305.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ronnie-ortiz-magro-in-jersey-520x457.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ronnie Ortiz-Magro has a problem with his temper. This should not be a controversial statement. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>And when we say <em>the entire cast</em>, we&#8217;re including Ronnie and Sammi, both of whom were spotted at the Margaritaville Resort in Orlando on Friday.</p>



<p>The exes were not seen together, so it&#8217;s possible that they&#8217;ll only film separately.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi Giancola is finally ready to return to Jersey Shore! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We hope for Sammi&#8217;s sake that she&#8217;ll be able to participate in the new season while also keeping her distance from Ronnie.</p>



<p>Fortunately, TMZ reports that Giancola&#8217;s boyfriend joined her in Orlando, so she&#8217;s not without reinforcements.</p>



<p>Of course, the situation highlights the larger issue of MTV&#8217;s unwillingness to fire Magro despite numerous allegations of violence against women.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1004" height="969" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air.png" alt="Ronnie on Air" class="wp-image-405252" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air.png 1004w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-300x290.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-768x741.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-735x709.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-335x323.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-347x335.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-520x502.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-640x618.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/05/ronnie-on-air-960x927.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ronnie speaks here to the camera during a Jersey Shore confessional. He&#8217;s a violent individual. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/ronnie-ortiz-magro-returns-to-jersey-shore-breaks-down-over-sobriety/">Ronnie is sober now</a>, and it seems that producers are hoping that his violent past was the result of his substance abuse issues.</p>



<p>That might be the case, but there aren&#8217;t many jobs that allow employees to stick around after they&#8217;ve been accused of assault by multiple people.</p>



<p>And MTV&#8217;s failure to act is especially shameful, as one of Ronnie&#8217;s victims will now be forced to endure the trauma of working with him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ronnie Ortiz-Magro looks deadly serious in this photo, which he posted to his Instagram account. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sure, Sammi didn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to return to <em>Shore</em>, but she shouldn&#8217;t be forced to pass up millions simply because her abusive ex is standing in the way.</p>



<p>Instead, her bosses should remove said ex from the situation, but it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that that&#8217;s never gonna happen.</p>



<p>Hopefully, precautions are being taken to ensure Sammi&#8217;s safety.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Sammi Sweetheart is officially back!</p>



<p>As we reported last week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/sammi-sweetheart-giancola-confirms-im-returning-to-jersey-shore/">Sammi Giancola has joined the cast of<em> Jersey Shore Family Vacation</em></a> after initially declining to take part in the spinoff project.</p>



<p>Producers confirmed the rumors of Giancola&#8217;s return to the <em>Shore</em>-verse with a photo of the Jersey native filming in front of a green screen.</p>



<p>The pic led to speculation that Sammi had only filmed a confessional-style interview for the show and would not be interacting with the rest of the cast.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi Giancola has returned to the show that made her famous! (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Now, that rumor has been put to rest, as Sammi has been spotted hanging out with her co-stars on camera.</p>



<p>The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup has obtained<a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/03/13/exclusive-see-the-first-behind-the-scenes-photos-of-sammi-giancola-filming-for-jersey-shore-family-vacation/"> photos that show Sammi filming at a ski resort</a> in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still unclear if Sammi will star in an entire season of <em>Shore</em>, or if she&#8217;s only popping up for a few episodes.</p>



<p>But production sources have confirmed that she&#8217;ll make her first appearance later this season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi Giancola is newly single and her short-tempered ex has been fired from Jersey Shore. Does that mean she&#8217;ll be returning full-time to the show that made her famous? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to TMZ, Sammi&#8217;s return came as a total shock to her castmates, who were visibly stunned when she showed up on set.</p>



<p>For years, Giancola was adamant in her refusal to return to the franchise that made her famous.</p>



<p>Her change of heart is likely a result of the fact that her allegedly abusive ex-boyfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/the-situation-to-ronnie-you-owe-us-all-apology-if-you-wanna-return-to-jersey-shore/">Ronnie Ortiz Magro has been &#8220;fired&#8221;</a> from <em>Shore</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola shared this selfie as she lounged outdoors. The caption was just an add for a fitness-related subscription.</figcaption></figure>



<p>(Following numerous legal troubles and abuse allegations, Ronnie only appeared briefly in the show&#8217;s fifth season, and has not yet appeared on season six, which is currently airing.)</p>



<p>When she announced in 2018 that she would not take part in <em>JSFV</em>, Sammi made it clear that she wished to steer clear of &#8220;toxic situations&#8221; involving her ex.</p>



<p>But with Ronnie gone, the path is clear for a full-time Sammi return, and it seems the rest of the cast couldn&#8217;t be happier about it.</p>

<p>“Sammi was very much part of the cast and everyone was treating her like no time had passed,” one production source told The Ashley. </p>



<p>“It’s a huge deal that she is there, for the rest of the cast especially.”</p>



<p>Sammi&#8217;s castmates have been open about their desire for her to return to the show, but it seems their pleas initially fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p></p>



<p>S</p>



<p>“She blocked me!” Nicole said in an interview in 2022. </p>



<p>“I don’t know what I did! It’s unfortunate, because we would love for her to come back [and appear on ‘Jersey Shore Family Vacation.’] She’s a part of the show. I feel like it’s not whole or full unless all of us are there.”</p>



<p>“We tried to get her back like two years ago, all of us texting her saying, ‘Come for one dinner. Why not?’” Nicole said. “And she’s just always like, ‘No, I’ll never do that show again.’ We didn’t want to push it.”</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Is Sammi Giancola finally ready to return to Jersey Shore on a full-time basis? (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps all that pressure finally wore Sammi down, or maybe she just decided it&#8217;s finally time to resume cashing in on the empire she helped build.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it&#8217;s great to have her back!</p>

<p>The rumor has become an exciting reality.</p>



<p>On Saturday, MTV confirmed that Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola will return to the franchise that made her famous, more than 10 years after departing Jersey Shore.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s still the sweetest bitch you&#8217;ll ever meet,&#8221; the official series account wrote on March 11 along with a camera emoji. </p>



<p>&#8220;@sammisweetheart #JSFamilyVacation.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>A day later?</p>



<p>“OK, I can finally say … I’m backkkk!” the 35-year old herself captioned an Instagram selfie post &#8230; while tagging the official Jersey Shore Instagram account.</p>



<p>Sammi was part of the original incarnation of Jersey Shore on MTV from 2009 to 2012, but then she opted out of appearing in the sequel series, which premiered in 2018. </p>



<p>At the time, she took to Instagram to say she was enjoying her life free of the cameras and wanted &#8220;to avoid potentially toxic situations.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was largely known back in her small screen heyday for being involved in a roller coaster romance with co-star Ronnie.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>According to one of Sammi&#8217;s cast members last year, many of her friends had been working hard to bring her back to the beloved program.</p>



<p>&#8220;We tried to get her back like two years ago, all of us texting her saying, ‘Come for one dinner. Why not?'&#8221; Nicole &#8220;Snooki&#8221; Polizzi told E! News in September 2022. </p>



<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s just always like, ‘No, I&#8217;ll never do that show again.&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to push it.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I have chosen not to join the show this season because I am at a completely different place in my life right now focusing on my businesses and relationship,” the New Jersey native wrote via Instagram in March 2018. </p>



<p>“I am not the same person as I was when I was 22. </p>



<p>&#8220;At 31, I am currently extremely happy in every aspect of my life and want to avoid potentially TOXIC SITUATIONS.”</p>



<p> Sammi didn&#8217;t refer specifically to Ronnie at the time, but most observers assumed she was citing their challenging relationship via this message.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sammi &#8220;Sweetheart&#8221; Giancola shared this selfie as she lounged outdoors. The caption was just an add for a fitness-related subscription.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been 10 years,&#8221; Snooki added in September when asked about the trauma of Ronnie&#8217;s behavior on Sammi.</p>



<p>&#8220;At some point, you&#8217;re both moved on. Just come have fun. Come back to the show that was our life. I mean, we&#8217;re still doing it.&#8221;</p>



<p>What made Sammi come around and seemingly see things from this vantage point?</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say at the moment.</p>





<p>She previously expressed how much she was enjoying a drama-free life away from the spotlight.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am currently extremely happy in every aspect of my life and want to avoid potentially toxic situations,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram back in March 2018. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was a difficult decision as I love my roomies. I&#8217;ve decided to focus on me, my future and what truly makes me happy.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation airs Thursday nights at 8/7c on MTV.</strong></p>
