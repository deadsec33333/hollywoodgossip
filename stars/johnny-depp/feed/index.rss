<p>In a baffling PR misstep, Johnny Depp has likened his situation to that of the late <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/oj-simpson/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">O.J. Simpson</a>.</p>



<p>The comparison comes as Depp mounts a comeback campaign that he hopes will restore his career to its former glory.</p>



<p>Of course, drawing parallels between himself and one of the most notorious figures in modern American history probably wasn&#8217;t the savviest move at this juncture.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2181225878-1024x683.jpg" alt='Johnny Depp attends the "ModÃ¬ â Three Days On The Wing Of Madness" red carpet during the 19th Rome Film Festival at Auditorium Parco Della Musica on October 26, 2024 in Rome, Italy.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-johnny-s-career-resurgence">Johnny&#8217;s Career Resurgence</h2>



<p>Depp is currently attending the Rome Film Festival, where his new film <em>Modi: Three Days on the Wing of Madness</em> is in competition.</p>



<p>And it was revealed this week that he&#8217;s signed on to star in <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/johnny-depp-penelope-cruz-to-star-day-drinker-lionsgate-1236160403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Day Drinker</a></em>, an action comedy in which he&#8217;ll costar with Penelope Cruz.</p>



<p>All of this positive coverage must be a welcome change of pace for Depp following the controversies of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/amber-heard-announces-decision-to-settle-johnny-depp-case-actress-blasts-us-legal-system-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Herard trial</a>.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s a little strange that he decided to shoot himself in the foot by mentioning O.J.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-johnny-depp-s-o-j-simpson-remarks-baffle-fans">Johnny Depp&#8217;s O.J. Simpson Remarks Baffle Fans</h2>



<p>Speaking with <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/johnny-depp-modi-past-amber-heard-1236046019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>, Depp revealed that he finds solace in his craft. Then, for reasons no one will ever understand, he brought up O.J.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is also helpful in certain instances, especially when things are crumbling all around,&#8221; the actor explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s weird to be able to escape, not into a character, but it is good to be able to inhabit a character, and as everything is in your toolbox &#8211; some of that stuff can be used as available stimulus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is great. So yeah. Everything has been… it has really, it just is. And on some level, it is gonna be around, that kind of thing. It’s like OJ or something. But hey, it just happened. That’s all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Look, we&#8217;ve all been there. You&#8217;re having a conversation about an exciting new project; things are going smoothly.</p>



<p>And then you screw everything up by tossing out the name of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/o-j-simpsons-last-words-before-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently deceased football legend/accused murderer</a>. Happens to the best of us!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-johnny-s-new-chapter">Johnny&#8217;s New Chapter</h2>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Depp revealed that he&#8217;s moved on from the trial and is ready to turn over a new leaf, with his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/johnny-depps-new-girlfriend-is-a-28-year-old-russian-model-meet-yulia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new girlfriend</a> and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/johnny-depp-flaunts-new-teeth-after-going-viral-for-disastrous-dental-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new teeth</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly, I can sit here this very second and think about all the hit pieces, and how everybody was against me, and yeah yeah yeah he is off the map … endless stuff. I can remember it all,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Went through it all. Some of it was not the most beautiful time, some of it was hilarious. Some of it was mad,&#8221; Depp added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The thing is, it simply just was, and it simply just is. So, for me, it happened. I learned, man. Everything that we experience, whether you’re given a snow cone or walking your dog, you learn something somewhere along the way. So I don’t have any ill feelings toward anyone.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not sure if we follow the snow cone part. But at least it makes more sense than the O.J. comparison!</p>

<p>Johnny Depp is showing off a new set of pearly whites one year after photos of his &#8220;rotting&#8221; teeth went viral.</p>



<p>Yes, most media coverage of Depp hasn&#8217;t exactly been flattering in recent years.</p>



<p>But unlike the fallout from his messy <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/amber-heard-announces-decision-to-settle-johnny-depp-case-actress-blasts-us-legal-system-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trial against ex-wife Amber Heard</a>, in this case, the<em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-6-johnny-depp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em> star was able to slap some veneers over the problem and call it a day.</p>

<p><br>&#8220;Seeing that pic of Johnny Depp’s teeth on my [timeline] just ruined my mood. That’s enough Twitter for me,&#8221; a fourth chimed in.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/johnny-depp-was-cleaned-up-by-makeover-experts-ahead-of-cannes-comeback-but-critics-are-still-repulsed-by-his-rotting-teeth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depp doesn&#8217;t appear in public</a> nearly as often as he used to, so the matter of his teeth was largely forgotten after Cannes.</p>



<p>This week, however, the issue resurfaced thanks to an unexpected Instagram post.</p>

<p>As you can see Depp was in his natural habitat recently (a bar in the Bahamas). And an Instagram video posted by a local bartender showed the star sporting some new and improved chompers.</p>



<p>“Am I right too [sic] see that his teeth are looking brighter than ever before???” wrote one commenter.</p>



<p> “Is it [me] or does [sic] his teeth look more straight?” another asked.</p>



<p>“Def got his teeth done! Looks so good,&#8221; a third remarked.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-caused-the-damage-to-depp-s-teeth">What Caused the Damage to Depp&#8217;s Teeth?</h2>



<p>So Depp seems to have gotten his teeth fixed. But what went wrong with them in the first place?</p>



<p>“He has wear, which has been a cumulative effect over a lifetime,” celebrity dentist Dr. Apa recently told Page Six.</p>



<p>“Wear like that — sometimes we see it in 30-year-olds in really aggressive cases, and sometimes we see it in cases like Depp.”</p>



<p>The dentist went on to speculate that the staining on Depp&#8217;s teeth was probably a result of the actor&#8217;s known penchant for cigarettes, coffee, and red wine.</p>



<p>Depp&#8217;s had trouble with his teeth for quite some time, and he discussed the issue candidly in a 1995 interview with <em><a href="http://interview.johnnydepp-zone2.com/1995_02Premiere.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Premiere</a></em> magazine.</p>

<p>“I’ve got loads of cavities. I had a root canal done eight years ago that’s unfinished. It’s like a rotten little stub,&#8221; Depp said at the time.</p>



<p>“It’s like when the Indians would make something beaded, they would always put imperfections on it,” he  added. “I’m proud of these.”</p>



<p>Thankfully, it sounds like Johnny has now fixed the problem, possibly with a set of Depp dentures.</p>



<p>The rest of his public image might not be so easy to remedy. But hey &#8212; slow progress is better than no progress!</p>

<p>Johnny Depp, 61, has a new girlfriend.</p>



<p>And based on the age gap, it seems the controversial star is taking a page from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/leonardo-dicaprio-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Book of DiCaprio</a>!</p>



<p>According to a new report from<em> <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/15/entertainment/johnny-depp-61-dating-russian-beautician-yulia-vlasova-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>,</em> Depp is dating a 28-year-old model named Yulia Vlasova.</p>

<p>And apparently, this fling has been going on for quite some time.</p>



<p>One insider tells the outlet that Johnny and Yulia have been seeing each other “here and there” over the past “few years,” but that the relationship is “nothing serious.”</p>



<p>Despite the length of their affair, the source says, Johnny and Yulia have been keeping it “very casual.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to intel from the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13629355/Johnny-Depp-new-girlfriend-blonde-Russian-model-Yulia-Vlasova.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, Yulia is a Russian model and beautician.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the <em>Mail</em> reports that Yulia also trained at Russia&#8217;s &#8220;leading academy for diplomats and spies.&#8221;</p>



<p>The outlet reports that the couple was first spotted together at a performance by Depp and the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/jeff-beck-legendary-guitarist-and-musician-dead-at-78/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late music legend Jeff Beck</a> in July of 2022.</p>



<p>That would&#8217;ve been less than two months after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/amber-heard-announces-decision-to-settle-johnny-depp-case-actress-blasts-us-legal-system-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depp won his defamation suit against ex-wife Amber Heard</a>.</p>

Whitby/Getty Images for The Red Sea International Film Festival)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Johnny and Yulia were spotted together several times in the months that followed.</p>



<p>But until this week, it was not clear that they were actually dating &#8212; albeit, dating &#8220;casually.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the <em>Mail</em>, Yulia has referenced her relationship with Depp on social media. But on each occasion the post was rather promptly deleted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-serious-is-johnny-and-yulia-s-relationship">How Serious Is Johnny and Yulia&#8217;s Relationship?</h2>



<p>It seems like Johnny and Yulia might have different ideas about how quickly this relationship should proceed.</p>



<p>As the <em>Mail</em> reports, earlier this year, she was asked by a fan to name her favorite actor.</p>



<p>She responded with a photo of what appeared to be her hand resting on Depp&#8217;s.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1490945319-1024x684.jpg" alt='Johnny Depp attends the "Jeanne Du Barry" press conference at the 76th annual Cannes film festival at Palais des Festivals on May 17, 2023 in Cannes, France.

<p>“JD. He is a man who is incredibly talented and inspiring,” she captioned the pic.</p>



<p>So yeah, it seems like Depp is in favor of keeping this situation on the down-low for a little while longer. And we suppose that&#8217;s not surprising.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/johnny-depp-receives-standing-ovation-at-cannes-festival-victims-rights-advocates-call-his-comeback-a-slap-in-the-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depp-Heard trial</a> was one of the biggest celebrity scandals of the century.</p>



<p>And Depp&#8217;s career might never fully recover &#8212; meaning this is not the ideal time to reveal that he&#8217;s dating a woman less than half his age.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/johnny-depp-receives-standing-ovation-at-cannes-festival-victims-rights-advocates-call-his-comeback-a-slap-in-the-face/">Johnny Depp walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival </a>last week, the formerly beloved screen legend was greeted with the sort of ambivalence that fest-goers usually reserve for the most experimental arthouse fare.</p>



<p>Depp, of course, has become an increasingly divisive figure in recent years, and while he still has many supporters, his attempt at a career comeback might be DOA thanks to stiff opposition from victims&#8217; rights groups.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/johnny-depp-claps-back-at-amber-heard-i-shouldve-sued-you-for-even-more/">Depp won his defamation case against Amber Heard</a> last year, the trial featured shocking allegations of abuse from both parties, and many observers were left with the impression that Johnny&#8217;s reputation was beyond saving.</p>



<p>And indeed, a less successful star &#8212; especially one who&#8217;s pushing 60, as Depp is &#8212; would almost certainly not be granted a second chance.</p>

<p></p>



<p>But Depp made <em>a lot </em>of money for a lot of high-powered people over the years, and just as importantly, he accumulated a wealth of artistic cred with decades of risky roles.</p>



<p>And so, after his disastrous 2022, Depp was cast as Louis XV in a French-language period piece from controversial director Maïwenn.</p>



<p>And before his return to the red carpet, Johnny&#8217;s glam team pulled out all the stops.</p>

<p>“He was cleaned up,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/05/23/johnny-depp-was-given-a-makeover-for-cannes-red-carpet/">a source</a> close to the situation tells Page Six.</p>



<p>Depp&#8217;s approach to personal hygiene is famously lax, but insiders say that wasn&#8217;t the case in Cannes, where he was worked on daily by a team of &#8220;highly paid professionals&#8221; led by his longtime stylist Samantha McMillen.</p>



<p>McMillen has a long list of celeb clients that includes Brie Larson, a Cannes juror who reportedly objected to Depp&#8217;s involvement with this year&#8217;s festival.</p>

<p></p>



<p>There&#8217;s been no word on whether Larson will continue to work with McMillen in the wake of news that she&#8217;s helping Depp rehab his image.</p>



<p>For the most part, that effort seems to be working.</p>



<p>Depp received a seven-minute standing ovation at Cannes, and he recently signed a $20 million endorsement deal with Dior.</p>

<p></p>



<p>On social media, however, Depp&#8217;s comeback received less of a warm welcome, as many zeroed in on signs of the actor&#8217;s neglectful attitude toward health and hygiene.</p>



<p>“Johnny Depp’s teeth are literally ROTTING,” one fan tweeted alongside pice of the actor.</p>



<p>“Johnny Depp’s new movie, #JeanneDuBarry, debuts with a metacritic score of 51, an F rating,” another chimed in, adding:</p>



<p>“The score is currently as yellow as his teeth. Congratulations!”</p>

<p></p>



<p>“Why do i have to see closeup pics of johnny depp’s teeth against my will,” a third asked.</p>



<p>“johnny depp just looks like someone grabbed his teeth and painted them black,&#8221; a fourth chimed in, while a fifth remarked:</p>



<p>“Seeing that pic of Johnny Depp’s teeth on my tl just ruined my mood. That’s enough Twitter for me.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Needless to say, it sounds like Depp&#8217;s screen idol days might be behind him.</p>



<p>Critics may be upset that he&#8217;s experiencing any sort of comeback at all &#8212; but they can take solace in the fact that the embattled star is unlikely to pop up in any more Hollywood blockbusters.</p>

<p>This time last year, millions of Americans were consumed by the never-ending drama surrounding one of the most shocking celebrity trials of all time.</p>



<p>As you probably recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/johnny-depp-claps-back-at-amber-heard-i-shouldve-sued-you-for-even-more/">Johnny Depp successfully sued his ex-wife Amber Heard</a> for defamation, alleging that the actress cost him millions when she referred to herself as a survivor of domestic abuse in a 2018 op-ed piece for the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>



<p>The trial included countless shocking allegations of abusive behavior from both parties, and it seemed that despite the outcome, Depp had only damaged his career further by filing suit against Heard.</p>



<p>But surprisingly, the once-beloved screen icon was soon back to work.</p>

<p>Immediately after the trial concluded, Depp joined guitarist Jeff Beck as part of the backing band for what would turn out to be the rock legend&#8217;s final world tour.</p>



<p>And now, Depp might be in the early stages of a cinematic comeback, thanks to a second chance offered by filmmaker who&#8217;s far removed from Hollywood.</p>



<p>Controversial French actress and director Maïwenn has cast Depp her Louis XV in her new historical drama, <em>Jeanne du Barry</em>, which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday night.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Multiple outlets have reported that Depp was greeted with rapturous praise on the red carpet, and the film received a seven-minute standing ovation after it concluded.</p>



<p>But not everyone was thrilled with Depp&#8217;s return to the silver screen.</p>



<p>On social media, victims&#8217; rights advocates used the hashtag #CannesYouNot to protest Depp&#8217;s warm reception at the iconic French festival.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The Depp v. Heard trial became the vehicle through which the backlash against the #MeToo movement went viral. Hollywood industries seem to be riding that backlash to return to the status quo,&#8221; one protestor told Variety. </p>



<p>&#8220;To open your festival with Johnny Depp? To be frank, it feels like a slap in the face.&#8221;</p>



<p>Actress Brie Larson, who is one of the judges at this year&#8217;s festival, refused to comment on whether or not she planned to see Depp&#8217;s film.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-462018" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Johnny Depp&#8217;s reputation is not what it used to be.

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see, I guess, if I will see it,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t know how I’ll feel about it if I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>As for Depp&#8217;s performance as Louis XV, critics seem to be divided.</p>



<p>&#8220;His performance isn’t bad, and neither is Maïwenn&#8217;s in the lead role. But the two of them, like the movie, rarely get our pulse racing,&#8221; wrote Jordan Mintzer of <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-683x1024.jpg" alt="Johnny Depp Red Carpet Image" class="wp-image-282064" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/johnny-depp-red-carpet-image-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Johnny Depp appeared to be tipsy at the London premiere of Murder on the Orient Express in 2017.

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;His French is not too shabby, but his regal gravitas is nonexistent, and he only truly looks at home in the role during occasional bouts of clowning, which hardly help sell his casting as an inspired choice,&#8221; added <em>The Telegraph</em>&#8216;s Robbie Collin. </p>



<p>&#8220;It would be a stretch to say this feels like the first spark of a glorious comeback.&#8221;</p>



<p>A French-language period piece probably won&#8217;t be the project to reignite Depp&#8217;s sputtering career.</p>



<p>But the film serves as a reminder that despite his long record of appalling behavior, Depp will probably never have trouble finding work.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been six months since a Virginia jury <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/johnny-depp-wins-lawsuit-against-amber-heard-actor-is-awarded-10/">ruled in favor of Johnny Depp </a>in his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard.</p>



<p>At the time, Heard vowed to appeal the decision, but now, the actress has given up that fight.</p>



<p>In a surprising move, Heard announced on Instagram today that she has decided to settle the case and will no longer seek a second trial.</p>



<p>The actress explained that her actions should in no way be construed as a concession or an admission of wrongoing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back in the news. And once again, the drama between the exes is very messy.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;It is important for me to say I never chose this,&#8221; Heard wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;I defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heard has stated on several occasions that she feels as though all these years of legal wrangling have enabled Depp to continue controlling her life well after their marriage came to an end.</p>

<p>She explained to fans &#8212; some of whom may be disappointed by her capitulation &#8212; that she made this move to protect both her mental health and her freedom to speak her mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now I finally have an opportunity to emancipate myself from something I attempted to leave over six years ago and on terms I can agree to,&#8221; Heard wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have made no admission. This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>From there, Heard blasted the American legal system and reminded her followers that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/amber-heard-confesses-love-for-johnny-depp-ahead-of-new-court-ba/">Depp previously lost a similar defamation suit</a> in the UK.</p>



<p>&#8220;I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder,&#8221; Amber wrote.</p>



<p>She concluded by revealing that she plans to continue to tell her story and to help other abuse victims find justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;In settling this case,&#8221; Heard wrote, &#8220;I am choosing the freedom to dedicate my time to the work that helped me heal after my divorce; work that exists in realms in which I feel seen, heard and believed, and which I know I can effect change.&#8221;</p>



<p>While Depp has not personally responded to his ex-wife&#8217;s decision, his lawyers issued a statement in the wake of Heard&#8217;s announcement.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are pleased to formally close the door on this painful chapter for Mr. Depp, who made clear throughout this process that his priority was about bringing the truth to light,&#8221; Benjamin Chew and Camille Vasquez told Yahoo News.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The jury&#8217;s unanimous decision and the resulting judgement in Mr. Depp&#8217;s favor against Ms. Heard remain fully in place,&#8221; the legal team continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;The payment of $1M — which Mr. Depp is pledging and will donate to charities — reinforces Ms. Heard&#8217;s acknowledgement of the conclusion of the legal system&#8217;s rigorous pursuit for justice.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as more information becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Folks, we regret to inform you that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/johnny-depps-erectile-dysfunction-led-to-sexual-assault-amber-heard-claims/">the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial</a> is back in the news.</p>



<p>Yes, the case was decided way back in June, but as you may recall, the jury&#8217;s decision wasn&#8217;t as conclusive as some observers had hoped.</p>



<p>By any measure Depp &#8220;won&#8221; the trial, being awarded $10.35 million in damages based on the jury&#8217;s conclusion that Heard had defamed him and done irreparable damage to his career.</p>



<p>Why, then, is Johnny appealing the verdict?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back in the news. And once again, the drama between the exes is very messy.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Well, the jury also decided that Heard should be awarded $2 million, having been defamed by Depp&#8217;s attorney, Adam Waldman.</p>



<p>Even though Depp came out on top by more than $8 million, in an act whose pettiness is matched only by its hubris, he&#8217;s now dragging Heard back to court on the belief that he shouldn&#8217;t be forced to pay her a dime.</p>



<p>The jury&#8217;s decision was based on comments that Waldman made in an interview, in which he described the fight that allegedly ended Depp and Heard&#8217;s marriage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Depp v Heard" class="wp-image-445931" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/depp-v-heard-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Amber Heard takes the stand for a round of cross-examination by Johnny Depp&#8217;s attorneys.

<p>Heard lawyers claimed Depp was &#8220;vicariously liable&#8221; for these statements.</p>



<p>&#8220;So Amber and her friends spilled a little wine and roughed the place up, got their stories straight under the direction of a lawyer and publicist, and then placed a second call to 911,&#8221; Waldman said at the time.</p>



<p>According to court documents filed this week, Depp&#8217;s attorneys believe that the court &#8220;should reverse the judgment on Ms. Heard&#8217;s counterclaim,&#8221; even though they&#8217;re in favor of every other aspect of the verdict.</p>



<p>&#8220;The jury’s emphatic favorable verdict on all three defamatory statements alleged in his complaint fully vindicated Mr. Depp and restored his reputation,&#8221; reads the filing.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;However, the trial court was confronted with a number of novel and complex legal and factual issues, and although the trial court decided the vast majority of those issues sensibly and correctly, a few rulings were erroneous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Depp&#8217;s attorneys also argue that Waldman was retained as an independent contractor, and thus had no right to speak on Depp&#8217;s behalf.</p>



<p>They further allege that there&#8217;s no evidence of &#8220;actual malice&#8221; in his statement, which is one of the conditions for libel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="696" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-1024x696.jpg" alt="Johnny Depp Enters Court" class="wp-image-446322" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-1024x696.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-768x522.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-1536x1044.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-735x500.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-335x228.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-347x236.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-520x353.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-640x435.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1-1080x734.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/johnny-depp-enters-court-1.jpg 1932w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Johnny Depp greets the crowd outside a Virginia courthouse.

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;No evidence of Mr. Waldman&#8217;s actual malice was presented at trial, so the judgment against Mr. Depp cannot be sustained,&#8221; Depp&#8217;s lawyers write.</p>



<p>They go on to argue that Waldman&#8217;s words were a &#8220;non-actionable statement of opinion insufficient to support a claim of defamation.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a lot of legalese to say &#8220;Depp wants to go nuclear, and he won&#8217;t sleep as long as Heard has a dime to her name.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-1024x683.jpg" alt="Amber Heard at Trial" class="wp-image-446663" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/amber-heard-at-trial-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Amber Heard takes the stand for the last for the final time in her trial against Johnny Depp. The actress was grilled by Depp attorney Camille Vasquez during cross-examination.

<p>Of course, Heard is also appealing the verdict, so even if Depp&#8217;s appeal is rejected, there remains a very strong chance that these two will wind up back in court.</p>



<p>Already, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/03/johnny-depp-denied-appeal-in-amber-heard-wife-beater-case/">Heard&#8217;s first request for a new trial</a> was thrown out by the judge.</p>



<p>The actress alleged that one of the jurors in the original trial had served on a fraudulent basis, having answered a summons that was intended for someone else.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-462018" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1432988502-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Johnny Depp&#8217;s reputation is not what it used to be.

<p></p>



<p>The judge wasn&#8217;t buying it, and Amber&#8217;s attorneys went back to the drawing board.</p>



<p>So yeah &#8212; you might have thought you&#8217;d heard enough about one of the messiest marriages in Hollywood history over the summer.</p>



<p>But it seems almost certain that a sequel to the epic battle between Depp and Heard is coming soon to a courtroom near you.</p>

<p>Rihanna is one of the most popular and beloved celebrities on the planet.</p>



<p>And Johnny Depp is pretty much the opposite of that.</p>



<p>But for some reason, RiRi is putting her reputation on the line for a man whose name has become synonymous with abhorrent behavior &#8212; and fans are not happy about it.</p>



<p>It was revealed this week that Depp will appear in Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie show, which is set to premiere on Amazon Prime on November 9.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The show will stream live, but Depp will make his appearance in a cameo that&#8217;s already been recorded.</p>



<p>Rihanna owns 30 percent of Fenty, and if you were hoping that the decision to include Depp came from one of her business partners, then we&#8217;re afraid we have some bad news:</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adeonibada/rihanna-johnny-depp-savage-fenty-runway">new report</a> from BuzzFeed News, the decision to include an appearance by Depp was Rihanna&#8217;s and Rihanna&#8217;s alone.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Details of the cameo have been hard to come by, but insiders say Depp will be “the first male celebrity figure” to have this role.</p>



<p>The move has led critics online to describe Rihanna as being “out of touch,&#8221; and many have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration.</p>



<p>“Savage x Fenty is already a flop adding Johnny Depp to the mix is just another example of how out of touch Rihanna actually is,” one person wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Rihanna inviting Johnny Depp to her show is so, so fucking weird. Not a single billionaire on this planet with decency and she’s keeping up the trend sadly,” another tweeted.</p>



<p>Of course, there were also thousands of tweets those who were supportive of the move.</p>



<p>&#8220;People in the comments saying, &#8216;Rihanna this isn&#8217;t you&#8217; like the know her personally. Ffs, she can have whoever she wants in her own show,&#8221; one person posted.</p>

But for some reason, Rihanna is still a big supporter. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Johnny Depp proved his innocence and I&#8217;m tired of y&#8217;all defending a woman who is a proven multiple time abuser. It&#8217;s weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A bunch of evidence clearing Johnny Depp’s name and y’all still slandering him and dragging Rihanna into it?? It’s mental illness,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s true that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/johnny-depp-wins-lawsuit-against-amber-heard-actor-is-awarded-10/">Depp won his lawsuit against Amber Heard</a>, he did not &#8220;prove his innocence,&#8221; as it was not a criminal trial.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In fact, testimony and evidence that were presented at trial proved that both parties engaged in abusive throughout their brief marriage, and Depp was the instigator of most of the couple&#8217;s violent altercations.</p>



<p>Depp was awarded $10.35 million in damages after a jury found that Heard had defamed him after their divorce.</p>



<p>Heard was awarded $2 million in her countersuit, and in a shocking act of pettiness, Depp is now appealing that decision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are back in the news. And once again, the drama between the exes is very messy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>News of Depp&#8217;s appearance at the Fenty show comes on the heels of the actor&#8217;s surprising cameo at the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/amber-heards-sister-blasts-johnny-depp-following-surprise-vmas-cameo-absolutely-disgusting/">2022 MTV Video Music Awards</a>.</p>



<p>“I needed the work. I just want you guys to know that I’m available for birthdays, bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, wakes, any old thing you need,” Depp joked on stage.</p>



<p>Judging from the reaction on social media, the audience at home wasn&#8217;t laughing.</p>



<p>And the Fenty show is likely to receive a similarly tepid response.</p>

<p>But it seems that we&#8217;re still not done talking about the most bonkers celebrity court case since O.J. Simpson <s>got away with</s> was acquitted of double murder.</p>



<p>As you may recall, throughout the trial, there were rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/camille-vasquez-johnny-depp-deserved-to-have-a-woman-defend-him/">Depp was dating Camille Vasquez</a>, the attorney who memorably cross-examined Heard on his behalf.</p>



<p>This turned out not to be the case (more on that later), but it seems that Depp was hooking up with a different lawyer during his battle with Heard.</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/johnny-depp-is-dating-married-lawyer-joelle-rich-from-u-k-libel-case/">new report</a> from Us Weekly, Depp is dating a British attorney named Joelle Rich.</p>



<p>Rich was reportedly on hand throughout Depp&#8217;s high-profile trial &#8212; but not in a professional capacity.</p>



<p>The London-based lawyer made the trip to Virginia just to offer emotional support to Depp.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-458821" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1240715304-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Johnny Depp is reportedly dating Joelle Rich.

<p></p>



<p>The photo above shows Rich celebrating with Depp&#8217;s legal team after the verdict was announced.</p>



<p>“There was no professional obligation for her being there,” a source told the magazine, adding that Depp and Rich would “discreetly” meet up in hotels during the trial.</p>



<p>Now, Rich didn&#8217;t represent Depp in his US libel case, but she did work for him when the actor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/11/johnny-depp-loses-50-dollars-million-lawsuit-amber-heard-did-not/">sued UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em></a><em> </em>back in 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Johnny Depp celebrating his legal victory. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Depp lost that case, but apparently he hit it off with Rich, and the two of them started dating after the trial came to an end.</p>



<p>So yeah, Depp and Rich have been dating for upwards of two years.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not sure how they managed to keep their relationship a secret for so long, but those who know the couple  best say that </p>

<p></p>



<p>“Their chemistry is off the charts,” a source close to the situation tells <em>Us</em>. </p>



<p>“It’s serious between them. They are the real deal.”</p>



<p>As for the rumors that Depp was hooking up with Vasquez &#8212; we&#8217;re not sure how those got started, but it&#8217;s possible that someone in the media received some inaccurate info involving Johnny and a female attorney.</p>



<p>Whatever the case Vasquez was quick to shoot those rumors down in a recent interview.</p>

<p>“I care very deeply about my clients, and we have obviously become close,” she recently told <em>People</em> magazine.</p>



<p>“But when I say ‘we,’ I mean the entire team, and of course that includes Johnny,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>“It’s also an unethical charge being made. It’s sexist. It’s unfortunate, and it’s disappointing, but at the same time, it kind of comes with the territory. I can’t say I was all that surprised.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Depp&#8217;s reputation sustained some serious damage as a result of the shocking revelations made during the Heard trial.</p>



<p>But it seems that the former heartthrob is still a hit with at least one female fan.</p>

<p>There were several surprises at the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/2022-mtv-vmas-the-complete-list-of-surprising-winners/">2022 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, but none generated as much controversy as the bizarre cameo from Johnny Depp.</p>



<p>Fresh from his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/kate-moss-amber-heard-was-lying-johnny-depp-is-no-abuser/">legal victory against ex-wife Amber Heard</a>, Depp &#8220;appeared&#8221; on stage in the form of a digital projection on the mask of the network&#8217;s iconic Moonman mascot.</p>



<p>The cameo was supposed to be a surprise, but reports about Depp&#8217;s appearance leaked several days before Sunday&#8217;s broadcast.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Johnny Depp made a surprise appearance at the 2022 VMAs. But the cameo was not appreciated by all. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;You know what? I needed the work,&#8221; Depp quipped during his first appearance at the beginning of the night.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey VMAs, let&#8217;s get back to the f—ing music, shall we?&#8221; the actor later joked as the show came back from commercial.</p>



<p>Depp returned to the &#8220;out of work actor&#8221; schtick later in the evening, with a joke about how he&#8217;s available for private events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Johnny Depp posted this post-trial pic while he was on tour with guitarist Jeff Beck. (Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I just want you guys to know I’m available for birthdays, bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, wakes… Any old thing you need, you name it,” Depp joked, adding:</p>



<p> “Oh — and I’m also a dentist.”</p>



<p>Depp&#8217;s appearance was met with applause by the audience at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>On social media, however, the reaction was considerably more mixed.</p>



<p>Many viewers spoke out against MTV&#8217;s decision to involve Depp in the broadcast despite the allegations of physical and emotional abuse that Heard made against him during the trial.</p>



<p>One of the most vocal critics was Amber&#8217;s sister, Whitney Henriquez.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Whitney Hentiquez spoke out on behalf of her sister, Amber Heard. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;@MTV YOU&#8217;RE DISGUSTING AND CLEARLY DESPERATE! I REALLY HOPE THAT NONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THIS CALL HAVE DAUGHTERS… #DVMAS #ISTANDWITHAMBERHEARD,&#8221; Henriquez wrote on Instagram, along with a poignantly altered version of the VMAs promotional art.</p>



<p>Whitney referred to the show as the &#8220;#DVMAS&#8221; with the &#8220;DV&#8221; seemingly standing for domestic violence.</p>



<p>Henriquez was not alone in her criticism, with many Twitter and Instagram users speaking out in Amber&#8217;s defense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="657" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1024x657.jpg" alt="Amber Heard Leaves Court" class="wp-image-449315" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-768x492.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-2048x1313.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-735x471.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-335x215.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-347x222.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-520x333.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-640x410.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-960x616.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1080x693.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Amber Heard leaving a Virginia courthouse.

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly f-ck the VMA’s for including Johnny Depp. the entire crowd of Amber’s industry peers are cheering for her abuser. it makes me sick. the industry hasn’t changed at all,&#8221; one person tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not surprised, but still so disappointed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is disgusting that the VMAs included an abuser and the whole audience clapped while his victim was globally humiliated and now has to see that her former friends and coworkers are cheering for her abuser,&#8221; another user wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>During the defamation trial, Whitney testified that she had witnessed Depp become abusive with Heard on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>Henriquez also alleged that Depp once struck her while she was trying to protect Heard.</p>



<p>Amber has yet to speak out on Johnny&#8217;s inclusion in the VMAs broadcast, and she might choose to keep mum for legal reasons.</p>

<p>Heard&#8217;s first appeal petition was rejected, but insiders say the actress plans to continue fighting for a second trial.</p>
