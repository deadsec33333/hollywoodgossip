										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>We hope enjoyed that brief two-week break from Gisele Bundchen-Tom Brady updates.</p>



<p>Because the former couple is back in the news in a big way today &#8212; and they&#8217;re bringing a couple of friends with them.</p>



<p>Gisele and Tom are now joined by former NFL wide receiver and noted crazy person Antonio Brown, who has spent the past several weeks gleefully posting about his ex-QB&#8217;s divorce.</p>



<p>But while some of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-says-shes-done-with-tom-brady-antonio-brown-taunts-goat-qb-on-instagram/">AB&#8217;s anti-Brady memes</a> have been darkly humorous, he really crossed the line with his latest trolling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As TMZ <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/22/antonio-brown-fake-gisele-nude-pic-bizarre-tom-brady-beef/">reports</a> Brown posted fake nude photos of Gisele on his Snapchat page today.</p>



<p>The pics didn&#8217;t stay up for very long, of course, but it was still an idiotic move from Brown, and we imagine the whole incident was rather humiliating for Gisele.</p>



<p>Brown also posted a doctored photo, in which Gisele appears to be posing with her arms around him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Antonio Brown&#8217;s Snapchat page is a very strange place. (Photo via Snapchat)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The weird thing about all of this is that the story of Brown&#8217;s bizarre NFL career would be much shorter were it not for the support that he received from Brady.</p>



<p>Most teams considered Brown persona non grata after multiple women accused him of sexual assault, but Brady used his considerable clout to get the wide receiver signed to both the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Bucs.</p>



<p>So we guess Tom is learning a valuable lesson about sticking his neck out to protect and enable abusers?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461701" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Tom Brady has broken his silence about his divorce. Not surprisingly, he says he&#8217;s focusing on football. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, folks, everyone in this story is bad except for Gisele, who thankfully is winning this divorce in decisive fashion.</p>



<p>First, the media provided constant reminders that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/tom-brady-gisele-bundchens-net-worth-revealed-will-their-divorce-be-the-most-expensive-in-sports-history/"> Gisele&#8217;s net worth</a> is far greater than her ex&#8217;s.</p>



<p>And now, it looks as though Bundchen might have already moved on with a new boo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="661" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1024x661.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461471" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-300x194.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-768x496.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1536x991.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-2048x1322.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-735x474.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-335x216.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-347x224.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-520x336.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-640x413.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-960x620.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1080x697.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen are officially divorced. The couple made the news official Friday morning. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nothing has been confirmed yet, but Gisele has been spending an awful lot of time with her yoga instructor, Joaquim Valente.</p>



<p>Gisele and Joaquim even took a vacation to Costa Rica together, but sources close to the non-couple swear they&#8217;re just friends.</p>



<p>That may be true, but we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn that these two are hitting the mat and contorting themselves into all sorts of bonkers positions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1024x680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-457798" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-735x488.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-520x345.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-640x425.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-960x638.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1080x717.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen went from separated to divorced in record time.

<p></p>



<p>Anyway, Gisele moved into her new digs in Miami beach this week, and there have been rumors that she&#8217;ll be living with Joaquim.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like that&#8217;s the case, but it&#8217;s worth noting that friends of Valente&#8217;s were spotted helping Bundchen move the last of her stuff.</p>



<p>Make of that what you will.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As for Tom, he&#8217;s gearing up for a matchup against the Browns this week.</p>



<p>And by that we mean he&#8217;s playing the Cleveland football team, not squaring off in a rumble against Antonio and entire his family.</p>



<p>Although honestly, that&#8217;s a possibility, too.</p>

<p>Well, we probably should&#8217;ve known this would happen.</p>



<p>Every time an A-list couple gets divorced, their reps swear the split will be civil (after they finally admit that it&#8217;s actually happening, of course), and every time things eventually get ugly.</p>



<p>In fact, the more famous the couple, the messier their breakup will inevitably become.</p>



<p>And couples don&#8217;t get much more famous than Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Yes, as you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/tom-brady-deeply-depressed-amid-gisele-bundchen-divorce-insiders-claim/">Brady and Bundchen have separated</a>, and it looks as though their marriage is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Insiders say the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-have-both-hired-divorce-lawyers-report/">Tom and Gisele have both hired divorce lawyers</a> and have been living separately for several months.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it sounds like this relationship is well and truly over &#8212; and apparently that&#8217;s just fine with Gisele.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is done with their marriage,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/sports/gisele-bundchen-is-done-with-marriage-to-tom-brady/">an insider </a>close to Bundchen tells <em>People</em> magazine.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was upset about it for a long time and it&#8217;s still difficult, but she feels like she needs to move on. She doesn&#8217;t believe that her marriage can be repaired.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source says that Bundchen &#8220;is doing okay&#8221; and has come to terms with the fact that the relationship is over.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;She is just trying to figure out her life,&#8221; the source says. </p>



<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t have much contact with Tom.&#8221;</p>



<p>As for living arrangements, the insider confirms that Gisele has been spending most of her time at a home that she and Tom recently purchased together in Miami.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Gisele loves Miami. She has friends there. She can see herself living there permanently,&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Again, she is still trying to figure things out. She is doing yoga, meditating and taking care of herself. She doesn&#8217;t put any pressure on herself to make drastic decisions.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s probably been tough for Tom to keep his mind on football this season.</p>



<p>And making matters even more difficult is the fact that former NFL wide receiver and current crazy person Antonio Brown is taunting the QB with memes about himself and Gisele.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Bundchen and Brown celebrate together. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>First, Brown (whose career was repeatedly rescued by Brady) posted the above photo in which he and Gisele are seen celebrating the Buccaneers Super Bowl victory.</p>



<p>He followed that up with a meme about a children&#8217;s divorce book.</p>



<p>As you can see, the cover of “Daddy Doesn’t Live Here Anymore: A Book About Divorce&#8221; was altered to suggest that Brown has moved into the Brady home in Tom&#8217;s absence.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Imagine the guy that gave you your only shot left in the nfl, wanted to see you succeed just to disrespect him in the end of your relevance,” one person commented on the post, according to Page Six.</p>



<p>“Why? Dude took you in &amp; you clown him, foul!!!&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Crazy how your [sic] disrespecting the man who gave you an opportunity to play football when no one else did and was the reason you won a Super Bowl,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<p>Hopefully, these commenters can rest easy in the knowledge that Tom has much bigger problems than some trolling from a former teammate.</p>
