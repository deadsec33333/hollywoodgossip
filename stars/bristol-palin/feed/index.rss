<p>The most siginificant of these was the <a href="/slideshows/farrah-abraham-ill-return-to-teen-mom-under-one-condition/">firing of Farrah Abrham </a>and the addition of several non-OGs, including Bristol Palin.</p>
<p>Bristol is kind of an obscure figure these days, but it wasn&#8217;t all that long ago that she was a household name.</p>
<p>Her mother, of course, is the infamous Sarah Palin, who came dangerously close to becoming vice-president in 2008.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>(That&#8217;s not a political comment. Regardless of your party affiliation or your feelings on McCain vs. Obama, hopefully we can all agree that the Palin&#8217;s turned out to be as nutty as poor Honey Boo Boo&#8217;s family.)</p>
<p><a href="/2018/07/bristol-palin-teen-mom-og-salary-revealed-gigantic/">Bristol&#8217;s casting</a> was huge news when it was announced back in 2018.</p>
<p>Alas, the weirdest partnership in the the history of reality television was not long for this world.</p>

<p><a href="/slideshows/bristol-palin-did-she-just-quit-teen-mom-og/">Palin quit<em> Teen Mom OG</em></a> after just one season.</p>
<p>She offered no explanation at the time, but insiders claimed she was unhappy with the experience and the manner in which she was portrayed on the show.</p>
<p>In the years since her departure, Bristol has shown little interest in MTV&#8217;s flagship franchise, declining to comment on the various Teen Mom dramas that have unfolded in the years&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Earlier this week, however, the mother of three surprised her Instagram followers by revisiting the series and sharing her reactions on her Stories.</p>
<p>&quot;Y&#8217;all, you&#8217;re not gonna believe what I&#8217;m watching right now. That is not me,&quot; Bristol told her audience before panning over to her TV screen to reveal an old episode of TMOG.</p>
<p>&quot;I almost forgot about all this.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Okay, she&#8217;s obviously lying about that last part, but still, Bristol&#8217;s reactions to her scenes are interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;I CANNOT!&quot; she exclained before sharing another video of her TV screen.</p>
<p>&quot;I really cannot,&quot; she captioned the post, in case you somehow missed her point.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="420" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og.jpg" alt="Bristol Palin as an OG" class="wp-image-316321" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og.jpg 748w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-480x270.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-720x405.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-320x180.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-735x413.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-335x188.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-347x195.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-520x292.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-640x359.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Y&#8217;all, we all go through struggles. I will admit it&#8217;s very weird watching it play out on TV, especially when you haven&#8217;t thought about this show, or even acknowledge that you&#8217;ve been on anything like this before,&quot; she explained in yet another post,<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4403674/teen-mom-bristol-palin-mtv-show-embarrassing-old-clip/"> according to</a> The Sun.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s very weird seeing it in retrospect, I&#8217;ll be honest with you, but my kids are so cute so I think it&#8217;s special to see that. Crazy, crazy, crazy. Full circle. God is good.&quot;</p>
<p>Full disclosure: We don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to watch old episodes of ourselves on a reality show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="420" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses.jpg" alt="Bristol Palin in Glasses" class="wp-image-316323" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses.jpg 748w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-480x270.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-720x405.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-320x180.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-735x413.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-335x188.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-347x195.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-520x292.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-in-glasses-640x359.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But, c&#8217;mon, Bristol &#8212; this footage is only a few years old.</p>
<p>No need to cringe yourself to death like you&#8217;re re-opening your high school yearbook.</p>
<p>&quot;Embarrassing, but let&#8217;s get reallllll,&quot; Bristol wrote in a caption on yet another Story.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;New to Texas.. didn&#8217;t know anyone or have any support here.. no job.. 3 young kids.. and my husband had just left me..&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, we get the need to justify her behavior, but Bristol did have a job at the time &#8212; she was a reality TV star!</p>
<p>Palin went on to explain that these days, she&#8217;s doing better than ever, and her newly-launched real estate firm is thriving.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Full circle.. my kids are happy and healthy,&quot; Bristol wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Have an incredible crew and together we have created a rapidly successful, and growing business. (helping over 70 families in the last 12 months alone)&quot;</p>
<p>Full circle would mean that she wound up back where she started, but we&#8217;ll stop nit-picking Bristol&#8217;s comments and leave her alone.</p>
<p>After all, we&#8217;d rather have the Palins selling houses than trying to get into the White House!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>In November, reality TV star and real life villain <a href="/2019/11/janson-moore-is-dating-bristol-palin-for-reasons-no-one-can-comp/">Bristol Palin went Instagram official with some random dude</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Bristol&#8217;s time on Teen Mom, it wasn&#8217;t meant to last. She and Janson Moore are no more.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Janson was Bristol&#8217;s first romance since her ill-fated relationship with Dakota Meyer ran its course.</p>
<p>He is a former Texas A&amp;M quarterback.</p>
<p>These days, Janson is located in Austin, where he works as a medical sales representative.</p>
<p>It was not initially clear why the two connected in the first place, but they clearly hit it off &#8230; for a limited time.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On Sunday, December 29, a fan asked Bristol a simple question via Instagram.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you dating anyone?&quot; the fan inquired.</p>
<p>Answering in her Stories, Bristol made the answer abundantly clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Noo,&quot; she replied. The extra &quot;o&quot; could be a typo, but we interpret it as being there for added emphasis.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Incidentally, the <a href="/2019/04/bristol-palin-confirms-teen-mom-og-departure-will-be-missed-by-e/">failed reality star</a> and the 24-year-old sales rep still follow each other on Instagram.</p>
<p>That may sound like small potatoes, but we&#8217;ve seen actually <em>married </em>couples unfollow each other when they&#8217;re arguing.</p>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;re still talking? But it seems more likely that Bristol and Janson just weren&#8217;t dating enough to work up to having hard feelings.</p>
<p>But they have scrubbed each other from their respective feeds of photos. Standard breakup stuff.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After Bristol went Instagram official with her single status, <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/12/bristol-palin-splits-with-boyfriend-janson-moore/"><em>RadarOnline</em></a> learned from an inside source that the pair split before the holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, they&rsquo;re done,&rdquo; the insider confirmed.</p>
<p>The report also shed some light on why they went their separate ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say Bristol didn&rsquo;t know much about his past relationship and how recent it was,&quot; the source revealed shadily.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But coming to realize that she was, best case scenario, a rebound was not the only factor that caused Bristol to turn tail and run.</p>
<p>&quot;And she realized early on that he just has a lot of growing up to do,&quot; the insider added.</p>
<p>Dating a younger man with an athletic background is all fun and games until you realize that a 24-year-old&#8217;s brain is still finishing developing.</p>
<p>Bristol has been a mom since she was a teenager. It&#8217;s not too surprising if a Janson wasn&#8217;t quite the right match for her.</p>

<p>Janson had only divorced his ex, Mackenzie Hausenfluck, a real human whose name we did not make up, three months before hooking up with Bristol.</p>
<p>Three months is a fine amount of time to date again after, say, breaking up with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>A lot of people would consider that a relatively short time to enter a serious relationship after getting divorced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After three months, the ink is barely dry on the divorce papers.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="420" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og.jpg" alt="Bristol Palin as an OG" class="wp-image-316321" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og.jpg 748w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-480x270.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-720x405.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-320x180.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-735x413.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-335x188.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-347x195.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-520x292.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/bristol-palin-as-an-og-640x359.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Of course, 24 is pretty young to be divorced &#8212; it&#8217;s actually pretty young to be married at all.</p>
<p>But just because someone is trying to get a jumpstart on adult milestones (and might be a lot romantic, might be a lot religious) doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>And Bristol is a mother of three children.</p>
<p>When she goes out on dates, she&#8217;s probably looking for more than Netflix and Chill.</p>
<p>Oh, well. Time for her to move on to her next mistake. That&#8217;s how life goes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Several years ago, during her run for Vice President of the United States, Sarah Palin mocked Barack Obama for a platform based on &quot;hope and change.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, well over a decade later, however, the unintelligent former politican&#8217;s daughter says she is gonna rely on hope in the wake of a major life change:</p>
<p>The divorce of her parents.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday afternoon, <a href="/2019/09/sarah-palin-files-for-divorce-from-husband-todd/">Sarah and Todd Palin announced they were splitting</a> after 31 years of marriage.</p>
<p>In documents filed in Anchorage Superior Court late last week, Sarah cited &quot;incompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife&quot; as the cause of the split.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p>These two are totally sick of being married to each other!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll refrain from making any jokes here about how it took Todd so long to arrive at such a conclusion.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sarah, of course, rose to national prominence after she was selected by John McCain to serve as his running mate in the 2008 presidential election.</p>
<p>The pair lost to Barack Obama and Joe Biden and then Palin resigned as governor of Alaska after just three years in office, in order to focus on a career in media.</p>
<p>She served as a Fox News correspondent for awhile and now&#8230; just Tweets sometimes, we guess.</p>
<p>But daughter Bristol appeared on Dancing with the Stars and also anchored her own short-lived reality show and then actually joined <a href="/categories/teen-mom-og/">Teen Mom OG</a> last year.</p>
<p>We still can&#8217;t believe that happened.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday morning, meanwhile, Bristol shared on her Instagram Story a sermon from a Texas pastor called &ldquo;Abounding in Hope,&rdquo; a reference to a line in the Bible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely safe to assume she did so because she knew that news of her parents&#8217; break-up would soon go viral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When hope is present, people are encouraged to lay hold of what heaven has for them,&rdquo; Christian Life Austin Pastor Rex Johnson says in the sermon, from March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some have referred to hope as the &lsquo;middle sister&rsquo; of faith and love,&rdquo; he also says in it. &ldquo;I like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah and Todd Palin met as high school students in Wasilla, Alaska and eloped in 1988.</p>
<p>They five children together, including Bristol &#8212; and Todd is seeking joint custody of 11-year old Trig, the only kid who still lives at home.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bristol, for her part, was also once married.</p>
<p>She divorced Dakota Meyer in 2018, however, with nearly every moment Bristol spent on screen as a Teen Mom devoted to problems between the then-couple.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/04/bristol-palin-confirms-teen-mom-og-departure-will-be-missed-by-e/">Palin quit the MTV show in April</a>, jumping up high on her pedstal and stating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teen mom OG wasn&rsquo;t a fit for me, it took away my peace.. and honestly &ndash; my peace has a price tag that no one but God can afford&#8230;</p>
<p>&ldquo;$ doesn&rsquo;t impress me, I don&rsquo;t entertain bs, and walking away from this show allows God to rebuild me (and my little fam) in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>As for her fellow Teen Mom stars?</p>
<p>&quot;I have love for all the girls on the show, and wish them the best of luck in all their future endeavors!! xoxo, B,&quot; she concluded.</p>

<p>It all started when <a href="/2017/12/farrah-abraham-the-real-story-behind-her-teen-mom-og-firing/">Farrah Abraham got fired from Teen Mom OG</a> back in December of 2017.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="874" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-1024x874.png" alt="Teen Mom 5" class="wp-image-330781" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-1024x874.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-300x256.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-768x655.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-735x627.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-335x286.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-347x296.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-520x444.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-640x546.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-960x819.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5-1080x922.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/teen-mom-5.png 1159w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Though no one could ever hope to fill Farrah&#8217;s shoes in terms of batsh-t drama, MTV tried by <a href="/slideshows/farrah-abraham-trashes-teen-mom-replacements-what-pathetic-dumb/">hiring Bristol Palin and Cheyenne Floyd</a>.</p>
<p>Floyd turned out to be a good fit for the cast &#8212; Bristol, not so much.</p>
<p>The daughter of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin quit the show after just one season, claiming that the life of a reality star was simply not for her.</p>
<p>(Bristol has appeared on numerous other reality shows, including two that were based entirely on her life and were quickly canceled, so she probably just didn&#8217;t enjoy appearing on this particular series, but whatever &#8230;)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teen-mom-og-cast-hopes-mtv-wont-replace-bristol-palin/">recent interview</a> with <em>Us </em><em>Weekly</em> the remaining OG cast (the OGs of OG, if you will) were asked for their thoughts on the possibility of MTV hiring a replacement for Bristol.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the ladies were less than thrilled with the prospect of sharing screen time with another newcomer, thus rendering them more inessential to the series&#8217; future:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re good,&rdquo; Amber Portwood told the tabloid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No new friends,&rdquo; echoed Maci Bookout.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="525" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/maci-on-season-8.jpg" alt="Maci on Season 8" class="wp-image-310949" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/maci-on-season-8.jpg 634w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/maci-on-season-8-300x248.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/maci-on-season-8-335x277.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/maci-on-season-8-347x287.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/maci-on-season-8-520x431.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m good with just four,&rdquo; Catelynn Lowell added.</p>
<p>Like we said, the responses are not surprising &#8212; but they&#8217;re more than a little misguided.</p>
<p>It appears this is a case of employees mistakenly believing they&#8217;re management.</p>
<p>You see, Bristol was added to the cast &#8212; and <a href="/2018/07/bristol-palin-teen-mom-og-salary-revealed-gigantic/">paid more than the rest of the moms</a> &#8212; for very good reason:</p>

<p>Teen Mom OG ratings have been plummetting for years, and they took a sharp nosedive after Farrah got fired.</p>
<p>Love her or hate her, Ms. Abraham&#8217;s insanity made her a reliable ratings magnet &#8212; something the show is sorely lacking these days.</p>
<p>The current cast might like things the way they are &#8212; but surely they&#8217;d prefer keeping their jobs over joining Farrah on the unemployment line.</p>
<p>As for her own experience on the show, Floyd said that after a rocky start, she feels she&#8217;s been fully embraced by the Teen Mom community:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people thought that we would mesh so well, but I think we all went in and we&rsquo;re [thinking], &lsquo;No judgment, open minds, let&rsquo;s get to know each other in a real organic way.&#8217;&rdquo; Cheyenne told Us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like we&rsquo;ve done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sounds like Cheyenne is well aware that there&#8217;s bound to be a lot of ups and downs living in the public eye in 2019 &#8212; but ultimately her cushy job and six-figure paycheck make it all worthwhile.</p>
<p>The other moms might do well to emulate her attitude.</p>
