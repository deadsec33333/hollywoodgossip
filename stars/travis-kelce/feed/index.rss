<p>Fan speculation that Taylor Swift is pregnant has been spiking.</p>



<p>Taylor and Travis seem to be keeping a low profile. That&#8217;s in stark contrast from recent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-bathroom-bodyguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public appearances</a>.</p>



<p>There can be a few reasons for that, but it&#8217;s a tried-and-true method of hiding a baby bump. We&#8217;ve seen it before.</p>



<p>Is Taylor pregnant? Is she hiding relationship troubles? Or is this something else? Here&#8217;s what we know:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on November 4, 2024." class="wp-image-517640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0123_taylorswift_01-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift arrives before the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay buccaneers at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on November 04, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-in-the-world-is-taylor-swift">Where in the world is Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>A few weeks ago, a super rare video of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce hit the internet. Fans spotted the two in Park City, Utah.</p>



<p>Just days later, the two again went on a low-key outing. This time, a dinner date in New York.</p>



<p>In late March, reports had Taylor and Travis dining with Erin Andrews in Big Sky, Montana. </p>



<p>Notably, she apparently encouraged the two to date in the first place.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Travis Kelce CAUGHT RECORDING Taylor Swift for the iHeartRadio Music Awards Speech..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/swjeic-cfK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Sometimes, when a couple who was once virtually omnipresent starts acting private, it&#8217;s a red flag.</p>



<p>When a romance is on the rocks, people try to avoid public fights. </p>



<p>Especially when they are in the spotlight. Taylor and Travis are one of the planet&#8217;s most famous couples, and she&#8217;s someone who likes to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-wedding-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan ahead</a>.</p>



<p>On the flip side, sometimes there&#8217;s a very different reason to hide. When you want to hide your baby bump, you&#8217;d hide your whole body. And some fans wonder if Taylor is doing just that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce on September 8, 2024." class="wp-image-516300" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0108_traviskelce_01.jpg 1753w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce attend the Men&#8217;s Singles Final match between Taylor Fritz of the United States and Jannik Sinner of Italy on Day Fourteen of the 2024 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apparently-this-famous-couple-just-wants-some-peace-and-quiet">Apparently, this famous couple just wants some peace and quiet</h2>



<p>According to a report by <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/why-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-seemingly-disappeared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>, an inside source assures that Taylor and Travis &#8220;are still very much in love.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider characterized: “They’re simply recharging their batteries.”</p>



<p>Just as many introverts might need some alone time after a busy social event, some famous couples need to back down from whirlwind public appearances to nurture their relationship.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="720" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1024x720.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on September 11, 2024." class="wp-image-514773" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1024x720.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-768x540.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-2048x1440.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-960x675.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1080x759.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_taylorswift_02-1200x844.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards at UBS Arena on September 11, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Taylor’s been in rest-and-relaxation mode since she wrapped her Eras Tour in December,” the source shared.</p>



<p>According to the insider, “the plan has always been to enjoy the off-season with Travis by packing in a lot of travel.” </p>



<p>(The &#8220;off-season&#8221; refers to the months out of the year when football is not happening. We have all learned so much about this sport since Taylor took an interest in Travis)</p>



<p>The sole exception to this down time was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-grammy-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Grammy Awards</a> in February. That&#8217;s pretty <em>can&#8217;t-miss</em> for Taylor, for obvious reasons, even if she doesn&#8217;t always win.</p>

<p>The source went on to say that, after the Super Bowl &#8220;and all the pressure that went with it,&#8221; they needed this.</p>



<p>“He desperately needed a break,&#8221; the insider dished. &#8220;So Taylor surprised him with a super private trip.”</p>



<p>The source elaborated: “They’ve been hitting the slopes in Park City and Big Sky, where they blended right in. It helps that they can cover up their faces when they’re skiing, since most people are wearing helmets, goggles or face coverings. They love the anonymity.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift in August of 2024." class="wp-image-507505" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0820_taylorswift_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift performs on stage during the &#8220;Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour&#8221; at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kate Green/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, there is absolutely no proof of a Taylor pregnancy. </p>



<p>There have been no baby bump sightings. Taylor is a conspicuously tall (relatively) and slender woman. Pregnancy would not hide for long.</p>



<p>If some sort of exciting news leaks, we&#8217;ll be thrilled to share it. </p>



<p>But for now, it sounds like Taylor and Travis are just trying to take it easy.</p>

<p>Travis Kelce has arrived at a decision about his future.</p>



<p>No, the legendary tight end has not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/is-taylor-swift-engaged/">proposed to Taylor Swift</a>. Not yet at least. Not to our knowledge. We&#8217;re not talking about the athlete&#8217;s <em>personal</em> future.</p>



<p>When it comes to his <em>professional</em> future, however, and what it holds? Well&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming back for sure. Gonna try to get into the best shape I&#8217;ve been this offseason and get back to the mountaintop,&#8221; Kelce wrote in a text to television host Pat McAfee on Thursday. </p>



<p>Added Kelce, whose <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/">team got clobbered in the most recent Super Bowl</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;Got a real bad taste in my mouth with how I played in that last game and with how I got the guys ready for battle. I can&#8217;t go out like that!!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>So there we have it. Kelce will return next year to try and win another championship ring with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>

<p>The future Hall of Famer was held to four catches for 39 yards in the Chiefs&#8217; 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.</p>



<p>That performance ended a season in which Kelce posted career lows in receiving yards (823) and touchdowns (3). He did lead the team in receptions, however, with 97.</p>



<p>Following the disappointing setback on February 9, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said he was &#8220;not sure&#8221; if Kelce would return to the NFL for another season.</p>



<p>Mahomes also said he&#8217;s going to &#8220;let Travis make that decision on his own,&#8221; adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s given so much to this team and to the NFL. And he&#8217;s been such a joy, not only for me to work with, but for people to watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelce has been selected to play in the Pro Bowl 10 times and was a first-team All-Pro pick four times and a second-team choice three times.</p>



<p>The guy is really good and always has been.</p>



<p>Of late, of course, Kelce has become far better known as Taylor Swift&#8217;s boyfriend.</p>



<p>With rumors of another <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-tour-another-coming-in-2026/">Taylor Swift tour coming in 2026</a>, some observers thought maybe Kelce would hang up his cleats and just follow the singer around the globe for awhile.</p>



<p>Alas, Travis Kelce as a perpetual groupie will need to wait at least one more year.</p>

<p>While fans continue to have questions about Travis Kelce&#8217;s personal life (namely, did he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/did-taylor-swift-get-engaged-fans-left-with-questions-after-travis-kelces-shocking-super-bowl-loss/">propose to Taylor Swift</a> last weekend?), the Kansas City Chiefs tight end took to his New Heights podcast and addressed the main question facing his <em>professional</em> life.</p>



<p>Namely, is Travis Kelce going to retire from professional football?</p>



<p>Kelce touched on this topic in the wake of his team getting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/">trounced in the latest Super Bowl</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know everybody wants to know whether I&#8217;m playing next year, and right now, I&#8217;m just kicking everything down the road. I&#8217;m kicking every can I can down the road. I&#8217;m not making any crazy decisions,&#8221; Kelce said on air.</p>



<p>In the week leading up to the annual big game, Kelce said on numerous occasions that he planned to play in 2025.</p>



<p>However, he struck a different tone while speaking to brother Jason Kelce on the siblings&#8217; beloved podcast.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been fortunate over the past five, six years &#8212; I&#8217;ve played more football than anybody,&#8221; Travis said. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because of the people that are in that building. The fact that we keep going to these AFC championships and these Super Bowls, that means I&#8217;m playing an extra three games more than everybody else in the entire league. </p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of wear and tear on your body, and it&#8217;s a lot of time spent in the building, focusing on your craft, focusing on the task at hand and every challenge that you set up for yourself.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519089" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce talks during media availability prior to Super Bowl LIX at the New Orleans Marriott on February 6, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Continued Kelce:</p>



<p>&#8220;That process can be grueling. It can weigh on you. It can make you better. It can drive you crazy at the same time. And right now, it&#8217;s one of those things where it was driving me crazy this year. It happens as you kind of tail off towards the back nine of your career.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kelce is 35 years old.</p>



<p>He was held to four catches for 39 yards in the Chiefs&#8217; 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX and just concluded a season in which he posted career lows in receiving yards (823) and touchdowns (3). </p>



<p>If Travis were to retire, of course, he&#8217;d have more time to dedicate to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-wedding-plans/">wedding planning with Swift</a>.</p>



<p>He does need to pop a certain question first, however.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="648" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1024x648.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518420" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-300x190.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-768x486.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-2048x1296.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-960x607.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1080x683.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1200x759.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce celebrates with Taylor Swift after the Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills 32-29 to win the AFC Championship Game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on January 26, 2025 in Kansas City, Missouri.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The veteran athlete and the world&#8217;s number-one Swiftie also delved into the “tough reality” of realizing one’s success might look different than it used to, calling it a “tough pill to swallow.”</p>



<p>He concluded as follows:</p>



<p>“So I’m gonna take some time to figure it out.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back, that it’s gonna be something that it’s a wholehearted decision, that I’m not half-assing it. That I’m fully here with them, and I think I could play. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s just whether or not I’m motivated or it’s the best decision for me as a man, as a human, as a person, to take on all that responsibility.”</p>

<p>As Travis Kelce prepares to play in the biggest football game of his life, the future Hall of Famer said this week that he might <em>also</em> be preparing to ask the most important question of his life.</p>



<p>To girlfriend Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>Seriously, you guys, these two might be engaged <em>tonight!</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="648" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1024x648.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518420" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-300x190.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-768x486.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-2048x1296.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-960x607.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1080x683.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196385075-1200x759.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce celebrates with Taylor Swift after the Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills 32-29 to win the AFC Championship Game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on January 26, 2025 in Kansas City, Missouri.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While speaking to reporters in New Orleans on February 3, Kielce was asked if he planned to propose to Swift at halftime of this Sunday&#8217;s Super Bowl.</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t you like to know,” the bearded tight end replied while smiling into the camera.</p>



<p>Simply put, <strong><em>yes</em></strong>. We would very much like to know, Travis.</p>



<p>Especially in the wake of speculation that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-wedding-plans/">you and Swift have at least talked about a wedding</a> and what it might look like.</p>

<p>Kelce and Swift have been dating for about a year and a half now.</p>



<p>The singer attended her lover&#8217;s January 28th AFC Championship Game in Kansas City, rocking an outfit that made some observers believe <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/taylor-swifts-game-day-fashion-choice-has-fans-convinced-that-shes-engaged-to-travis-kelce/">she and Kelce are already engaged</a>.</p>



<p>From what we can gather, this is not true. Kelce and Swift are not engaged. <em>Yet</em>.</p>



<p>Fans of both celebrities have been counting down the days until they will be, however, with many assuming that a Kansas City Chiefs victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9 will culminate with Kelce getting down on one knee amid the celebratory confetti.</p>

<p>Kelce, for his part, took on numerous questions about Swift during the Monday press conference, including his favorite food she makes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s quite the cook,&#8221; he told journalists. &#8220;I&#8217;m a breakfast guy, man. I would say her homemade Pop Tarts are unbelievable.&#8221;</p>



<p>As cool and calm as ever when the topic of his world-famous girlfriend was broached, Kelce also gushed over Swift by saying of his performance at the Super Bowl:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-518809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197310482-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I better hold up my end of the bargain. She&#8217;s up there being the superstar that she is and never taking no for an answer and always working her tail off. I better match that energy for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taylor, of course, will be in attendance at tonight&#8217;s game. However, she reportedly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-banned-from-taylor-swifts-super-bowl-suite-amid-justin-baldoni-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will <em>not</em> be joined by longtime friend Blake Lively</a>.</p>



<p>Insiders say Taylor has opted to distance herself from Lively amid the actress&#8217; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal battle with Justin Baldoni</a>.</p>



<p>No one believes Taylor is siding with Baldoni, but her decision to keep the drama at arms&#8217; length makes sense from a PR standpoint.</p>



<p>Besides, if Travis decides to get down on one knee after the game, he and Tay will probably want the spotlight to themselves for a bit.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good thing that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-thanksgiving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were able to spend Thanksgiving together.</a></p>



<p>Because that might be their last opportunity to get in any holiday quality time until New Year&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>Yes, we&#8217;re afraid we have some bad news for fans who were hoping that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis would surprise Taylor with an engagement ring</a> on Christmas.</p>

<p>(Obviously, fans would be thrilled by engagement news at <em>any</em> time of year. But hopes have been especially high in recent weeks, following news that Travis&#8217; fellow NFL star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/hailee-steinfelds-engaged-to-josh-allen-and-now-swifities-are-pressuring-travis-to-propose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Allen proposed to Taylor&#8217;s friend Hailee Steinfeld</a>.)</p>



<p>Yes, once again, professional obligations are interfering with Taylor and Travis&#8217; love story. But it seems that they&#8217;re making the most of the situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-travis-kelce-s-busy-christmas">Travis Kelce&#8217;s Busy Christmas</h2>



<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are set to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2008557096-1024x683.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs and Taylor Swift embrace after defeating the San Francisco 49ers in overtime during Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<p>The Steelers have been gaining steam in recent week, and they could present a challenge to Travis and the Chiefs, who will be playing on just four days&#8217; rest.</p>



<p>But more important to our discussion today is the fact that the game will be played at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh.</p>



<p>And as you may already know, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-skips-yet-another-chiefs-game-following-birthday-celebration-with-travis-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor has <em>not</em> been attending Travis&#8217; away games </a>in recent weeks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-taylor-be-in-attendance-at-travis-christmas-game">Will Taylor Be In Attendance at Travis&#8217; Christmas Game?</h2>



<p>Now, it&#8217;s possible that she&#8217;ll make an exception this time. </p>

<p>After all, it&#8217;s Christmas; Pennsylvania is her home state, and Pittsburgh is just a short private jet trip from Taylor&#8217;s current main residence in New York City.</p>



<p>(Although it&#8217;s worth noting that Taylor seems to be spending much of her time living with Travis in Kansas City.)</p>



<p>Page Six is reporting that it&#8217;s &#8220;unlikely&#8221; that Taylor will be in PA on game day. So Swifties probably won&#8217;t be spotting their fav in the stands on Christmas Day.</p>



<p>And the world&#8217;s most famous couple might not be able to spend Christmas together.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="734" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1968530700-9-1024x734.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with Taylor Swift after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on January 28, 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eyes-on-the-prize">Eyes on the Prize</h2>



<p>But Travis isn&#8217;t complaining and is instead focused on bringing home a W.</p>



<p>“I’ll play whenever, wherever. I just know that I’m so fortunate to be able to play this game that I’m gonna cherish every time I get to play on this field,&#8221; he said on this week&#8217;s episode of his <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/new-heights-with-jason-and-travis-kelce/episode/16389-travis-returns-to-the-land-jason-hypes-the-birds-and-drone-sweet-drones-ep-115/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;New Heights&#8221; podcast</a>.</p>



<p>“I think it’s gonna make it feel that much better if we can get out of this little three-game stretch with three wins. Make us feel a little bit more confident that we can get after it against some of the best teams week to week to week.”</p>



<p>As for rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jason-kelce-announces-retirement-13-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis will retire</a> after this season, the tight end may have dropped a hint after last Sunday&#8217;s win against the Browns in his hometown of Cleveland.</p>

<p>“I’ve only played there twice in 12 years, so unless we get thrown out there in the next couple, I don’t see it ever really happening again,” he stated on the podcast.</p>



<p>Some fans have taken that remark as an indication that Travis intends to play for a couple more years.</p>



<p>But with how much he&#8217;s got on his plate these days, we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see him hang up his cleats &#8212; especially if the Chiefs make history by winning a third straight Super Bowl in February.</p>

<p>The Kansas City Chiefs pulled off a decisive win over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday &#8212; but Taylor Swift was not there to see it.</p>



<p>Yes, once again, Taylor was <em>not</em> in the stands to watch her longtime boyfriend, Travis Kelce, dismantle an opposing defense.</p>



<p>And fans can&#8217;t figure out why Taylor decided to skip this one.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1970250659-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with Taylor Swift after defeating the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on January 28, 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-sits-one-out">Taylor Swift Sits One Out</h2>



<p>After all, her record-breaking <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-gave-eras-tour-team-197-million-in-bonuses-ridiculous-generous-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eras Tour has now come to an end</a>, which means Taylor&#8217;s schedule has finally opened up a bit.</p>



<p>Taylor isn&#8217;t <em>always</em> on hand for the Chiefs&#8217; road games, but she still has a pretty good attendance record when Travis travels.</p>



<p>And this one had special meaning for Travis, a Cleveland native who grew up a Browns fan.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1699256826-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Donna Kelce and Taylor Swift are seen during the first half of a game between the Chicago Bears and the Kansas City Chiefs at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on September 24, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri.

<p>So why wasn&#8217;t Tay cheering her man on from a luxury box?</p>



<p>Well, there could be any number of reasons why she decided to just watch this one from home.</p>



<p>For starters, a two-year world tour tends to take a lot out of a person. So Taylor might have decided to devote the remainder of 2024 to catching some well-deserved rest.</p>



<p>And that rest might be even more needed this week, as Taylor just celebrated her birthday on Friday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-s-birthday-was-a-memorable-occasion">Taylor&#8217;s Birthday Was a Memorable Occasion</h2>



<p>And according to insiders, Tay&#8217;s big day was one for the books.</p>



<p>She marked the occasion with Travis, who reportedly lavished her with presents.</p>



<p>“He got her a ton of gifts,” a source close to the situation tells <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/15/entertainment/taylor-swift-skips-chiefs-vs-brown-game-after-private-birthday-celebration-with-travis-kelce/?utm_campaign=pagesixdaily&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20241216&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=P6%20-%20Page%20Six%20Daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>The tight end reportedly attended the Chiefs&#8217; &#8220;mandatory&#8221; Christmas party in the afternoon before leaving early to spend time with Taylor.</p>



<p>Travis might not be <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-net-worth-billionaire-status-forbes-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a billionaire like Taylor</a>, but he does quite well for himself.</p>



<p>So we can only imagine what sort of luxury goods Taylor got to unwrap on the occasion of her 35th birthday.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166913977-2-1024x683.jpg" alt='Taylor Swift performs on stage during the "Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour" at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024 in London, England.

<p>But perhaps the best gift Travis gave Taylor was the freedom to just stay home and relax for once.</p>



<p>“[He is] so inspired by her and proud of all the hard work she’s done,” an insider recently told Page Six. </p>



<p>“At the same time, Travis feels it’s important for Taylor to take some time out for herself.”</p>



<p>Taylor and Travis both understand what it&#8217;s like to be exhausted, and she&#8217;s clearly just as empathetic to his plight.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/why-travis-kelce-missed-taylor-swift-last-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis missed the last show of the Eras Tour</a>, and there&#8217;s been no indication that Taylor was mad about it.</p>

<p>Hailee and Josh started dating in May of 2023, roughly around the same time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/travis-kelce-living-with-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor and Travis</a> began spending a lot of time together.</p>



<p>At 27 and 28, Hailee and Josh are younger than Taylor and Travis &#8212; but it looks as though they might beat the elder couple to the altar.</p>



<p>And of course, Hailee and Taylor are longtime friends, and Josh and Travis are both NFL players. So we suppose it should come as no surprise that fans are fixating on the similarities between the two relationships.</p>

<p>Life is not a race, of course, and Taylor and Travis are almost certainly not concerned about comparing themselves to other couples.</p>



<p>But Swifties? Well, it seems that such matters are <em>very much</em> on their minds these days!</p>

<p>Josh proposed last weekend, during the Buffalo Bills&#8217; bye week. But he and Hailee just went public with the news on Saturday.</p>

<p>Travis was quick to respond, commenting, &#8220;Congratulations!!!&#8221; along with a pair of clapping hand emojis.</p>



<p>(The Bills brought the Kansas City Chiefs&#8217; nearly yearlong winning streak to an end earlier this month, but clearly, there are no hard feelings on Travis&#8217; part).</p>



<p>&#8220;You next,&#8221; reads the top reply to Travis&#8217; comment (which, according to <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14143187/taylor-swift-fans-travis-kelce-reaction-josh-allen-hailee-steinfeld-engagement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, racked up thousands of likes within just a couple of hours).</p>



<p>Hundreds of Swifties echoed the sentiment, with some of them coming off a bit bully-ish with their pressure to propose.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see you,&#8221; one follower added. &#8220;Trav, your move,&#8221; a third chimed in. &#8220;You wish that was you huh?&#8221; a fourth rather snarkily inquired.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-taylor-and-travis">What&#8217;s Next For Taylor and Travis?</h2>



<p>Obviously, talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor and Travis getting engaged</a> is nothing new. And many Taylor fans are convinced that Travis has already popped the question.</p>



<p>Whether or not that&#8217;s true, scrutiny of the situation is sure to intensify now that one of Taylor&#8217;s famous friends is headed for the altar.</p>



<p>Perhaps Tay and Trav will make an announcement this offseason. Or maybe they&#8217;ll just continue to move at their own pace without the slightest concern for what a bunch of strangers on social media think of their relationship!</p>



<p>Whatever the case, we&#8217;d like to offer our congratulations to Hailee and Josh! The way he&#8217;s playing this season, the MVP candidate might be sporting <em>two</em> new rings come 2025!</p>

<p>Actress Hunter King is about to live the dream of every Swiftie.</p>



<p>Her new movie, <em>Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story</em>, premieres on the Hallmark Channel on November 30.</p>



<p>And as you might have guessed, it&#8217;s inspired by the romance between <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/travis-kelce-living-with-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hunter-king-says-upcoming-film-pays-tribute-to-taylor-swift">Hunter King Says Upcoming Film Pays Tribute to Taylor Swift</h2>



<p>The film might not have the official endorsement of Taylor and Travis, but fans will surely recognize that it was conceived with the A-list couple in mind.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s even a cameo from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/donna-kelce-breaks-silence-on-sons-romance-with-taylor-swift-its-a-lot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donna Kelce</a>!</p>



<p>Hunter plays a lifelong Chiefs fan who wants to win the team&#8217;s Fan of the Year contest. The judge? The Chiefs&#8217; director of fan engagement (and Hunter&#8217;s new love interest), played by Hallmark veteran <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/tyler-hynes-talking-with-the-hallmark-heartthrob-with-a-heart-of-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Hynes</a>.</p>

<p>“As the pair spends time together, it’s clear there’s a spark between them but when her grandfather’s vintage Chiefs good-luck winter hat goes missing, Alana begins to doubt everything she believed about fate, destiny and even questions her future with Derrick – unless, that is, a little Christmas magic can throw a Hail Mary,” reads a synopsis from Hallmark.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-chiefs-story-that-anyone-can-enjoy">A Chiefs Story That Anyone Can Enjoy</h2>



<p>“Whether or not you’re a Chiefs fan, I think you’ll be able to relate to this movie in some capacity,” Hunter tells <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/holiday-touchdowns-hunter-king-says-film-has-nods-to-taylor-travis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>.</p>



<p>“I feel like there’s just subtle little nods to things [related to] Travis and Taylor. </p>

<p>&#8220;Taylor fans might like, like, [Tyler’s] last name in the movie. There’s just certain, like, little tiny Easter eggs, as we’ll call them, that I think they’ll have fun hunting for.”</p>



<p>“I think that their love story has inspired the world in a lot of ways and it’s something that everybody’s kind of rooting for,&#8221; Tyler chimes in.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think there’s a feeling within that that’s certainly captured in the movie. Even though we’re not tackling that storyline head-on, it feels like we’re getting the best of it all. </p>



<p>&#8220;We’re telling a multi-generational story that feels very Hallmark and feels very inviting for anybody from any walk of life to join in.”</p>

<p>“I love the script. I love how centered around family and tradition it was. I am so, so close with my grandma and getting to read the script and see the relationship that my character had with her grandparents, I just absolutely loved that,&#8221; Hunter continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was so inspiring to me and felt so true to my own life.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-and-travis-holiday-plans">Taylor and Travis&#8217; Holiday Plans </h2>



<p>As for the real-life couple who inspired the flick, it seems that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/taylor-swift-skipping-thanksgiving-donna-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor and Travis will be spending Thanksgiving apart</a> this year.</p>

<p>They both have rather busy schedules this time of year, what with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/taylor-swift-break-after-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor wrapping up her historic Eras Tour</a> and Travis trying to lead the Chiefs to a third straight Super Bowl.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re sure they&#8217;ll be able to make time for one another as the holiday season kicks into high gear.</p>



<p>And hopefully, they&#8217;ll get a chance to check out <em>Holiday Touchdown</em>!</p>

<p>Soon, we could see Travis Kelce living with Taylor Swift as the Eras Tour finally comes to an end. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s the saying about a door closing, window opening?</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/travis-kelce-amsterdam-appearance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis has cheered on Taylor</a> and even participated in some of her concerts, his focus is currently on football.</p>



<p>That hasn&#8217;t stopped him from renovating his still-very-new mansion.</p>



<p>Is Travis upgrading his digs for himself &#8212; or for <em>Taylor </em>ahead of her planned move-in?</p>

<p>In 2023, Travis Kelce purchased a mansion in a Kansas City gated community.</p>

<p>Just recently, Travis Kelce has been making renovations to this Kansas City mansion. Specifically, he has been updating the kitchen.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s a DIY job. Travis is an expert at football, so he has used some of the millions that he makes on the field to pay experts in kitchen renovations to do that work while he follows Taylor Swift on the European leg of her Eras world tour.</p>



<p>Now, Travis is in the midst of a stellar season with the Chiefs, while Taylor is playing her final shows of her worldwide extravaganza. Two years, it&#8217;s hard to believe she&#8217;s finally calling it done. </p>

<p>Now, as Travis has been hitting the field with Kansas City Chiefs, his football team, Taylor has been more than once spotted seated and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-kansas-city-chiefs-games-24-25-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">watching him play</a> from the stands. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/taylor-swift-preparing-to-move-in-with-travis-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by <em>Life &amp; Style</em>, Taylor Swift has likely be living at Travis&#8217; mansion during Chiefs home games.</p>



<p>&#8220;She’s had the time of her life performing all over the world,&#8221; the inside source dished. &#8220;But is looking forward to just <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-nesting-between-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nesting</a> during her tour’s two-month hiatus.&#8221;</p>

<p>“She can’t wait to root Travis on at Kansas City Chiefs home games and&nbsp;really focus on him,&#8221; the source emphasized. </p>



<p>The insider added how nice it will be for Taylor to be living with Travis &#8220;without having one foot out the door.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-the-rennovations-because-travis-kelce-will-be-living-with-taylor-swift">Are the rennovations because Travis Kelce will be living with Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>According to the report, “He has done what he can to make his house feel like home to her &#8212; even upgrading the kitchen because she loves to cook for him and their friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Travis Kelce has previously quipped that Taylor Swift &#8220;makes a great pop-tart and cinnamon roll.&#8221; That sounds less like praise of someone&#8217;s culinary acumen and more like a joke.</p>



<p>The same source alleged: “Friends say this downtime is exactly what Taylor needs and won’t be surprised if it&nbsp;leads up to a wedding.&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-travis-kelces-wedding-plans-could-they-be-hitched-by-years-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sure, why not</a>.</p>

<p>According to insiders, Taylor Swift is taking personal responsibility for Travis Kelce&#8217;s weight and overall physical condition.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/taylor-swift-skips-chiefs-game-travis-looked-miserable-whats-going-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelce has struggled a bit on the field this season</a>.</p>



<p>His Kansas City Chiefs are currently the only undefeated team in the AFC, but Kelce has not been his usual dominant presence in any of their four games.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2170226233-3-1024x682.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce attend the men's final match between Italy's Jannik Sinner and USA's Taylor Fritz on day fourteen of the US Open tennis tournament at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City, on September 8, 2024.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, with star wide receiver Rashee Rice possibly out for the season, Kelce will need to step his game up if the Chiefs hope to continue their winning streak.</p>



<p>And Taylor intends to help him do exactly that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-wants-to-help-travis-kelce-lose-weight">Taylor Swift Wants to Help Travis Kelce Lose Weight</h2>



<p>Many observers have unfairly concluded that Taylor is the cause of Travis&#8217; current struggles.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with Taylor Swift after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on January 28, 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland." class="wp-image-510457" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968515022-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with Taylor Swift after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on January 28, 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some have even gone so far as to claim that Chiefs coach Andy Reig might <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/is-travis-kelce-benched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bench Travis because of Taylor</a>.</p>



<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s absurd. But according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/taylor-swift-on-mission-to-help-travis-kelce-get-back-in-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>, Taylor is determined to silence the haters by helping Travis leave his hard-partying ways behind him.</p>



<p>“All the commentators are saying that he partied like a monster during offseason, and he’s only got himself to blame for being out of shape and out of form,” one source says.</p>



<p>“Taylor and Travis both insist it’s being blown out of proportion, but there’s no doubt Taylor feels a little guilty that it’s gotten to this point because it is true that he spent his offseason living the good life with her,&#8221; the insider adds.</p>

<p>“Even after training camp he was off his diet and partying with her and her friends because that’s what she wanted to do.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-taylor-diet">The Taylor Diet</h2>



<p>According to the insider, Taylor is “now making it her mission to help him shed the weight and get his six-pack back so that he can have all the haters eating their words.”</p>



<p>“She’s promised to go on the diet with him for support, at least when they’re together,” the source adds. “That means all the junk food is out, no sugar, and definitely no drinking.”</p>
