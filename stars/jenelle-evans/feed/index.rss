<p>Jenelle Evans is sort of in mourning.</p>



<p>This past Thursday, the Teen Mom alum&#8217;s estranged sister, Ashleigh, revealed on Facebook that her and Jenelle&#8217;s father had passed away in December after a battle with lung cancer.</p>



<p>The 37-year old has not seen her dad in 18 years, while Jenelle did not have a relationship with him, either.</p>

<p>Ashleigh learned about the death from her mother just this week &#8212; while she added in a subsequent Facebook message that her infamous sibling was annoyed that she broke this news to the public.</p>



<p>“I’ll be going to be off-line for a little while,” Ashleigh wrote. </p>



<p>“Unfortunately my sister [Jenelle] is starting strife between the family and I’ve chose to block them out again because it’s better to protect your heart and my mental health and deal with her drama… </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m having a lot of hard feelings and mixed emotions about [our father’s death]. It’s very unsettling, very upsetting. My sister does not understand everybody grieves differently. </p>



<p>&#8220;My brother and I are very upset with her. She’s very selfish and cares about herself.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jenelle-evans-fires-back-at-estranged-sister-shes-toxic-and-jealous/">Jenelle does not get along with Ashleigh</a>. This has been known for awhile.</p>



<p>&#8220;What she did yesterday was very hurtful and uncalled for,” Ashleigh continued of Jenelle, explaining that she and their brother Colin plan to discuss the situation in an upcoming YouTube/social media video.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know for certain just what was said between the alleged loved ones.</p>



<p>Robert Evans never appeared on Teen Mom and reportedly didn&#8217;t even know his child was a reality star until a reporter from Star Magazine called his sister (Jenelle&#8217;s aunt) in 2011.</p>



<p>“He was shocked — there was total silence on the phone,” Jenelle’s aunt told the tabloid at the time. “He clearly was stunned by what’s happened.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="525" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510955" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-768x504.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans is on the phone in this Teen Mom scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In her 2017 book, &#8220;Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom,&#8221; Jenelle talked about her father and wrote that she hoped to reestablish a relationship with him &#8230; one day.</p>



<p>“Robert Evans was only in my life for a little while. For that short and glorious time, I was daddy’s little girl,” Jenelle wrote way back then. </p>



<p>“I loved and admired him. I still do in some way. Without warning everything changed, and my dad cut himself out of my life…Even now, as a grown woman, we don’t talk. Maybe one day that will change. </p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe one day we can find one another, get to know each other, and he can finally be my father. Until then, he is just my biological dad.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2021, Jenelle said on a podcast that her dad had a drinking and a cocaine problem.</p>



<p>In 2016, Radar Online conducted an interview with Robert, who said he had no idea how to get in touch with Jenelle or her siblings.</p>



<p>“They don’t call me,” he said of his kids. </p>



<p>“They don’t get in touch with me…Yeah I would probably like to get in contact with her. If she wants to get ahold of me, my number is in the phone book. She can call me anytime she wants.”</p>



<p>Robert was married to Jenelle and Ashleigh’s mom, Barbara, from 1984 through 1996.  </p>



<p>Evans has claimed that she lost touch with her dad entirely after she moved to North Carolina with Barbara and her siblings at the age of 12.</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans leveled quite the serious allegation against David Eason.</p>



<p>As you likely know by now, Evans finally split from her violent husband back in March, stating at the time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Eason was a deadbeat dad and a drunk</a>.</p>



<p>Now, however, via a recording from a recent divorce hearing during which Evans spoke in further detail about Eason and their marriage… the Teen Mom 2 alum has said something even more damning.</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="899" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1024x899.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1024x899.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-768x674.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-2048x1798.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-960x843.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1080x948.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1200x1054.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason and Jenelle Evans attend the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (GETTY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, you can actually <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/11/08/exclusive-audio-hear-former-teen-mom-star-jenelle-evans-accuse-her-estranged-husband-david-eason-in-court-of-having-items-related-to-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor/">watch a tearful Evans testify</a> that she found memory cards from Eason&#8217;s phone that she says contained materials related to the “<strong>sexual exploitation of a minor</strong>.&#8221;</p>



<p>No other details are provided.</p>



<p>However, Evans accuses Eason of not being fit to be around their daughter, Ensley, and asks that he is kept away from her until he undergoes a “psychological evaluation.”</p>



<p>The judge <em>does</em> award Jenelle temporary legal and physical of the seven-year at the end of the hearing, although the allegations about Eason having child sex exploitation materials are not addressed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans went on to say that filed a police report back when she made this discovery &#8212; and then, on social media, Jenelle wrote that she had reported what she had supposedly found to “police, FBI and custody court.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say at the moment just where any kind of investigation stands.</p>



<p>In the wake of her divorce filing, Evans has moved to Las Vegas.</p>



<p>But the drama with Eason isn&#8217;t finished, as security cameras caught in a short while ago breaking into the property he formerly shared with his wife in North Carolina and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/david-eason-caught-on-camera-breaking-into-exs-home-trying-to-steal-all-kinds-of-stuff/">trying to take back some of his stuff</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elsewhere, but relatedly it seems, Kenleigh Heatwole is dating Eason for some reason right now.</p>



<p>Shortly after Jenelle&#8217;s bombshell audio went public, she wrote the following on Instagram:</p>



<p>“Playing victim in situations they’ve created and then flip the story to manipulate people to think they are innocent.&#8221;</p>



<p>In another reel, Heatwole said she felt the same way as a person who thought:</p>



<p><em>Me trying to decide if I’m gonna stay calm or if I’m about to undo all my personal growth and say the most horrible things that will stay with them forever.</em></p>

<p>Eason himself has not yet responded to his ex-wife&#8217;s latest accusations.</p>



<p>For her part, though, Kenleigh recently defended herself against those wondering why the heck she was dating some such as David Eason.</p>



<p>“He’s a lot sweeter than people portray him to be,” she insisted during an Instagram Live session.</p>

<p>As you are likely very much aware by now, Jenelle Evans is going through a divorce. </p>



<p>She has finally made the sound decision <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jenelle-evans-this-is-why-i-finally-left-david-eason/">to leave husband David Eason</a>, a pretty well-known racist, homophobe and generally violent individual.</p>



<p>It may be one of the only intelligent moves Evans has ever made.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, in the wake of this plan to legally split from her spouse, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/12848581/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-onlyfans-tiktok-salaries-revealed-divorce/">The Sun has obtained</a> various financial documents  that give us an idea of just how much Evans is worth.</p>



<p>And the amount may blow your mind.</p>



<p>Over two weeks, from July 17 to July 29 of this year, the 32-year earned a total of $16,222 in Only Fans payments alone.</p>



<p>Put it all together from this summer and Evans took in a shocking $44,486.36 in the span of just two months &#8212; via OnlyFans on its own.</p>

<p>In her divorce filing, the Teen Mom 2 alum has asked for primary physical custody if her and Eason&#8217;s only daughter, Ensley, 8.</p>



<p>Evans has mostly made news of late, however, for the challenges facing her teenage son, Jace.</p>



<p>The troubled young man has run away from home on numerous occasions&#8230; most recently in late October.</p>



<p>This incident followed an alleged argument between <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-calls-911-on-son-loses-custody-of-jace-again/">Jace and Jenelle that even resulted in a 911 call</a>.</p>



<p>In a recording of this call, Jenelle told an operator she thinks her son smokes weed, and that he “drinks behind my back,” adding that her teenager’s alleged drug use played a part in causing their fracas the day before… in addition to Jenelle confiscating his pocket knife.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="525" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510955" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-768x504.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans is on the phone in this Teen Mom scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans and Eason, meanwhile, have had quite a contentious marriage.</p>



<p>Back in 2019, Jenelle told authorities that her husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/jenelle-evans-911-call-released-david-eason-broke-my-collar-bone/">beat her and broke her collarbone</a>, only to later recant this statement.</p>



<p>A short time later, Eason admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/">murdering the family dog</a>, which resulted in Child Protective Services conducting an investigation and taking away Jenelle&#8217;s kids for about a month.</p>



<p>In May, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-granted-restraining-order-against-violent-bigoted-husband/">Evans took out a restraining order</a> against Eason.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In March 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Evans finally called it quits</a>.</p>



<p>“Throughout the duration of the marriage of the parties, the defendant has exhibited concerning and at times disturbing behavior towards the plaintiff,” she wrote in her legal documents back then.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in this filing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Evans referenced the felony charge</a> hanging over her estranged spouse, which was the result of an alleged assault of her son, Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle writes, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, Evans alleges that Eason often acts in an “erratic” manner because he drinks so heavily, writing:</p>



<p><em>Defendant has committed marital misconduct in that he excessively uses alcohol and has not maintained consistent full-time employment for a number of years, has recklessly spent the party’s money which plaintiff solely earns, and in other ways to be shown at trial.</em></p>



<p>These two just really need to stay as far away as possible from each other.</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans moved halfway across the country to escape her problems, but it seems that they followed her all the way to Sin City.</p>



<p>Yes, as we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jenelle-evans-announces-move-to-las-vegas-says-she-lives-in-fear-of-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle recently moved to Las Vegas</a> with her three kids.</p>



<p>But just a few months later, two of those kids are no longer living with her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-s-struggles-in-vegas">Jenelle&#8217;s Struggles In Vegas</h2>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-grandmother-amid-domestic-violence-scandal-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her son Kaiser was sent to live with his grandmother</a> in Tennessee.</p>

<p>In August, Jenelle&#8217;s fortunes took another turn for the worse when boyfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-doesnt-deny-beating-the-crap-out-of-her-boyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August Keen accused her of domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>August later retracted his claim (even though Jenelle never denied hitting him) and the couple probably began to believe that they&#8217;d put the whole mess behind them.</p>

<p>“So, my girlfriend’s drunk and I’m trying to go home, but I want to grab my stuff,” Keen tells police in the footage.</p>



<p> &#8220;Then she started getting into the threatening sh-t. So, I called the cops. I just want to protect myself. I just want to grab my sh-t and go to my house.</p>

<p>“She did [hit me]. But there’s nothing wrong with me, and she does have kids,” he continues.</p>



<p>From there, August claims that he and Jenelle “have a great relationship”— but he concedes that she “used to be an alcoholic.”</p>



<p>“She used to go to alcohol classes. She had a few drinks…” he tells the cop.</p>

<p>“We’re in a serious relationship. We raise these kids,” August explained to the police. (At that time, all three of Jenelle&#8217;s kids were still living with her.)</p>



<p>From there, he claimed that he and Jenelle had been together “about two-and-a-half years.”</p>

<p><em>Teen Mom</em> fans were quite taken aback by August&#8217;s claim that he and Jenelle have been together for several years.</p>



<p>After all, it was just earlier this year that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle finally left David Eason </a>after years of abuse allegations.</p>



<p>Is August suggesting that Jenelle cheated on David for <em>years</em>? Or was he just making things up in an effort to convince the cops that the situation was more stable than it seemed?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s old is very unfortunately new again for Jenelle Evans and her oldest child.</p>



<p>Over this past weekend, the former Teen Mom participant reportedly called 911 after getting into a major fight with her 15-year old son, Jace.</p>



<p>According to The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, Jace ran away from home on Saturday night… only to return a few hours later.</p>

<p>(Last year, as many readers likely know at this point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/jenelle-evans-taunts-mom-after-son-runs-away-again-future-of-jace-more-unclear-than-ever/">Jace ditched home on numerous occasions</a>.)</p>



<p>On Sunday morning, mother and son engaged in a &#8220;nasty fight,&#8221; the aforementioned website claims, with Evans telling the 911 operator that Jace had &#8220;smashed his door, my door, a closet door.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now everything in my house is, like, smashed, and it keeps happening and the cops said they wouldn’t help yesterday [when Jace ran away the first time],” Jenelle says tearfully on the recording of this call.</p>



<p>Later in the call, Jenelle says she thinks Jace smokes weed, and that he “drinks behind my back,&#8221; adding that her teenager&#8217;s alleged drug use played a part in causing their fracas the day before&#8230; in addition to Jenelle confiscating his pocket knife.</p>



<p>Jace supposedly acting up in this manner in front of Jenelle&#8217;s daughter, Ensley, and son, Kaiser, the latter of whom Evans only recently brought back from Tennessee after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-grandmother-amid-domestic-violence-scandal-report/">trying to hand him off to his grandmother</a>.</p>

<p>In a subsequently police incident report filed on Sunday &#8212; which has been obtained by our friends at The Ashley &#8212; Jenelle told cops that Jace screamed &#8220;f-ck you bitch!&#8221; in her face and proceeded to break her kitchen cabinets.</p>



<p>We aren&#8217;t quite certain where things stand right now, but &#8220;Jace has since been removed from Jenelle’s home and has not been back since last weekend,&#8221; The Ashley writes, emphasizing that it &#8220;can confirm Jace is safe, but will not be going back to Jenelle’s home for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just to crazy and just so awful. <em><strong>Again</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Jenelle&#8217;s mother, Barbara, raised Jace until March 2023 &#8212; at which time she signed over custody to Evans, who was living back then with now-estranged husband David Eason in North Carolina.</p>



<p>However, Jace then ran away on two separate occasions.</p>



<p>He <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/david-eason-physically-assaulted-jace-evans-police-report/">also accused Eason of assault</a>.</p>



<p>Following that incident, Jace was placed in the custody of Child Protective Services, although he stayed briefly with Barbara and was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/jace-evans-where-the-heck-is-jenelles-son-living-right-now/">in a number of facilities as well</a>. </p>



<p>It wasn’t until February of this year that Jenelle regained custody of Jace. Shortly thereafter, she separated from Eason and moved with her children to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Jenelle has not yet commented publicly on the 911 call or the altercation with her son.</p>



<p>We often make fun of the MTV personality and we may continue to do so. But the bottom line is this:</p>



<p>Evans is clearly troubled and so is Jace and we truly wish nothing but the best for him.</p>

<p>The drama continues for Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>Over the past several days alone, we&#8217;ve reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-again/">Evans has been cut from Teen Mom</a> once again&#8230; and also that she has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-grandmother-amid-domestic-violence-scandal-report/">sent one of her kids away</a> to live with his grandmother.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile, we appear to have evidence that her estranged husband, David Eason, broke into her home on Sunday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="945" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1024x945.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1024x945.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-768x709.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-960x886.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1080x997.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1200x1108.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862.jpg 1903w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans and David Eason attends the 2016 MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros.

<p>Based on surveillance footage from Jenelle&#8217;s home in North Carolina, Eason, his girlfriend and three others cut off the locks to this property on Sunday night using bolt-cutters.</p>



<p>They proceeded to load up a number of motorcycles and other items from Jenelle&#8217;s garage and place them inside of a trailer.</p>



<p>TMZ has <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/22/jenelle-evans-claims-ex-david-eason-broke-into-property/">actually obtained footage</a> from this attempted robbery, which was brought to Jenelle&#8217;s attention thanks to an alert from her Ring camera system.</p>



<p>According to both TMZ and also The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, Eason brought a local deputy with him as an escort, who was under the impression that Eason was permitted to pick up these vehicles and items.</p>

<p>Evans is currently residing in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>As part of her divorce proceedings from Eason, she has taken out an order of protection against her often-violent ex.</p>



<p>The Ashley writes that Evans was “screaming via the Ring camera” at the on-scene officer to make it clear that Eason was <em><strong>not</strong></em> allowed to take any of the bikes, tools and/or pieces of yard equipment that were being swiped “right in full view of the cameras.”</p>



<p>The Ashley’s insider said that Jenelle then called the Sherriff’s Office and spoke to a Sergeant.</p>



<p>Once he was forced to put everything back, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/10/22/david-eason-attempt-break-into-jenelle-evans-home-on-the-land-nearly-gets-arrested-for-trying-to-take-motorbikes-exclusive-details/">Eason got into an argument</a> with the deputy and, naturally, &#8220;narrowly avoided getting arrested,&#8221; this source adds.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="525" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510955" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-768x504.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans is on the phone in this Teen Mom scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Eason and Evans are scheduled to come face-to-face next month for a hearing in regard to their divorce.</p>



<p>Earlier this summer, on an episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-again/">Evans referred to Eason</a> as &#8220;mentally abusive&#8221; and also told Briana DeJesus:</p>



<p>“He would throw objects, put holes in walls,&#8221; explaining of her move to Nevada:</p>



<p>“I feel like so much stuff has happened that it’s like, ‘I’ve got to get out and relocate and get that fresh start, leave all the bad memories behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alas, it sort of feels like there will never be an end to this saga, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Stop us if you&#8217;ve heard this before, but&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; Jenelle Evans has been let go by the producers of Teen Mom.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The polarizing cable network personality appeared on a few episodes this past season <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-returns-to-teen-mom-franchise-following-david-eason-split/">of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a></em>, but our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup are now reporting that she will NOT be asked back in 2025.</p>



<p>“It kind of came out of nowhere,” <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/10/21/exclusive-jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-next-chapter-heres-how-it-went-down/">one production source told</a> this celebrity gossip website, adding on Monday: </p>



<p>“There had even been a concerted effort to get [Jenelle’s mother] Barbara Evans out to film, because they know that the fans really wanted to see Barb again. Barbara had almost agreed to film, and then [MTV] pulled out.”</p>



<p>As is so often the case, of course, there&#8217;s been a whole lot of drama surrounding Jenelle of late.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="525" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510955" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-768x504.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans is on the phone in this Teen Mom scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just last week, insiders confirmed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-grandmother-amid-domestic-violence-scandal-report/">Evans had sent son Kaiser away</a> from live with his grandmother &#8212; not long after Evans herself relocated from North Carolina to Las Vegas.</p>



<p>This news came directly on the heels of Jenelle&#8217;s boyfriend having placed a call to 911 because he alleged Evans had been taking drugs and hitting him.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-doesnt-deny-beating-the-crap-out-of-her-boyfriend/">Evans did not exactly dispute</a> either of these charges against her.</p>



<p>Interestingly, however, Evans has NOT been released from her deal with the MTV production company Viacom.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="478" height="349" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/86106773-13528655-image-a-16_1718335684135-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-502019" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/86106773-13528655-image-a-16_1718335684135-copy.jpg 478w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/86106773-13528655-image-a-16_1718335684135-copy-300x219.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans opens up to Teen Mom: The Next Chapter viewers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Jenelle signed a contract, and even if [MTV] chooses not to film her anymore, she is still locked into that contract,” the insider explained to The Ashley. “That means Jenelle would not be allowed to appear on any other shows or anything like that, due to the non-compete clause in the contract she signed.”</p>



<p>Evans, as you likely recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/">was fired by MTV back in 2019</a> after her estranged husband, David Eason, shot and killed the family dog.</p>



<p>As a result of this heinous action, Child Protective Services conducted an investigation and even took away the then-couple&#8217;s children for about a month.</p>



<p>To her credit, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jenelle-evans-this-is-why-i-finally-left-david-eason/">Evans finally left Eason</a> a few months ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="534" height="356" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/86106537-13528655-The_32_year_old_reality_star_told_Briana_how_she_was_looking_for-a-6_1718373306844-copy.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter" class="wp-image-502017" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/86106537-13528655-The_32_year_old_reality_star_told_Briana_how_she_was_looking_for-a-6_1718373306844-copy.jpg 534w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/86106537-13528655-The_32_year_old_reality_star_told_Briana_how_she_was_looking_for-a-6_1718373306844-copy-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the aforementioned source, Evans made around $25,000 per episode last season&#8230; not exactly an insignificant figure.</p>



<p>“It’s a significant financial loss, because Jenelle wasn’t the only one making money from her segments,” The Ashley writes. “Her kids were each being paid when they appeared, too.” </p>



<p>As for why Evans was let go?</p>



<p>It may have been Jenelle&#8217;s desire for her boyfriend and manager, August Keen, to be included on next season.</p>



<p>“Having August be a ‘boyfriend’ really took away from the whole redemption arc they wanted to show Jenelle having,” this source says. </p>



<p>“They wanted to show her living life as a single mom, away from David and being with her kids. But showing August as her boyfriend and not just her manager would have kind of killed that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans has reportedly sent her son Kaiser to live with his grandmother in Tennessee.</p>



<p>The move comes on the heels of an incident in which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-doesnt-deny-beating-the-crap-out-of-her-boyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle was accused of committing an act of violence</a> against her boyfriend, August Keen.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no reason to believe that the two occurrences are related. But it seems that Jenelle&#8217;s life in Las Vegas may not be as tranquil as she previously led fans to believe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-s-new-life">Jenelle&#8217;s New Life</h2>



<p>As you may recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jenelle-evans-this-is-why-i-finally-left-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle filed for divorce</a> from her estranged husband, David Eason, earlier this year.</p>



<p>She has since been granted a restraining order against David, and she says she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jenelle-evans-announces-move-to-las-vegas-says-she-lives-in-fear-of-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved from North Carolina to Las Vegas</a> in part for the safety of her children.</p>



<p>All of this makes Jenelle&#8217;s decision to send Kaiser to Tennessee even more surprising.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-flies-cross-country-with-one-son-leaves-other-kids-at-home">Jenelle Flies Cross-Country With One Son, Leaves Other Kids at Home</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/10/14/exclusive-jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-his-grandmother-in-tennessee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>, Jenelle joined Kaiser on the flight to Tennessee.</p>



<p>Her two other children remained at home in August&#8217;s care.</p>



<p>“Jenelle flew with Kaiser to [Tennessee] recently,” an insider tells The Ashley.</p>



<p>“Kaiser is not able to go to his school in Vegas any longer, so Jenelle sent him [to Doris’]. He is supposed to stay there until school gets out for summer break at least.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Needless to say, summer is quite a long way away. And it seems that Kaiser was unaware that his trip would be a long-term one.</p>



<p>According to The Ashley&#8217;s source, the nine-year-old was not informed that he would be living with his grandmother until after he and Jenelle had arrived in Tennessee. </p>



<p>“He was upset,” says the insider.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-kaiser-situation">The Kaiser Situation</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why Kaiser is not able to attend school in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>Curiously, the boy&#8217;s father, Nathan Griffith, is currently living in Vegas, as well.</p>



<p>After numerous brushes with the law, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/nathan-griffith-breaks-silence-following-arrest-for-strangling-sister-yeah-im-kind-of-a-piece-of-sh-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan is in a court-ordered rehab program</a> in Nevada.</p>



<p>His mother reportedly hopes that he&#8217;ll be able to join his son in Tennessee upon his release.</p>

<p>The former reality star was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/nathan-griffith-pleads-guilty-to-strangling-his-sister-will-the-former-teen-mom-star-finally-go-to-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested for strangling his sister</a> last year.</p>



<p>So yeah, it sounds as though Jenelle is still living quite an eventful life.</p>



<p>We obviously hope that she and her sons and daughter are safe and healthy in their new David-free lives.</p>



<p>And we also sort of hope that MTV offers her a new reality show because she clearly has a whole lot going on!</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans swears she isn&#8217;t violent.</p>



<p>At least not any time in the recent past at least.</p>



<p>The often-beleaguered reality star gave a statement late last week to Celebuzz in which she sought to downplay an apparent incident over the summer between herself and boyfriend August Keen.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In case you missed it, Keen called 911 in August and told the operator &#8212; according to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup &#8212; that Evans had “been hitting” him “all night,” and that she was drunk after consuming a eight to 12 drinks over the past several hours.</p>



<p>Keen added that, in general, his girlfriend has been smoking “a lot of weed and drinking a lot.”</p>



<p>Evans can be heard screaming in the background of this call, which reportedly took place after she and Keen returned from a pool party.</p>



<p>(Jenelle, remember, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jenelle-evans-announces-move-to-las-vegas-says-she-lives-in-fear-of-david-eason/">moved to Las Vegas from North Carolina</a> earlier this year.)</p>

<p>“I’m trying to walk away but she keeps following me,” Keen says on this 911 call. “I just want to get outta the house safe.”</p>



<p>Police eventually arrived at August&#8217;s residence, but he chose NOT to press any charges.</p>



<p>In a subsequent Instagram Story, Keen tried to walk back his allegations.</p>



<p>“No I was not hit. I have zero tolerance for violence and would not stick around any DV situations,” he told followers.</p>



<p>“My intentions were to never get any of us in trouble,” he wrote. “On the contrary. I highly respect and love [Jenelle] very much.”</p>

<p>Evans, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">left her own abusive relationship in March</a>, told the following to Celebuzz over the weekend:</p>



<p>“Me and August have been best friends for so many years. We have argued less then 5 times within 7-8 years. Our bond is so much stronger then one bad night.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t help but note the lack of any sort of denial here when it comes to Keen&#8217;s original accusations.</p>



<p>“That night is far behind us and we&#8217;re just focused on future possibilities,&#8221; Evans simply added in this new message.</p>

<p>Previously, via his social media statement, Keen said everything had been blown out of proportion:</p>



<p>“We had a good time at a friend’s event, end of night we jumped in an uber, had a disagreement on the way to her house. I wanted to be escorted out with some of my stuff, I don’t like alcohol, because in heated moments, things can escalate.”</p>



<p>Keen said he was just referring to &#8220;anxiety&#8221; medication when he references pills on the call and concluded:</p>



<p>“And FYI no children were around at any point. I think if the police saw anything fishy, they would have done there job.”</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans has left North Carolina for a new life in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>The troubled reality star announced her plans to move to Sin City during this week&#8217;s episode of <em>T<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/amber-portwood-leah-kristina-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">een Mom: The Next Chapter</a></em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-evans-reveals-intention-to-move-to-las-vegas">Jenelle Evans Reveals Intention to Move to Las Vegas</h2>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-returns-to-teen-mom-franchise-following-david-eason-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle was fired from the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise</a> in 2019, it was largely due to David&#8217;s violent behavior.</p>



<p>Now that he&#8217;s out of the picture, she&#8217;s been permitted to return to the show that made her famous.</p>



<p>The Vegas bombshell came during a confessional in which Jenelle spoke candidly about her efforts to protect herself and her kids from her unstable ex.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="696" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-840011444-696x1024.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans attends the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.

<p>&#8220;I think Vegas is definitely gonna be a space &#8212; life my safe haven and definitely a good safe haven for my kids. There&#8217;s just so much to look forward to for this move to Vegas,&#8221; Jenelle said.</p>



<p>&#8220;So much has happened in North Carolina, it&#8217;s just traumatized all of us in different ways,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>But despite her eagerness to set up her new life in Nevada, Jenelle was forced to return to North Carolina for a court date with David.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to be here. But this week, I have a court case for a pending restraining order, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes,&#8221; she explained in a voice-over.</p>

<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel safe when I&#8217;m in North Carolina, because I don&#8217;t know if or where I can run into David.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s just capable of intimidating me. I feel harassed. I feel stalked. Now, every white truck on the highway, I&#8217;m staring at, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s him,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-s-fight-for-freedom">Jenelle&#8217;s Fight For Freedom</h2>



<p>Over the course of her marriage, Jenelle took a lot of flak for defending <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jenelle-evans-this-is-why-i-finally-left-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David&#8217;s abusive behavior</a> toward children and animals.</p>

<p>Now, however, it appears that her actions were at least partially motivated by fear.</p>





<p>&#8220;My nerves are shot. I keep having panic attacks,&#8221; Jenelle told the camera.</p>



<p> &#8220;I keep thinking how I have to go on stand. It&#8217;s just all very scary. And I&#8217;m like, shaking. But I gotta do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sick of feeling this way. And even though he&#8217;s not here, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m still walking on eggshells, which sucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following the hearing, Jenelle revealed to castmate Briana DeJesus that she was granted a six-month <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-granted-restraining-order-against-violent-bigoted-husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restraining order against David</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;All these fears in my head are just poof, gone now,&#8221; said a triumphant Evans.</p>



<p>Jenelle was recently spotted partying on the Las Vegas strip, so we guess the move went well.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s taken some criticism for leaving her kids at home to go out clubbing. But hey &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t be Jenelle if she weren&#8217;t stirring up controversy!</p>
