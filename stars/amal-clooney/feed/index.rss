<p>Have Meghan Markle and Prince Harry been snubbed by the Clooneys?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-tailor-comes-forward-with-final-word-on-infamous-wedding-dress-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry&#8217;s 2018 wedding</a> was the social event of the year, with A-list stars and dignitaries from across the globe in attendance.</p>



<p>Among the celebrities on hand were George and Amal Clooney, who had developed a close friendship with the Sussexes in the months after they announced their engagement.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the two couples have drifted apart in recent years.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the fact that they now live on separate continents, or maybe there was some sort of secret falling out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-vs-the-clooneys">Harry and Meghan vs. the Clooneys</h2>



<p>For unknown reasons, the Clooneys allegedly failed to invite Harry and Meghan to the third annual Albie Awards.</p>



<p>The Clooney Foundation for Justice in New York City hosted the star-studded event in September of 2024.</p>



<p>George and Amal left the couple off the guest list despite the fact that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/prince-harry-prince-williams-nyc-run-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry was in Manhattan</a> that week to attend the Clinton Global Initiative Summit. In other words, he easily could&#8217;ve attended.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="787" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1447258326-2-1024x787.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attend the 2022 Robert F.

<p></p>



<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that this was the second straight year the duke and duchess were MIA at the event.</p>



<p>Sources say the Sussexes were stunned when the Clooneys didn&#8217;t invite them to the star-studded soiree in 2023.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the snubs they&#8217;ve had to deal with since their move to Hollywood, this is probably the most hurtful [to Harry and Meghan],&#8221; one insider told the <em>National Enquirer</em> (<a href="https://radaronline.com/p/prince-harry-meghan-markle-humiliated-snubbed-george-amal-gala/">via</a> Radar Online). </p>

<p>&#8220;George and Amal went from being their wedding guests and trusted confidants to totally ghosting them.&#8221;</p>



<p>As an actress, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-was-humiliated-by-spotify-firing-insider-claims/">Meghan likely encountered her fair share of rejection</a>, but this sort of snub is probably new to Harry.</p>



<p>And it seems that the Sussexes are not taking it well.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="720" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-1024x720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-483901" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-1024x720.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-768x540.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-1536x1080.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-2048x1440.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-735x517.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-335x236.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-347x244.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-520x366.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-640x450.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-960x675.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1682251014-1080x760.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend the cycling medal ceremony at the Cycling Track during day six of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 15, 2023 in Dusseldorf, Germany. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-left-reeling">Harry and Meghan Left Reeling</h2>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge kick in the teeth and a massive embarrassment they can&#8217;t really explain or wrap their heads around,&#8221; the insider added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The gala would have been a dream event for the two, but George and Amal knew only too well the circus that follows them would have ruined it for others.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, the first snub came at a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-is-strategizing-her-hollywood-reinvention-with-a-new-pr-team-is-the-duchess-getting-desperate-for-a-comeback/">Harry and Meghan were attempting to rebuild their public image</a> following a string of bad press.</p>

<p>Being spotted at an A-list charity event would&#8217;ve provided exactly the sort of boost that Harry and Meghan needed to help them reclaim their place at the top of the global celebrity totem pole.</p>



<p>The situation comes as a shock, as the Clooneys previously spoke quite highly of the Sussexes.</p>



<p>&#8220;We live not too far from one another and we have dinners and stuff and we&#8217;re friends with them for all the reasons that you&#8217;re friends with anybody,&#8221; George told the <em>Daily Mail</em> in 2020.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just really nice, fun, kind people, they&#8217;re a very loving couple, and they&#8217;re going to be great parents.&#8221;</p>



<p>We may never know exactly what caused the two couples to drift apart.</p>



<p>But with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/george-clooney-divorce-actor-and-wife-living-separate-lives-source-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce rumors circulating around George and Amal</a>, the Clooneys might have decided to shrink their social circle in an effort to sidestep unnecessary drama.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s possible that as UK residents, George and Amal have decided that their loyalty lies with the Windsors.</p>

<p>According to a troubling new report, the romantic clock may be ticking on one of Hollywood&#8217;s most beloved couples.</p>



<p>Yes, we&#8217;re looking at you, George Clooney and Amal Clooney.</p>



<p>But we really wish we were not.</p>

<p>Via<em> In Touch</em>, a source claims that the Oscar-winning actor and his extremely intelligent wife simply don&#8217;t see each other very often these days.</p>



<p>“They are both hardcore workaholics, so it’s like they’re in their own little bubble. They are in two very different worlds 90 percent of the day. They’re leading separate lives,&#8221; this <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/george-and-amal-clooney-are-leading-separate-lives/">insider tells the tabloid</a>, noting that at least the spouses seem to be aware of their issues.</p>



<p>The couple reportedly hoped that the situation would improve when George relocated to New York City to star in a Broadway show.</p>



<p>Amal is often in the Big Apple as well due to her job as an adjunct professor at Columbia University. Alas, life in Manhattan did not prove any more conducive to a healthy marriage.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="749" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-749x1024.jpg" alt="George Clooney and Amal Clooney on a red carpet" class="wp-image-501876" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-749x1024.jpg 749w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-219x300.jpg 219w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-768x1050.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-1497x2048.jpg 1497w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-702x960.jpg 702w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-790x1080.jpg 790w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-877x1200.jpg 877w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1828868291-scaled.jpg 1872w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">George Clooney and Amal Clooney attend &#8220;The Boys In the Boat&#8221; UK Special Screening at the Curzon Mayfair on December 3, 2023 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Joe Maher/Getty Images for Warner Brothers)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, George and Amal are preparing for their longest separation yet. According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/george-amal-clooney-prepare-to-be-separated-amid-broadway-stint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>, he&#8217;ll spend the next six months in Manhattan, performing in <em>Good Night &amp; Good Luck</em>, while she remains home with their kids.</p>



<p>“George has never done Broadway before, and he’s thrilled about the opportunity, but between rehearsals and performances, it means he will spend six months in NYC,” an insider tells the outlet.</p>



<p> “Amal is going to remain in France, where their two children are settled in &#8212; and there’s no denying this is going to test their 10-year marriage.”</p>



<p>The source says that past lengthy separations &#8220;didn’t do the marriage much good,” but George and Amal have developed a strategy for coping with the long-distance arrangement.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-1024x683.jpg" alt='George Clooney and Amal Clooney attend "The Tender Bar" Premiere during the 65th BFI London Film Festival at The Royal Festival Hall on October 10, 2021 in London, England.' class="wp-image-515788" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1345875971-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">George Clooney and Amal Clooney attend &#8220;The Tender Bar&#8221; Premiere during the 65th BFI London Film Festival at The Royal Festival Hall on October 10, 2021 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for BFI)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“George will be able to speak to the kids every night before bedtime, taking the time difference into consideration. And Amal might be able to fly out for the occasional weekend visit,&#8221; the insider explains.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time we&#8217;ve written about trouble in marital paradise for the Clooneys.</p>



<p>There was a rumor back in 2020 that the couple was separated and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/george-and-amal-clooney-separated-for-months-headed-for-divorce/">headed for a divorce</a>, but nothing came of it.</p>



<p>The latest reports refrain from dropping the D-Word, instead focusing on two people who are very successful in their fields &#8230; and the toll that can take on a relationship.</p>



<p>“George runs his filmmaking operation — from directing and producing to taking acting roles in other people’s projects — like a military general,&#8221; <em>In Touch</em> explains, detailing how Clooney has directed a movie (<em>The Boys in the Boat</em>), filmed two movies (one with Brad Pitt and one with Adam Sandler) and produced numerous projects over the past few years.</p>



<p>Amal, meanwhile, is a human rights attorney.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-1024x683.jpg" alt="Amal Clooney and George Clooney" class="wp-image-501875" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1706917087-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amal Clooney and George Clooney attend the Clooney Foundation For Justice&#8217;s &#8220;The Albies&#8221; on September 28, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>She is &#8220;often traveling back and forth for work, which can become chaotic,” says this source, noting that Amal spends a lot of time in London working with clients or in Netherlands, where the International Criminal Court is located.</p>



<p>Adds the magazine:</p>



<p>&#8220;She’s doing so much around the world that most people don’t even know about. Her career will never take a back seat to George’s career, and she made that clear to him very early on.”</p>



<p>When they aren&#8217;t traveling for work, George, Amal and their seven-year-old twins spend time as a family in Clooney&#8217;s famous Lake Como villa.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a positively gorgeous place. But there&#8217;s a production facility inside of the mansion where Clooney frequently works, leaving little downtime for him and his wife to truly connect.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="872" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-1024x872.jpg" alt="George Clooney and Amal Clooney in DC" class="wp-image-501874" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-1024x872.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-300x256.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-768x654.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-2048x1745.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-960x818.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-1080x920.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1446779554-1200x1022.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Honoree George Clooney and Amal Clooney attend the 45th Kennedy Center Honors ceremony at The Kennedy Center on December 4, 2022 in Washington, DC. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Adding to the stress is the fact that the Clooneys have become influential in the world of politics. During the 2024 US presidential election, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/george-clooney-celebrities-against-president-biden-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">George called for Joe Biden not to seek reelection</a>.</p>



<p>And he may have been instrumental in the sitting president&#8217;s decision to step aside.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, rumors circulated that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/meghan-markle-prince-harry-reportedly-humiliated-after-being-snubbed-by-george-and-amal-clooney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were devastated</a> over being &#8220;snubbed&#8221; by the Clooneys. That sort of clout can take a toll on a couple.</p>



<p>“They seem like the picture of bliss on the red carpet, and of course they always gush about each other in public, but friends are wondering if they’ll make it,&#8221; the source continues. &#8220;A lot of Hollywood couples don’t.&#8221;</p>



<p>Heck, a lot of couples <em>period</em> do not.</p>



<p>Due to the age of their kids, along with Clooney&#8217;s fortune (he sold his Casamigos Tequila company for $1 billion in 2017), going through a divorce would be a &#8220;nightmare,&#8221; this report concludes.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s all hope it never comes to that.</p>
