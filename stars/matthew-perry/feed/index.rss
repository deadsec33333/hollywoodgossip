<p>Matthew Perry&#8217;s mother believes that the late <em>Friends</em> star had a &#8220;premonition&#8221; about his own death.</p>



<p>As you probably recall <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/matthew-perrys-final-words-revealed-heart-shattering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew passed away</a> last year after being found unresponsive in a hot tub at his home.</p>



<p>It was later revealed that he had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overdosed on ketamine</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matthew-perry-s-long-struggle">Matthew Perry&#8217;s Long Struggle</h2>



<p>Perry had battled addiction throughout his adult life. But fans were under the impression that he had been sober for several years.</p>



<p>He even penned a bestselling memoir about his struggles with substance abuse and mental health issues.</p>



<p>Alas, the medical professionals in charge of his treatment believed it would be prudent to address his addiction issues with more drugs.</p>



<p>Several of them are now <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/matthew-perry-overdose-arrests-made-in-connection-with-actors-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing criminal charges</a>. More on that later.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matthew-perry-s-mother-believes-he-predicted-his-own-death">Matthew Perry&#8217;s Mother Believes He Predicted His Own Death</h2>



<p>Given the circumstances of his passing, it&#8217;s not hard to believe that Matthew knew he was in danger.</p>



<p>Next week will mark one year since Matthew&#8217;s passing, and his mother, Suzanne Morrison, observed the sad occasion by opening up to <em>Today</em> show host Savannah Guthrie.</p>









<p>“He went through a period, interestingly enough, just before he died when he was showing me one of his new houses,” Morrison recalled (via <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/25/celebrity-news/matthew-perry-had-premonition-before-death-mom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>).</p>



<p>“He came up to me, and he said, ‘I love you so much, and I’m so happy to be with you now.’ … It was almost as though it was a premonition or something.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="549" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-1024x549.png" alt="Matthew Perry's mother, Suzanne Morrison, appears on the Today show." class="wp-image-511941" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-1024x549.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-300x161.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-768x412.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-2048x1098.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-960x515.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-1080x579.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-25-at-4.04.08-PM-1200x644.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Perry&#8217;s mother, Suzanne Morrison, appears on the Today show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (NBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Morrison added that she “didn’t think” much of her son’s remakes at the time, though she did find them, unusual.</p>



<p>“‘How long has it been since we’ve had a conversation like that? It’s been years,&#8217;” she thought at the time.</p>



<p>“I think there was something; there was an inevitability to what was going to happen next to him, and he felt it very strongly,” Suzanne added. “But he said, ‘I’m not frightened anymore,’ and it worried me.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-justice-in-the-wake-of-grief">Justice In the Wake of Grief</h2>



<p>The full interview won&#8217;t air until Monday, which is the anniversary of Perry&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>So we don&#8217;t know if Suzanne will address the ongoing legal controversy surrounding her son&#8217;s death.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/matthew-perry-death-investigation-underway-where-did-the-actor-get-his-ketamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five people have been charged</a> in connection with Matthew&#8217;s passing, including two doctors.</p>



<p>“Mr. Perry fell back into addiction, and these defendants took advantage to profit for themselves,&#8221; US Attorney Martin Estrada said in a recent statement, according to <a href="http://US Attorney Martin Estrada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, more and more information has emerged in regard to the death of Matthew Perry last October.</p>



<p>And each tidbit has been more heart-breaking than the one before.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we learned that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/matthew-perry-overdose-arrests-made-in-connection-with-actors-death/">multiple arrests had been made</a> in conjunction with the actor&#8217;s death because he obtained ketamine from from doctors and drug dealers without a prescription.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="889" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-1024x889.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-507358" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-1024x889.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-300x261.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-768x667.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-2048x1779.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-960x834.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-1080x938.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-3284492-1200x1042.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Perry appears on &#8220;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&#8221; at the NBC Studios on April 8, 2004 in Burbank, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We then learned that Perry&#8217;s own assistant, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/matthew-perry-assistant-kenneth-iwamasa/">Kenneth Iwamasa</a>, had injected the beloved actor on the day he died.</p>



<p>Now, according to newly-released court documents obtained by NBC News and published on August 16, Perry reportedly asked his assistant Kenneth Iwamasa for help administering the drug three times on this date.</p>



<p>Referring to this drug, the Friends alum asked Iwamasa to “shoot me up with a big one.”</p>



<p>By all accounts, these are the final words Perry said to anyone before his overdose.</p>

<p>Perry was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home on October 28&#8230; with his cause of death later determined to be &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-autopsy-report-reveals-cocktail-of-substances-in-system/">acute effects of ketamine</a>&#8221; via a drowning-related accident.</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t the first time Perry experienced negative effects of the dissociative anesthetic. </p>



<p>Perry had an &#8220;adverse medical reaction&#8221; to an at-home ketamine injection on October 12, prosecutors said in these same, recenetly-unsealed documents.</p>



<p>Attorneys say now that Dr. Salvador Plasencia (who has been arrested) injected the 54-year-old with &#8220;a large dose&#8221; of the controlled substance at the request Iwamasa (who has also been charged in the case) after the actor had already undergone ketamine infusion therapy from a doctor&#8217;s office.</p>



<p>The latter procedure was legally prescribed; the former was not.</p>



<p>The Department of Justice states the at-home ketamine caused a &#8220;significant spike&#8221; to Perry&#8217;s systolic blood pressure, making him &#8220;freeze up&#8221; so much that he &#8220;could not speak or move.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more, too:</p>



<p>While the aforementioned three injections led to Perry’s death in October, Iwamasa has claimed he administered 27 total in the final five days of Perry’s life. </p>



<p>(For the record, Iwamasa does not have any medical training and was following instructions laid out by Plasencia.)</p>



<p>Iwamasa &#8212; who discovered Perry&#8217;s body &#8212; has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death, per authorities.</p>



<p>Relatedly, Plasencia is facing one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, seven counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of altering and falsifying documents or records related to the federal investigation. </p>



<p>He has not publicly entered a plea.</p>

<p>Perry struggled with substance abuse for many years, but those close to the actor believed him to be clean at the time of his passing.</p>



<p>The star detailed his battle in the memoir “Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir,” in which Perry focused a great deal of his energy on using his experience to help others stay clean and sober.</p>



<p>Wrote Warner Bros. in a statement about the comedic actor after his death:</p>



<p>“We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry. Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family.</p>



<p>“The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many.</p>



<p>“This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.”</p>

<p>In May, we reported that an investigation was underway to determine how beloved actor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/matthew-perry-death-investigation-underway-where-did-the-actor-get-his-ketamine/">Matthew Perry had acquired the ketamine</a> that played a significant role in his tragic death last October.</p>



<p>We now have an update on this investigation.</p>



<p>According to TMZ, multiple arrests have been made in connection with Perry&#8217;s fatal overdose several months ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="792" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-1024x792.jpg" alt="A Matthew Perry photo" class="wp-image-507230" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-1024x792.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-300x232.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-768x594.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-2048x1584.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-960x743.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-1080x836.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-72788087-1200x928.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Perry at the after party for the FX Network&#8217;s premiere screening of &#8220;Dirt&#8221; at Republic on December 9, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The aforementioned website states that at least one doctor and one drug dealer are now in custody.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/15/matthew-perry-arrests-ketamine-death-investigation/">arrests were made</a> after law enforcement officials in Los Angeles executed search warrants and seized computers, phones and other electronic equipment to determine who supplied Perry with the drug that caused him to lose consciousness in October and drown in his hot tub in his Pacific Palisades home.</p>



<p>There are reportedly texts messages between one of the individuals arrested and Perry in which the sides discuss how much the latter is willing to pay for ketamine.</p>



<p>For those who recall the horrible incident&#8230;</p>



<p>Perry <em>had</em> been receiving ketamine infusion therapy for anxiety and depression; however, his latest therapy was a week and a half <em>prior</em> to his death, meaning the ketamine in his system via autopsy was NOT doctor-prescribed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="832" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-832x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-507231" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-832x1024.jpg 832w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-244x300.jpg 244w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-768x945.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-1664x2048.jpg 1664w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-780x960.jpg 780w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-877x1080.jpg 877w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-477291056-975x1200.jpg 975w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Perry attends Phoenix House&#8217;s 12th Annual Triumph For Teens Awards Gala at the Montage Beverly Hills on June 15, 2015 in Beverly Hills, California.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 54-year old Friends alum suffered from addiction for many years, including throughout most of his stint on this iconic NBC sitcom.</p>



<p>An autopsy report last year concluded that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-officially-revealed/">Perry passed away from acute effects</a> of ketamine. </p>



<p>Other contributing factors included drowning, coronary artery disease and effects from buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid use disorder.</p>



<p>To his extreme credit, Perry wrote candidly about his substance abuse battle in the memoir <em>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</em>.</p>

<p>“I wanted to share when I was safe from going into the dark side again,” Perry told People Magazine for a 2022 cover story. </p>



<p>“I had to wait until I was pretty safely sober &#8212; and away from the active disease of alcoholism and addiction &#8212; to write it all down. I was pretty certain that it would help people if I did.”</p>



<p>Perry also cited his ketamine infusions while in a Swiss rehab clinic during the Covid-19 pandemic in this same book.</p>



<p>“Ketamine was a very popular street drug in the 1980s. There is a synthetic form of it now, and it’s used for two reasons: to ease pain and help with depression,” he said, adding: </p>



<p>“Has my name written all over it — they might as well have called it ‘Matty.’“</p>

<p>In the wake of Perry&#8217;s death, his former co-stars have shared a number of tributes to their close friend.</p>



<p>&#8220;He visits me a lot, if we believe in that,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/courteney-cox-confesses-matthew-perry-visits-her-after-his-death/">Courteney Cox said of Perry</a> on the May 19 episode of CBS Sunday Morning. </p>



<p>&#8220;I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew. I feel like there are a lot of people that guide us. I sense Matthew&#8217;s around for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued at the time of her onscreen romantic partner:</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s probably one of the funniest human beings in the world. He is genuinely a huge heart &#8212; obviously struggled. I&#8217;m so thankful I got to work so closely with him for so many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>As you very much know by now, Matthew Perry is no longer with us.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/matthew-perry-death-certificate-released-what-does-it-say/">beloved actor died in October</a> at the young age of 54.</p>



<p>However, TMZ now confirms that questions remain about the basis for this tragedy&#8230; with local authorities in California telling the celebrity gossip website that there&#8217;s an ongoing investigation into Perry&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>The Friends cast member, who was candid for many years after his lengthy struggle with substance abuse, <strong>died from the acute effects of ketamine</strong>.</p>



<p>His body was discovered in a hot tub on his property in Pacific Palisades by the star&#8217;s assistant.</p>



<p>Following a 911 call, paramedics arrived on the scene and declared Perry dead before even taking him to the hospital.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all very sad, and now we&#8217;re learning more that it&#8217;s also at least a little bit shady and/or confusing.</p>

<p>According to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office, Perry had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for Depression and anxiety more than a week before his death.</p>



<p>HOWEVER, this same department concluded the ketamine in Perry&#8217;s system when he died was NOT from the treatment.</p>



<p>Enter this investigation.</p>



<p>The police are the DEA have been looking for months into just who supplied Perry with the drug that took his life, having even &#8220;interviews some key people in Hollywood,&#8221; <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/05/21/cops-investigating-matthew-perry-death-origins-ketamine/#continued">TMZ reports</a>.</p>



<p>Most of these individuals have some kind of history with drug use.</p>

<p>Just this week, meanwhile, Courteney Cox said on an installment of CBS This Morning that she still thinks about Perry.</p>



<p>&#8220;He visits me a lot, if we believe in that,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/courteney-cox-confesses-matthew-perry-visits-her-after-his-death/">Cox said on this program</a>. &#8220;I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew. I feel like there are a lot of people that guide us. I sense Matthew&#8217;s around for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cox, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc were notably very close throughout their decade-long run as stars on the smash hit sitcom Friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful that I had that opportunity to work with such wonderful people and to live the life that I have now,&#8221; Cox also told CBS on May 19. &#8220;That was my family. We went through everything. Those 10 years were everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shortly after Perry&#8217;s unexpected death last year, Cox used her Instagram page to share memories of spending to much time with him on the set of Friends.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you work with someone as closely as I did with Matthew, there are thousands of moments I wish I could share,&#8221; she wrote alongside a clip of the par filming their first scene together as a romantic couple. </p>



<p>&#8220;To give a little backstory, Chandler and Monica were supposed to have a one night fling in London. But because of the audience&#8217;s reaction, it became the beginning of their love story.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking to CBS, the actress concluded on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matthew-perry-beloved-friends-star-dead-at-54/">this tragic topic</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, he’s just so funny. He has genuinely a huge heart, obviously struggled. I’m so thankful I got to work so closely with him for so many years. He visits me a lot, if we believe in that.”</p>

<p>In a moving new interview, Courteney Cox shared her feelings about her late <em>Friends</em> costar Matthew Perry.</p>



<p>As you likely recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/matthew-perry-death-certificate-released-what-does-it-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew passed away</a> in October of 2023 at the age of 54.</p>



<p>His lifelong struggle with substance abuse had been well documented, but those who knew him best say that the troubled star retained his kind heart and generous spirit to the very end.</p>

<p>And no one knew that more than Courteney.</p>

<p>“You know, he’s just so funny. He has genuinely a huge heart, obviously struggled,” she said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/courteney-cox-friends-homecourt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS Sunday Morning</a></em>.</p>



<p>“I’m so thankful I got to work so closely with him for so many years. He visits me a lot, if we believe in that.”</p>



<p>Courteney used the present tense in referring to Matthew, a reflection of her belief that he&#8217;s still with her in spirit.</p>

<p>She went on to reveal that she believes several departed loved ones watch over her.</p>



<p>“You know, I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew — I feel like there are a lotta people that, I think, guide us,” said Cox. </p>

<p>The <em>Friends</em> cast was famously close-knit, and all of the show&#8217;s stars were reportedly devastated by Matthew&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>In a statement to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/friends-stars-mourn-matthew-perry-after-his-death-at-age-54/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> at the time, the cast wrote that they were &#8220;all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew.&#8221;</p>



<p>“We were more than just cast mates. We are a family,” they continued, adding:</p>



<p>“In time, we will say more, as and when we are able… For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”</p>

<p>An autopsy later revealed that he was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under the influence of ketamine</a> at the time of his death.</p>



<p>Perry made no secret of his struggles with addiction. But fans were under the impression that he had been sober for several years.</p>

<p>Despite growing up in a family with several famous members, Matthew Perry&#8217;s siblings have mostly managed to steer clear of public scrutiny.</p>

<p>He was just 54 years old.</p>



<p>The stars of <em>Friends</em> received record salaries during the show&#8217;s heyday, and Perry died a very wealthy man.</p>



<p>As a result, there&#8217;s been a great deal of curiosity regarding the terms of his will.</p>

<p>While many of the details have been kept under wraps, it looks as though Perry&#8217;s loved ones will be well taken care of.</p>



<p>“All my personal and household effects, including, but not limited to, jewelry, furniture and furnishings, works of art and automobiles, together with any insurance on such property, shall pass as part of my residuary estate,” Perry wrote, according to court documents obtained by <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matthew-perrys-will-names-half-siblings-as-beneficiaries-of-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>.</p>



<p>That estate contains the majority of the cash in assets possessed by Perry at the time of his death.</p>

<p>In addition to the millions in assets willed to his estate, about $1 million in &#8220;additional assets&#8221; is being held in a trust named after Woody Allen&#8217;s character in the 1975 comedy <em>Annie Hall</em>.</p>

<p>These include his mother&#8217;s children from her marriage to Keith Morrison of <em>Dateline</em> fame: Caitlin Morrison, Emily Morrison, Madeline Morrison, and William Morrison.</p>

<p>Perry has another half-sibling, 32-year-old Maria Perry-Bowick, whom his father welcomed with his second wife, Debbie Boyle.</p>



<p>Matthew is the only child of John and Suzanne, who divorced one year after his birth.</p>



<p>Perry never had children, but his will includes a clause stating that any kids he might have had after 2009 should not be entitled to his fortune simply by virtue of being his offspring.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This may have been a safeguard against bogus paternity claims.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-autopsy-report-reveals-cocktail-of-substances-in-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Perry passed away</a> in October of last year, tributes poured in from all over the world, as fans united in grief for a performer who battled through his own pain to make millions laugh.</p>



<p>On social media, friends, family, and a legion of devoted fans shared fond memories of the actor&#8217;s life and praise for his beloved body of work.</p>



<p>So it came as quite a surprise when Perry&#8217;s death went unacknowledged during one of the entertainment industry&#8217;s most prestigious award shows.</p>



<p>The 2024 BAFTAs were held last night, and as is customary, the event featured an &#8220;in memoriam&#8221; segment paying tribute to the stars who have passed away in the past year.</p>

<p>For reasons that have not yet been made clear, Perry was not one of the stars who was memorialized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matthew-perry-snubbed-fans-speak-out">Matthew Perry Snubbed: Fans Speak Out</h2>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter), viewers were quick to lash out at the show&#8217;s producers.</p>



<p>“Shame on you @BAFTA for not acknowledging @MatthewPerry #BAFTA2024,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/02/18/entertainment/friends-fans-saddened-after-matthew-perry-is-snubbed-from-baftas-in-memoriam-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a>, as first reported by Page Six.</p>

<p>“No mention of Matthew Perry in the #BAFTAs memorial?! Bad form @BAFTA,&#8221; another added.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-was-perry-left-out">Why Was Perry Left Out?</h2>



<p>BAFTA producers have not responded to the uproar over Perry&#8217;s omission.</p>



<p>They may apologize at some point, but it&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;ll ever offer an explanation for the choice.</p>



<p>Most award show memorial segments contain a controversial &#8220;snub&#8221; or two, and producers are usually reluctant to illuminate their reasoning.</p>

<p></p>



<p>There are many possibilities in the case of Perry.</p>



<p>It could have been left out because the BAFTAs are a celebration of the British film and television industries, and Perry was a Canadian actor known almost entirely for his work on American television.</p>



<p>(Of course, <em>Friends</em> was a worldwide cultural phenomenon, with many fans in the UK.)</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the sitcom star was omitted as a result of recent controversies regarding his final days. </p>



<p>One report alleged that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/matthew-perry-sobriety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry was still using drugs</a> and engaging in abusive, reckless behavior right up until the end of his life.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/matthew-perry-in-memoriam-friends-cast-emmys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry has been featured in several memorial segments</a> during the current award season, and we&#8217;re sure his memory will live on in the hearts of his most devoted fans.</p>

<p>The Matthew Perry in memoriam segment was a touching moment during the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/emmy-awards-7-memorable-moving-omg-worthy-moments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emmy Awards</a>. But why weren&#8217;t <em>Friends </em>cast members there for it?</p>



<p>Late last October, beloved actor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matthew-perry-beloved-friends-star-dead-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Perry died at home</a>. It was a tragedy.</p>



<p>He was one of the most memorable celebrity deaths of 2023. He has been a household name for <em>decades</em>.</p>



<p>Many have likened the <em>Friends </em>cast to being like a family. So why weren&#8217;t they present?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-memoriam-segments-honor-actors-who-have-passed-like-matthew-perry">In Memoriam segments honor actors who have passed, like Matthew Perry</h2>



<p>Emmys producers spoke to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> this week about why <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/emmy-producers-interview-reunions-mama-doris-in-memoriam-1235789800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Friends </em>cast did not receive invitations</a> to the 75th Annual Emmy Awards.</p>



<p>Yes, the tribute to the late Matthew Perry might have felt even more meaningful with them present.</p>



<p>But according to Emmys Executive Producer Jeannae Rouzan-Clay, &#8220;It&#8217;s still very fresh for them.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="677" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-1024x677.jpg" alt="A photo of the Friends cast from an alternate  universe episode." class="wp-image-490595" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-768x508.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-1536x1016.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-2048x1354.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-735x486.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-335x222.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-347x229.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-520x344.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-640x423.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-960x635.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_07-1080x714.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Friends Special Episode, &#8220;The One That Could Have Been, Part One&#8221; From L-R: Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox Arquette And Matt Leblanc.

<p>Another EP, Jesse Collins, shared that they had &#8220;talked about&#8221; inviting the remainder of the <em>Friends</em> cast. However, they ultimately decided to try a more tasteful option.</p>



<p>“I can imagine, from their side, they’re mourning someone who was still very close to them,” Collins reasoned..</p>



<p>“I can’t speak for them, but we all have to respect that they were their own family,&#8221; Collins continued. &#8220;It was probably just a little too soon.”</p>

<p>Obviously, Perry was not the only tragic celebrity death this year. Andre Braugher, Frances Sternhagen, David McCallum, Lance Reddick, and so many more passed away.</p>



<p>The in memoriam segment paid tribute to many famous faces and lost talents while Charlie Puth sang &#8220;See You Again.&#8221;</p>



<p>The song transitioned into the <em>Friends </em>opening theme music, &#8220;I&#8217;ll Be There For You,&#8221; as a special nod to Perry.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>While that might seem like playing favorites, Collins reasoned that there were limits. One limit was not invitiing the <em>Friends </em>cast to the Matthew Perry in memoriam.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Norman Lear and Matthew Perry, you have to give some special attention to, but you don’t want anyone to feel slighted,&#8221; the EP explained.</p>



<p>Collins continued: “Everybody’s contribution was significant, and this is their moment inside this package.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matthew-perry-died-just-three-months-ago">Matthew Perry died just three months ago</h2>



<p>Perry passed away on October 28, 2023. The beloved actor was only 54 years old.</p>



<p>He was unresponsive at home in his private jacuzzi.</p>



<p>The medical examiner determined that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the primary cause of death</a> was the acute effects of ketamine.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-682x1024.jpg" alt="Matthew Perry in 2012." class="wp-image-490592" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-1023x1536.jpg 1023w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-1364x2048.jpg 1364w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0117_matthewperry_04-scaled.jpg 1705w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Perry speaks onstage during the 64th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A.

<p>The medical examiner ultimately discovered a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-autopsy-report-reveals-cocktail-of-substances-in-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cocktail of substances in Matthew Perry&#8217;s system</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to ketamine, which did not appear to be from a treatment program, he passed from drowning, coronary artery disease, and buprenorphine (an opioid).</p>



<p>For years, Perry&#8217;s struggles with sobriety defined his life. He spent millions attempting to become sober.</p>

<p>More than once, Perry expressed a desire that his own struggles with substance abuse would inspire and educate others.</p>



<p>Though some of those closest to him <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/matthew-perry-sobriety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described Perry&#8217;s sobriety as, at times, a &#8220;lie,&#8221;</a> he did become sober multiple times during his decades-spanning battle.</p>



<p>Addiction is complex and so are people. This means that Perry has a complex legacy, too &#8212; because he is human. The passing of Matthew Perry still warranted a special in memoriam, but we understand why the <em>Friends </em>cast was not part of it.</p>

<p>A sad and disturbing report describes Matthew Perry lying about his sobriety &#8212; and worse.</p>



<p>The late <em>Friends </em>star struggled for many years with substance abuse issues.</p>



<p>Given that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-autopsy-report-reveals-cocktail-of-substances-in-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry&#8217;s autopsy report included a deadly cocktail</a>, that struggle ultimately claimed his life.</p>



<p>But this report sheds new light on the ways that Perry&#8217;s inner turmoil impacted others. It describes him as allegedly once <em>attacking </em>a friend who confronted him.</p>

<p>Three separate anonymous sources spoke to <em>Us Weekly</em> in a story published Wednesday January 10, 2024 to allege that <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matthew-perrys-dark-side-abusive-behavior-lies-about-sobriety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Perry lied about his sobriety</a> and had a history of abusive behavior.</p>



<p>“He was verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive,” claimed one insider.</p>



<p>Describing him as a &#8220;manipulative&#8221; person, the source added: &#8220;All he knew how to do was cause pain and play the victim.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Matthew Perry in 2022." class="wp-image-490047" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0110_matthewperry_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Perry attends the GQ Men of the Year Party 2022 at The West Hollywood EDITION on November 17, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for GQ)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not all of the inside sources saw eye-to-eye on this, given their varying experiences (and assessments) of Perry.</p>



<p>A second insider declined to characterize Perry as a &#8220;horrible human being&#8221; as the first one had.</p>



<p>Instead, this second source described Perry as having been &#8220;warped&#8221; by his addiction.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addiction-and-recovery-became-matthew-perry-s-lifelong-struggle">Addiction and recovery became Matthew Perry&#8217;s lifelong struggle</h2>



<p>Though Perry&#8217;s greatest claim to fame remains <em>Friends</em>, much of his public brand relates to his decades-long struggles with substance abuse.</p>



<p>In October of 2022, the actor offered an estimate: he had spent $9 million trying to become sober, and had remained clean of all substances for about 18 months.</p>



<p>One year later, he passed away. Authorities uncovered a vast array of substances in his home, but did not locate any <em>illegal </em>substances (outside of his body, that is).</p>

<p>As for Perry&#8217;s system upon his death, the medical examiner&#8217;s report confirmed that he did not have fentanyl or meth in his system.</p>



<p>Instead, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Perry&#8217;s cause of death</a> was the &#8220;acute effects of ketamine.&#8221;</p>



<p>While ketamine has legal uses and Perry had spoken about past treatments, the ME&#8217;s office indicated that it appeared to be recreational.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-friends-immediately-suspected-his-cause-of-death">Friends immediately suspected his cause of death</h2>



<p>One of the sources notes that Perry&#8217;s inner circle immediately suspected his cause of death when the news broke.</p>



<p>“Everybody close to Matthew was saying he died from an overdose,” this insider reported.</p>



<p>Supposedly, his close friends knew that he would habitually &#8220;isolate&#8221; himself. Furthermore, they did not believe that he&#8217;d properly dealt with underlying mental health issues.</p>

<p>According to the first source, Perry had &#8220;crashed his Aston Martin many times while high&#8221; as his substance abuse issues rampaged unchecked.</p>



<p>“He just damaged the car and no one was hurt,&#8221; the insider continued, &#8220;[but] he did not consider [that] he could have killed someone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just for the record, there is no official record of any accidents that is available to the public. So we cannot confirm those allegations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matthew-perry-allegedly-attacking-a-friend-is-much-more-serious">Matthew Perry allegedly attacking a friend is much more serious</h2>



<p>Another allegation described Perry as having gotten into a physical confrontation with Morgan Moses. Moses was a close friend and is also an addiction expert.</p>



<p>“He threw [Moses] into a wall and threw something at her and shoved her onto a bed,” one insider described. Allegedly, this happened in March 2022, a time in which Perry&#8217;s self-reported timeline portrayed him as sober.</p>



<p>Perry allegedly told Moses that &#8220;If I wanted to hurt you, I would have.&#8221; The source says that he was known to have violent outbursts towards objects &#8212; punching walls, overturning furniture &#8212; as well.</p>

<p>The second insider, who also described the confrontation, described Perry as feeling remorseful and &#8220;mortified&#8221; after the fact.</p>



<p>“He was panicking because the person who was always by his side had left him,” this more sympathetic source explained.</p>



<p>“Morgan was his best friend, and he burned that to the ground. He pushed her to her absolute breaking point,&#8221; the insider characterized. &#8220;He would get pissed off about little things and then flip the narrative about what really happened to make himself the victim.”</p>



<p>Morgan has not made an official statement yet confirming or denying the claims. </p>

<p>When Jennifer Aniston worked the red carpet ahead of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/taylor-swift-golden-globes-travis-kelce/">Sunday night&#8217;s Golden Globes</a>, it might&#8217;ve looked as though there was nothing particularly remarkable about the moment.</p>



<p>Aniston looked lovely, of course, but that&#8217;s nothing new, as she&#8217;s been stunning fans at award shows for decades now.</p>



<p>What made this occasion unique was the fact that it was the first time that Aniston had appeared at a red carpet event since the<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matthew-perry-beloved-friends-star-dead-at-54/"> death of Matthew Perry</a> in October of last year.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ll likely recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-revealed/">Perry drowned in a hot tub</a> at his home while under the influence of ketamine.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-friends-both-on-set-and-off">Friends Both On Set and Off</h2>



<p>Matthew and Jen enjoyed a very close friendship, and insiders say <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matthew-perry-cause-of-death-revealed/">Aniston has been &#8220;struggling&#8221; in the months since Perry&#8217;s passing</a>.</p>



<p>“Out of the remaining five, Jen and Courteney [Cox] are reeling the most,” one source told Page Six in November.</p>



<p>“And Jen is probably the one who is struggling most acutely.”</p>

<p>So there were doubts about whether or not Aniston would attend this years Globes ceremony at all, much less pose for photographers on the red carpet.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the star&#8217;s unexpected appearance and bubbly demeanor as she interacted with friends and fans came as a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>As one insider noted, Jen&#8217;s grief over Perry&#8217;s death was compounded by the fact that she lost her father, actor John Aniston, in November of 2022.</p>



<p>“It’s a second massive loss in less than a year,” the source noted.</p>



<p>The insider explained that Aniston was reeling at the time “with the one-year anniversary of her dad’s death just around the corner.” </p>

<p>“She still hasn’t fully regained her footing from that,” the source said. </p>



<p>“And now this has just completely knocked her off her feet. She is trying to regroup and recover but it’s been a completely devastating blow.”</p>



<p>In one of his final interviews, Perry noted that of all his famous castmates, it was Aniston who seemed most devoted to helping him through the darkest days of his addiction.</p>

<p>“She was the one that reached out the most. You know, I’m really grateful to her for that,” he told Diane Saywer just one year before he passed away.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Aniston will never fully recover from the loss of her close friend.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re equally certain that Perry would love to see that she&#8217;s putting on a brave face and getting back out into the world.</p>
