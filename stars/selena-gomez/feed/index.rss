<p>Though Selena Gomez appears to disparage ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber in her new album, that is not her focus.</p>



<p><em>He </em>is not her focus. Not anymore. She has a successful career <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/selena-gomez-engaed-to-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a fiance</a>.</p>



<p>But after Bieber&#8217;s latest post on social media, some fans wonder if part of him is still hung up on her.</p>



<p>Others are just focusing upon Selena&#8217;s first album in half a decade.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-has-a-new-album-full-of-sad-ballads-and-bops">Selena Gomez has a new album full of sad ballads and bops</h2>



<p>In Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&#8217;s joint album, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWJ8SWD7?crid=3DA491KS9Q1VM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.d3rBHPNRY2qlMVhXdcSrWo4kzP947HvYxklU30XYyjgvtYFvf7o6A4f0tEqMdGdDcz6R4UkuDEZUl_96NLDZUfTZZ2BerV2umD-I_sw58AbVdtVL4lffmElXYZfTLmr3mmA7ITwGdI0bKLa7pGVx_S7esIAWmal07g-QLqZsaG9qqqccrVC7tGAtBVhAVOEcvXPou5aZf9HJ3IdTHlYnnOMWeClC4FkoDu1KzqsAVIY.zHGS_8Yt629HHGaJT1AKeCRGQT_vKI43ZUVMpujmOSc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=selena+gomez+i+said+i+love+you+first+mp3&amp;qid=1742568381&amp;sprefix=%2Caps%2C121&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Said I Love You First</a></em>, the singer and her fiance have produced a solid set of tracks.</p>



<p>Even the strongest albums have some hits and some misses. But between <em>I Said I Love You First</em> and Lady Gaga&#8217;s <em>MAYHEM</em>, March 2025 has been a fantastic time for music. (And for television &#8230; and almost nothing else)</p>



<p>The first (actual) song on the album is &#8220;Young And Hotter Than Me,&#8221; an evocative ballad with palpable Lana Del Rey vibes. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;I used to feel like an angel/Now I&#8217;m a dog on your leash,&#8221; sends an unsubtle message. As does &#8220;We&#8217;re not gettin&#8217; any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.&#8221;</p>



<p>After concluding the song about the straying ex whom she wishes that she had &#8220;never loved&#8221; in the first place, Selena sings about falling back in with a former boyfriend in &#8220;Ojos Tristes.&#8221;</p>



<p>We should be leery of assuming that we know exactly what every song means. But gosh, it sure does sound like Selena Gomez is singing about moving on from Justin Bieber.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-delights-with-don-t-wanna-cry">Selena Gomez delights with &#8216;Don&#8217;t Wanna Cry&#8217;</h2>



<p>Critics are already celebrating &#8220;Don&#8217;t Wanna Cry&#8221; as a success &#8212; and a career highlight. Spring began on Thursday but <em>some </em>are calling it a contender for Song of the Summer. (That&#8217;s probably premature, and I say that as a diehard Selena fan)</p>



<p>“Now I found another hand to hold,” Selena Gomez sings, referring to moving on from Justin Bieber and other exes once she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/benny-blanco-fills-bathtub-with-nacho-cheese-as-valentines-day-surprise-for-selena-gomez-gross-or-romantic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found Benny Blanco</a>.</p>



<p>And yes, then comes &#8220;Sunset Blvd,&#8221; which is cheesy and horny and keeps threatening to discuss Blanco&#8217;s penis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Selena Gomez, benny blanco - Sunset Blvd (Official Video)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJG5CWsne8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Speaking of horny lyrics, &#8220;Cowboy&#8221; makes it clear why the album has &#8220;[Explicit]&#8221; in the title. The lyrics detail a lot of riding, and it&#8217;s not subtle.</p>



<p>In a similar vein is &#8220;Bluest Flame,&#8221; which really picks up about halfway through. Seriously, it&#8217;s like two different songs, and the second is a total bop. This song, too, is somewhat horny.</p>



<p>Selena Gomez once again seemingly shades Justin Bieber (and perhaps all exes) with &#8220;How Does It Feel To Be Forgotten.&#8221; The song is truly a taunt, but not an unfair one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-songs-are-about-her-romance-with-benny-blanco-but">Many songs are about her romance with Benny Blanco, but &#8230;</h2>



<p>In &#8220;You Said You Were Sorry,&#8221; Selena Gomez sings about an ex &#8212; possibly Justin Bieber &#8212; who did not apologize when he might have. While she&#8217;s happy to have moved on, she clearly wonders what might have been.</p>



<p>&#8220;I Can&#8217;t Get Enough&#8221; is more triumphant, with Selena singing about how she and Benny Blanco are totally wrapped up in each other.</p>



<p>Then, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Take It Personally&#8221; has a beautiful melody and lyrics that seem to blend empathy with ridicule. Selena is addressing a woman &#8212; perhaps her past self &#8212; going through relationship ups and downs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Selena Gomez, benny blanco - Don’t Take It Personally (Official Lyric Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKuuWOhJU-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The album concludes with &#8220;Scared of Loving You.&#8221;</p>



<p>This vulnerable song has Selena Gomez expressing to Benny Blanco that she fears that breaking up would be her undoing.</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re in a marriage, an engagement, a serious relationship, or discussing a serious friendship &#8212; this is the kind of fear of loss that cuts to the bone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-justin-bieber-just-respond-to-selena-gomez">Did Justin Bieber just respond to Selena Gomez?</h2>



<p>After Selena Gomez released &#8220;I Said I Love You First,&#8221; fans believe that they spied some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber shade</a>.</p>



<p>He posted a set of photos to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinbieber/p/DHcqO4fOXX_/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, one of which capturing his beautiful wife, Hailey Bieber.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s shade, it&#8217;s extremely subtle. Which is not, historically, Bieber&#8217;s vibe.</p>



<p>Perhaps we should all keep in mind that not everything is a veiled message to an ex. The odds are pretty good that some of Selena&#8217;s lyrics aren&#8217;t about <em>him</em>, either.</p>

<p>The rumored Hailey Bieber, Selena Gomez feud has a new twist.</p>



<p>It is no secret that some have been critical of, or at least bewildered by, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/selena-gomez-engaed-to-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena&#8217;s romance with Benny Blanco</a>.</p>



<p>Some have made fun of their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/benny-blanco-fills-bathtub-with-nacho-cheese-as-valentines-day-surprise-for-selena-gomez-gross-or-romantic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheesy moments</a> and of a recent, somewhat unsettling photoshoot.</p>



<p>Was Hailey Bieber one of them? She says that she isn&#8217;t &#8212; and that the alleged photo that claims otherwise is a total fabrication.</p>

<p>When Selena Gomez and fiance Benny Blanco did their <em><a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/benny-blanco-and-selena-gomez-against-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview Magazine</a></em> photoshoot earlier this year, they knew that people would talk.</p>



<p>People always talk. Especially when you&#8217;re famous. And especially when some of your photos seem a bit &#8230; cursed. You don&#8217;t put your feet on somebody&#8217;s face on camera if you don&#8217;t anticipate a reaction of some kind.</p>



<p>In the wake of the photoshoot, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@courtneypresto/video/7471426816926895391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> video roasted the series of photos. The TikTok creator, who admitted that she was &#8220;being a little shady&#8221; in the process, stated: &#8220;this is the WORST&#8221; about the somewhat cursed photoshoot.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>That same TikTok denizen went on to share a new video, which you can see below. In this video, she alleges that Hailey Bieber &#8220;liked&#8221; the Selena Gomez video.</p>



<p>“I feel like this is definitive proof that when Hailey Bieber is like, ‘Oh, it’s all love. It’s all good, we have absolutely no beef. Everything is completely fine,’ she’s lying,” the TikToker claimed.</p>



<p>In her estimation, the rumored one-way feud between Hailey and Selena is &#8220;alive and well.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-hailey-bieber-really-like-the-shady-video-that-roasted-selena-gomez">Did Hailey Bieber really &#8216;like&#8217; the shady video that roasted Selena Gomez?</h2>



<p>On Sunday, March 9, Hailey Bieber told <em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/09/celebrity-news/hailey-bieber-denies-liking-shady-video-about-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a></em> that she had not liked the video that criticized Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&#8217;s photoshoot.</p>



<p>&#8220;This never happened,&#8221; her rep alleged in a statement.</p>



<p>Sometimes, people &#8220;like&#8221; social media posts by accident, or as a way to bookmark them. That is not what happened here, Bieber&#8217;s rep explained.</p>

<p>“This entire story has been fabricated by a content creator,&#8221; Hailey Bieber&#8217;s rep said, accusing the TikTok user of faking the screenshot.</p>



<p>The rep went on to allege that the TikToker is merely &#8220;looking to capitalize off of an old, tired narrative.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some social media platforms make it very easy to determine who has given a &#8220;like&#8221; to a post. TikTok, among its many baffling flaws, only allows the video creator to see all of the likes. Which, among other issues, allows for people to make claims that others may dispute.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-feud-rumors-persist-whether-or-not-the-feud-actually-does">The feud rumors persist, whether or not the feud actually does</h2>



<p>Whatever did or did not happen on TikTok, the rumored one-way feud between Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez has worn thin.</p>



<p>In fact, at least one report alleged that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/selena-gomez-hailey-bieber-oscars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena avoided Hailey</a> at at the Oscars because she worried that any photo of the two of them might spawn a &#8220;story.&#8221; As it turned out, avoiding her created its own story.</p>



<p>Selena doesn&#8217;t want people to be mean to Hailey. How she feels about what some have characterized as Hailey <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/single-white-female/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-white-femaling</a> her is, frankly, her business. They&#8217;re both grown women with their own lives. It is unlikely that Selena lives rent-free in Hailey&#8217;s mind in the way that this alleged feud does in the minds of content creators.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber could have had an awkward run-in at the Oscars.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Academy Awards ceremony</a> was a night of fashion, honors, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/michelle-trachtenberg-in-memoriam-snub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remembrance</a>, and this one near miss.</p>



<p>Selena and Hailey don&#8217;t exactly have a feud. </p>



<p>But there may be just too many complexities between them for things to ever be normal.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez looks breathtaking at the 2025 Oscars on March 2." class="wp-image-520599" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-selena-gomez-carefully-avoid-hailey-bieber-at-the-oscars">Did Selena Gomez carefully avoid Hailey Bieber at the Oscars?</h2>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14455745/Why-Selena-Gomez-avoided-Justin-Biebers-wife-Hailey-Bieber-Vanity-Fair-Oscar-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, Selena Gomez was careful to adeptly sidestep any potential encounter with Hailey Bieber at the Oscars afterparty. But not for the dramatic reasons that some may assume.</p>



<p>“She just wanted to avoid being photographed with her or near her,&#8221; the report explained, &#8220;because then 100 stories are born.&#8221;</p>



<p>That same report acknowledged: &#8220;Selena took a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/selena-gomez-hailey-baldwin-pose-for-pic-send-important-message-to-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">picture with Hailey</a> in the past and it didn’t feel right.”</p>

<p>A follow-up report by <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/why-selena-gomez-avoided-hailey-bieber-at-vanity-fair-oscars-afterparty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em> alleges that Selena Gomez was focusing upon &#8220;self care&#8221; when she avoided a Hailey Bieber encounter.</p>



<p>“Selena looked gorgeous and felt amazing at the Oscars,&#8221; the insider affirmed. </p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; that same source emphasized, &#8220;she wasn’t going to let anything ruin her special night.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-selena-gomez-and-hailey-bieber-interact-people-talk">When Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber interact, people talk</h2>



<p>&#8220;She’s gotten a lot better at avoiding drama,&#8221; the insider added. It&#8217;s been over a year since the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-quits-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globes drama</a> from January 2024, but Selena clearly hasn&#8217;t forgotten.</p>



<p>&#8220;And that means falling into any traps that could cause any negative buzz or unnecessary anxiety for her,” the source spelled out.</p>



<p>“So yes, while she didn’t obsess about it, avoiding a potential Hailey Bieber viral moment was in the back of her head,&#8221; the insider explained. &#8220;It’s not always possible, but she’s learned to avoid potentially awkward moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she had bumped into her, she definitely would have said hello,&#8221; the source stressed about Selena Gomez&#8217;s attitude towards a potential Hailey Bieber run-in.</p>



<p>“Selena has nothing against Hailey,&#8221; the insider then assured. &#8220;That’s never really been her focus, and she’s certainly way over the long-standing trend of pitting women against each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source continued: &#8220;So, not putting herself in a situation like that is just about self-care and not giving haters any ammunition.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="701" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-701x1024.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez dazzles on March 2, 2025 for the Academy Awards." class="wp-image-520603" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-701x1024.jpg 701w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-206x300.jpg 206w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-768x1121.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-1403x2048.jpg 1403w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-658x960.jpg 658w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-740x1080.jpg 740w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-822x1200.jpg 822w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_selenagomez_03-scaled.jpg 1754w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nothing-but-good-vibes-all-around-apparently">Nothing but good vibes all around, apparently</h2>



<p>“She only wishes the best for Hailey, Justin and their new baby,&#8221; the inside source concluded. &#8220;Selena’s Oscar night was all about good vibes, celebrating her film <em>Emilia Pérez</em> and her costars, and the industry she loves.”</p>



<p>We do fully believe that Selena Gomez wishes Hailey Bieber and her family well. That sounds very believable.</p>



<p>At the same time, we have to acknowledge that we cannot confirm reports that she &#8220;avoided&#8221; Hailey. These Oscars parties can be very large. Sometimes, two people merely do not mingle at an event.</p>



<p>You know how Selena likely worries what people will say if she and Hailey bump into each other? Well, people will say things even if they don&#8217;t speak. The absence of a &#8220;story&#8221; can become a story itself.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez is singing a pretty angry tune at the moment.</p>



<p>For good reason, too, we should emphasize.</p>



<p>In a since-deleted video posted on her Instagram Stories this week, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/selena-gomez-cries-over-ice-raids-in-emotional-video-all-my-people-are-getting-attacked/">actress responded to the recent deportations</a> that have been occurring in the United States, as carried out by those working under President Donald Trump. </p>



<p>In text laid over the video, Gomez wrote, “I’m sorry,&#8221; adding an emoji of the Mexican flag.</p>

<p>“All my people are getting attacked, the children,” Gomez said in the video. “I don’t understand. I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something but I can’t. I don’t know what to do. I’ll try everything, I promise.”</p>



<p>The Only Murders in the Building star is of Mexican descent and broke down in tears while sharing these words.</p>



<p>Because so many people out there are insensitive morons or very racist or some combination of both, she was criticized almost immediately after uploading this emotional footage.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post, Gomez wrote over a black background, &#8220;Apparently it&#8217;s not ok to show empathy for people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Appearing on Fox News, border czar Tom Homan delivered a blunt response when asked about Gomez’s video.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we’ve arrested any families. We’ve arrested public safety threats and national security threats, bottom-line,” he said.</p>



<p>“President Trump won the election on this one issue &#8212; securing our border and saving lives. What happened on our southern border in the last four years is the biggest national security threat our county has seen, at least in my lifetime.”</p>



<p>One could object to portions of that statement, but at least Homan didn&#8217;t go as far as Sam Parker, a 2018 Republican Senate candidate from Utah, who wrote on Twitter, <em><strong>Deport Selena Gomez</strong></em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez attends the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 10, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California." class="wp-image-517876" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1455636286-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 10, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gomez saw this note and has reacted to it with a shoulder shrug and a guffaw at that idiot&#8217;s expense.</p>



<p>“Oh, Mr. Parker, Mr. Parker. Thanks for the laugh and the threat,&#8221; wrote Selena on social media.</p>



<p>The star&#8217;s original post came one day after 956 people were arrested in a nationwide immigration crackdown &#8230; the most since Trump took office on January 20, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>



<p>There were 956 reported arrests on Sunday, 286 arrests on Saturday and 593 arrests last Friday.</p>

<p>In a candid op-ed for Time Magazine in October 2019, Gomez shared that her aunt “was the first out of her family to cross the border from Mexico into the U.S. in the back of a truck in the 1970s.&#8221; </p>



<p>According to the artist, her &#8220;grandparents followed” and her “father was born in Texas soon after.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Undocumented immigration is an issue I think about every day, and I never forget how blessed I am to have been born in this country thanks to my family and the grace of circumstance,” she wrote at the time, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;When I read the news headlines or see debates about immigration rage on social media, I feel afraid for those in similar situations. I feel afraid for my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selena Gomez has a jaw-dropping net worth: she&#8217;s now a billionaire!</p>



<p>For years, Selena Gomez&#8217;s immense talents have made her famous and successful yet still underappreciated.</p>



<p>In recent years, her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/selena-gomez-emmy-nomination-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first acting Emmy nomination</a> and some other acknowledgments have shown that at least <em>some </em>people are wising up to one of the greatest talents in a century.</p>



<p>Now, Selena&#8217;s net worth has hit a jarring, 10-digit milestone.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez on August 22, 2024." class="wp-image-508751" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_01-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;Only Murders in the Building&#8221; Season 4 premiere on the Paramount Studios lot in Los Angeles, August 22, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-selena-gomez-s-net-worth">What is Selena Gomez&#8217;s net worth?</h2>



<p>According to a report by <em>Bloomberg</em>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/selena-gomez-is-a-billionaire-after-rare-beauty-success-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez has</a> a net worth of $1.3 billion. <em>Billion</em>. With a B.</p>



<p>This makes her one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the United States. Younger even than her longtime friend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-net-worth-billionaire-status-forbes-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fellow billionaire Taylor Swift</a>.</p>



<p>Net worth is an estimation of all of her assets &#8212; not only liquid currency, but the value of her property and more. But how did she make her eye-popping fortune?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez on January 15, 2024 at the Emmy Awards." class="wp-image-508752" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater on January 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Selena Gomez has been acting since she was a small child, appearing on <em>Barney And Friends</em> long before her rise to fame as a Disney star and phenomenal singer.</p>



<p>By her own account, Selena grew up without much money. She has described searching cushions for change with her mom when things were tight.</p>



<p>As a teen, she became famous, and even a household name, particularly when starring on <em>Wizards of Waverly Place</em>. Already, her personal life and alleged feuds and friendships with fellow Disney stars became a hot topic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-selena-gomez-attain-her-net-worth">How did Selena Gomez attain her net worth?</h2>



<p>Obviously, Selena Gomez has made millions for her acting and singing. She currently stars on <em>Only Murders In The Building</em>, which reportedly pays her $6 million per season.</p>



<p>Selena has released numerous albums and plenty of singles. The Selena Gomez &amp; The Scene song &#8220;Naturally&#8221; is one of humanity&#8217;s greatest artistic accomplishments.</p>

Her colossal social media following means that she can charge a hefty fee for paid promotions, which she does very selectively on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/selenagomez/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>However, a major component of Selena Gomez&#8217;s stunning net worth lies <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/hailey-bieber-copy-selena-gomez/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Rare Beauty</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, but it was only 5 years ago that Selena launched her enormously successful makeup line. Though <em>Rare </em>is the title of one of Selena&#8217;s albums, Rare Beauty continues to be a hit with influencers and teens.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg&#8217;s report, the &#8220;vast bulk&#8221; of Selena&#8217;s hard-earned wealth lies in the estimated value of Rare Beauty &#8212; and her stake in it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-683x1024.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez stuns in red on May 19, 2024." class="wp-image-508755" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0906_selenagomez_05-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the &#8220;Emilia Perez&#8221; Photocall at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 19, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There is more, of course, including Selena&#8217;s interest in Wondermind, a mental health platform. Mental health is a topic <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-quits-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near and dear to her heart</a>, even before her bipolar disorder diagnosis.</p>



<p>Selena also owns various properties, has numerous partnerships, and of course has her music and acting career.</p>



<p>And, again, while it does not directly translate to wealth (it almost does), Selena is the third most-followed Instagram account in the world. She is the most-followed woman on the planet and the most-followed account that doesn&#8217;t belong to a soccer player.</p>



<p>Congratulations to Selena Gomez on her staggering net net worth. Given her altruistic inclinations, we&#8217;re excited to see how she wields her wealth.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez has found her forever.</p>



<p>So she hopes, at least.</p>



<p>On December 11, the singer/actress confirmed via Instagram that she has agreed to marry boyfriend Benny Blanco after about a year of dating.</p>



<p>And she could not be happier about it!</p>

<p>&#8220;forever begins now..,&#8221; Gomez captioned her precious post, which features a number of photos of her and her future husband.</p>



<p>For his part, Blanco is ready to make their union official, remarking on Gomez&#8217;s announcement, &#8220;hey wait… that’s my wife.&#8221;</p>



<p>Totally precious, right?</p>



<p>It looks, meanwhile, as of Blanco popped the romantic question during a picnic date&#8230; as Gomez shared a photo of herself admiring her ring while sitting on blankets on a manicured lawn, surrounded by Taco Bell takeout and a wicker basket.</p>

<p>The stars began dating in the summer of 2023 before going public later that year.</p>



<p>They got engaged about two decades after they were first introduced, too, and <em>five</em> years since they collaborated on the song &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Get Enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>How cool is that?!?</p>



<p>“We both met each other like almost 16, 17 years ago,” Blanco recalled in an April interview with SiriusXM Hits 1. </p>



<p>“Obviously, we made a bunch of songs together. But before we had made any music together, I was one of her big meetings—like right around when she was just leaving Disney to make her own music.&#8221;</p>

<p>During a May appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Blanco told the host that he could see marriage in his future with the Only Murders In The Building cast member.</p>



<p>“When I look at her … I’m always just like, I don’t know a world where it could be better than this,” he said at the time.</p>



<p>There have been rumors since August that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomez-engaged-benny-blanco/">Gomez and Blanco would get engaged</a>.</p>



<p>And now, of course, this rumor is an amazing reality.</p>

<p>In December, Gomez professed to a fan online that Benny &#8220;is my absolute everything in my heart&#8221; and also confirmed they&#8217;d been together for six months.</p>



<p>Blanco clearly feels the same way.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s truly my best friend,&#8221; he also told Howard Stern. &#8220;We laugh all f-cking day. She inspires me.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>We&#8217;re so very happy for Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco!</strong></p>

<p>A Selena Gomez <em>Agatha All Along </em>cameo could be spectacular. And it could make a surprising amount of sense.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re halfway through Disney+ premiere season of the long-awaited <em>Agatha All Along</em>, and fans are buzzing with excitement.</p>



<p>The reviews for  <em>WandaVision </em>spinoff are decidedly positive, both from critics and fans alike. </p>



<p>The latter felt particularly justified when one of their conspiracy theories about a new character turned out to be very true! </p>



<p>Now, they&#8217;ve moved on to the next item on the wishlist: Selena Gomez making her MCU debut. </p>



<p>Sounds crazy &#8211; except honestly, it&#8217;s really not. In truth, crazier things have happened &#8211; and Disney has already playing into the idea! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whispers-say-that-selena-gomez-appears-in-agatha-all-along">Whispers say that Selena Gomez appears in &#8216;Agatha All Along&#8217;</h2>



<p>Each new MCU project brings exciting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/king-charles-deadpool-and-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel cameo rumors</a>. Some of them turn out to be true &#8212; like Jennifer Garner reprising her role as Elektra in <em>Deadpool</em>.</p>



<p>Thus far, the whispers of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-mcu-dazzler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift playing Dazzler</a>, a mutant pop star, have yet to materialize. </p>



<p>Where on the spectrum do the Selena Gomez <em>Agatha All Along </em>rumors fall? Well, let&#8217;s look at the context.</p>



<p>Claims of Selena Gomez appearing in some capacity on <em>Agatha All Along</em> have been in circulation since late 2023.</p>



<p>It makes sense. She&#8217;s an enormously talented actress with multiple Disney ties, from her teen acting era to Hulu&#8217;s <em>Only Murders In The Building</em>. (More on that in a bit).</p>



<p>Selena is also an exceptional singer.  Given that the show takes its name from a <em>WandaVision </em>song and also co-stars <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kim-kardashian-slammed-patti-lupone-ahs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadway legend Patti LuPone</a>, Selena sounds like a very good fit. </p>



<p>Adding her voice to the Ballad of the Witches Road would be sensational. But these are just a few reasons why she&#8217;d be a good fit. </p>



<p>Where&#8217;s the proof she&#8217;s joining the cast? Enter Aubrey Plaza to the chat. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-going-down-in-the-comments-aubrey">What&#8217;s Going Down In The Comments, Aubrey?</h2>



<p>Beloved actress Audrey Plaza plays Rio Vidal, one of the witches of<em> Agatha All Along</em>. </p>



<p>Like the rest of the cast, she feels perfect for this witchy role. It <em>also </em>feels<em> </em>like Marvel really leaned into market research on the passionate LGBTQ+ audience for <em>WandaVision </em>and decided to, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/erika-jayne-responds-to-jennifer-lawrence-im-not-evil-im-just-going-through-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erika Jayne</a> might say, &#8220;give the gays everything they want.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Aubrey took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_3Ydt4P_Oj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to share her character poster ahead of the September 18 <em>Agatha All Along</em> premiere, one comment in particular drew people&#8217;s attention.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1001" height="594" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of Selena Gomez having left a fire emoji under Aubrey Plaza's Instagram post for Agatha All Along." class="wp-image-509621" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01.png 1001w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01-300x178.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01-768x456.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01-960x570.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In a reply to Aubrey Plza&#8217;s Instagram post of her Agatha All Along character post, Selena Gomez left a simple affirming comment. What does it mean?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Selena Gomez herself, the Queen of Instagram with nearly half a billion followers, responded to Aubrey Plaza with a &#8220;fire&#8221; emoji.</p>



<p>Now, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/selena-gomez-net-worth-billionaire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaire singers</a> use Instagram to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-ryan-reynolds-sperm-donor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promote Marvel projects</a> from people they admire. Taylor boosted <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> without appearing in it. It&#8217;s always possible that Selena is doing the same for <em>Agatha All Along</em>.</p>



<p>But this is just the first piece of a larger puzzle! </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1024x576.png" alt="A screenshot of WandaVision showing Kathryn Hahn from the Agatha All Along sequence." class="wp-image-509622" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the &#8220;Agatha All Along&#8221; sequence of WandaVision, Kathryn Hahn portrays Agatha Harkness in a montage that reveals her involvement in the entire season&#8217;s events.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Disney+)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-makes-perfect-sense-for-selena-to-join-the-coven">It Makes Perfect Sense For Selena To Join The Coven </h2>



<p><em>WandaVision </em>was chalk full of television references. Wanda Maximoff&#8217;s ability to warp reality had transformed a town into a living sitcom, like if <em>Once Upon A Time</em> had a bigger budget and more consistent writing.</p>



<p>There is a prominent theory that Selena Gomez will reprise her role as Alex Russo from <em>Wizards of Waverly Place</em>. We have no idea of the potential context of this, except that there are many possibilities with ample precedent within the MCU.</p>



<p>Remember, Disney+ is developing a <em>Wizards of Waverly Place</em> sequel series starring David Henrie. It&#8217;s smart to have a soft promo for the project. (And even if it doesn&#8217;t happen, the rumor can only help the show)</p>



<p>As for the vehicle by which we might meet Alex Russo, Selena Gomez&#8217;s character &#8230; there are a lot of possibilities. Remember, Agatha&#8217;s been inside a living television show before. Magical hijinks are almost inevitable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-crosses-over-into-the-mcu-kind-of">Selena Crosses Over Into The MCU &#8211; Kind Of</h2>



<p>We mentioned Only Murder In The Building before, and as of October 2024, there are no bigger shows for the House of Mouse than Selena&#8217;s joint effort with Steve Martin and Martin Short and the debut of Agatha All Along. </p>



<p>With that in mind, and perhaps jumping off the feverish demand to see Selena in the MCU, Disney dropped a huge hint that it wasn&#8217;t such a far-fetched idea with a new promo for both shows!</p>



<p>In the video, Agatha takes over the Arconia, speaking directly to Selena&#8217;s character Mabel over the wireless radio in her apartment. Agatha is even seen in the window of the now famous NYC apartment complex in the opening credits. </p>



<p>Is it just a PR stunt to promote the shows? Of course, but it proves that a cross over is possible &#8211; so maybe this is just the beginning? </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fan-theories-keep-turning-out-to-be-right-on-the-money">Fan Theories Keep Turning Out To Be Right On The Money</h2>



<p>Quick <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">spoiler alert</span></strong> for anyone who is watching to watch when all the episodes are out:</p>



<p>Since the appearance of Joe Locke in the trailers as &#8220;Teen&#8221;, fans guessed that he would turn out to be a crucial character in the MCU. And they were very right!</p>



<p>In the fifth episode, <em>Agatha All Along</em> confirmed Teen is actually Billy Kaplan, aka Wiccan, aka one of Marvel&#8217;s best comics characters. Billy is more than just the son of Scarlet Witch and grandson of Magneto &#8212; he&#8217;s immensely powerful. </p>



<p>Remember Xochitl Gomez&#8217;s America Chavez from <em>Doctor Strange And The Multiverse of Madness</em>? In comics, he was the demiurge who created her home universe before the two became teammates.</p>



<p>Billy Kaplan brings us one step closer to having a solid Young Avengers starting lineup. But we desperately need Teddy Altman (Hulkling, who is both Skrull and Kree). </p>



<p>But aside from all that, it proves that fans are tapped into what Disney is playing at with this series. And so, if the Wiccan theory can turn out to be true, why not the Selena one! </p>

<p>Selena Gomez pregnant? And getting married?! If boyfriend Benny Blanco had his way, these two would be settled down in big ways right now! </p>



<p>But sadly, a new admission from the Disney Channel superstar makes it clear that it will never happen. At least, not the way they might&#8217;ve dreamed. </p>



<p>In recent months, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/selena-gomez-met-gala-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez has been going places with Benny Blanco</a>. And when pushy fans challenge the romance, she&#8217;s not afraid to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-dating-shes-willing-to-fight-fans-over-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down the conversation</a>.</p>



<p>As her ex Justin Bieber prepares to be a dad for the first time, those same pushy fans are wondering if settling down with Benny and having a baby of her own is in the cards. </p>



<p>Despite only dating for a short time, Benny&#8217;s already been talking marriage and kids with Selena! But as for Selena Gomez getting pregnant, that&#8217;s not really in the cards. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benny-blanco-declares-his-love-for-selena-gomez-i-m-ready-for-marriage">Benny Blanco Declares His Love For Selena Gomez: I&#8217;m Ready For Marriage!</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, May 14, the 36-year-old record producer appeared as a guest on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEnD40bmMjQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Howard Stern Show</a></em>.</p>



<p>In the interview, which you can listen to below, Benny opened up about his romance with the <em>Only Murders In The Building</em> star. He detailed their first Valentine&#8217;s Day as a couple, during which he rented out a movie theater while feeding Selena Gomez an assortment of her favorite foods.</p>



<p>“You are some boyfriend, you’re knocking it out the park,&#8221; Howard Stern then praised. &#8220;I see love here, I’m predicting marriage.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">“You and me both,” Benny Blanco then declared.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">“You got a ring?” Stern asked.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">&#8220;I don’t have anything. I got no shoes on,” Blanco joked with a laugh. He then affirmed: “I gotta get my act together.”</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">“When will you propose?&#8221; Stern asked Blanco point blank. &#8220;You should make the announcement now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, this was just Stern doing what he does, egging on guests to make news. Still, he didn&#8217;t let the point go &#8211; perhaps because he could see on Benny&#8217;s face that he wasn&#8217;t insulted by the idea. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">So, Stern then reiterated his question: &#8220;When are you going to propose to your very famous girlfriend Selena?”</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0">That&#8217;s when Blanco added, very seriously: “When I look at her … I’m always just like, I don’t know a world where it could be better than this.”</p>



<p>Now THAT is a romantic!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benny-blanco-s-plans-to-propose-to-selena-gomez">Benny Blanco&#8217;s Plans To Propose to Selena Gomez</h2>



<p>In the summer of 2024, <a data-wpil-monitor-id="127" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomez-engaged-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benny Blanco and Selena Gomez</a> celebrated one year of dating. In fact, Blanco shed light on when the romance began.</p>



<p>At the time, Blanco promised that he had some &#8220;really good stuff&#8221; planned for Selena, especially considering their one-year anniversary is &#8220;right around her birthday.&#8221; As those of us who are diehard Selena stans are well aware, her birthday is July 22.</p>



<p>And she deserves. Selena is sweet, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-body-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strikingly beautiful</a>, and immensely talented. </p>



<p>However, while details of how they spent their anniversary remained private, Selena did post a photo of Benny on the happy day, calling him the &#8220;love of her life.&#8221;</p>



<p>This &#8211; along with the fact that she was spotted out and about with a ring on her finger &#8211; signaled to some that steps were being taken for them to spent forever together. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-pregnant-would-be-benny-s-next-dream-but-there-s-a-catch">Selena Gomez Pregnant Would Be Benny&#8217;s Next Dream &#8211; But There&#8217;s a Catch&#8230;</h2>



<p>Things took an interesting turn during the interview when Benny not only hinted he wanted to get hitched, but also how much he wants kids in that Stern interview!</p>



<p>“I want to have, that&#8217;s like my next goal on the box. I have a lot of God kids, I got a ton of nephews, I love being around kids.”</p>



<p>Now, before anyone gets any ideas, no, Selena Gomez isn&#8217;t pregnant right now.  That&#8217;s Hailey Bieber you&#8217;re thinking of.</p>



<p>The sad truth is, Selena may never be a mother in the traditional sense. As it turns out, in the last few years, Selena has learned that she can never get pregnant. She shared the news with her fans while promoting the latest season of Only Murders In The Building. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-can-t-get-pregnant-i-have-to-grieve">Selena Gomez Can&#8217;t Get Pregnant: I Have To &#8216;Grieve&#8217; </h2>



<p>Selena Gomez revealed she “can’t carry [her] own children” in a vulnerable new interview.</p>



<p>“I unfortunately …&nbsp;have a lot of medical issues&nbsp;that would put my life and the baby’s in jeopardy,” the actress, 32,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/selena-gomez-cover-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained to </a><em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/selena-gomez-cover-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;</em>in a cover story published in September 2024. “That was something I had to grieve for a while.”</p>



<p>Selena, who was&nbsp;diagnosed with lupus&nbsp;in 2013 and&nbsp;got a kidney transplant&nbsp;in 2017, noted that she had not “ever said this” before publicly.</p>



<p>“It’s not necessarily the way I envisioned it,” she continued of becoming a mom one day. “I thought it would happen the way it happens for everyone.”</p>



<p>However, she then clarified, “I’m in a much better place with that. I find it a blessing that there are wonderful people&nbsp;willing to do surrogacy&nbsp;or adoption, which are both huge possibilities for me.</p>



<p>“It made me really thankful for the other outlets for people who are dying to be moms. I’m one of those people. I’m excited for what that journey will look like, but it’ll look a little different.”</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, I don’t care. It’ll be mine. It’ll be my baby,” she said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-desperately-wants-to-be-a-mom">Selena Desperately Wants To Be a Mom</h2>



<p>While Selena kept her pregnancy struggles a secret over the years. , she has been very upfront about how badly she wants to be a mother down. She also has been upfront about how that might be a bit more complicated for her. </p>



<p>Selena has been open about the fact that her bipolar disorder might make it impossible for her to carry children.</p>



<p>However, despite the obstacle, she still plans to start a family one day.“That’s a very big, big, present thing in my life,” Selena told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in November 2022 while discussing how her diagnosis has affected her plans for the future.</p>



<p> “However I’m meant to have them, I will. I think there’s something over me that is maybe my bipolar that kind of just keeps me humble — in a dark way.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-truly-is-my-best-friend">&#8216;She truly is my best friend&#8217;</h2>



<p>But whatever the obstacles might be, it sounds like Benny is ready to fact them with her. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0">“People always said this to me, when you know you meet your best friend, she truly is my best friend,” Blanco described to Stern in his interview.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0">He went on to accurately describe Selena as “the coolest, nicest, sweetest.” Good!</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">“We laugh all &nbsp;f&#8212;ing day, she inspires me,&#8221; Blanco praised. </p>



<p>Blanco also made it clear that Selena&#8217;s career, fame, and talent leave him feeling a little (appropriately) intimidated sometimes.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">&#8220;I get home from work, I think i had a good day. I’m like, What did you do?’ ‘Oh I just fimed this thing with Meryl Streep and then I went to a fundraiser and now I’m recording,'&#8221; he noted.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0">Blanco admitted: &#8220;My day sounds like s&#8211;t every day compared to hers.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then again, you guys are together &#8211; so how s&#8211;t could it really be! </p>

<p>Is Selena Gomez finally engaged?</p>



<p>Fans have given a lot of scrutiny to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/selena-gomez-pregnant-benny-blanco-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&#8217;s relationship</a>. Largely because he is such an <em>unknown </em>compared to her more famous (and infamous) exes.</p>



<p>Well, Selenators may be about to double down on their possibly unwarranted concerns.</p>



<p>Because the pop star and actress herself is dropping hints that&#8217;s she preparing to be a bride &#8211; and she&#8217;s looking for help to plan the perfect wedding! </p>



<p>Plus, she wore as diamond ring at the Emmys, so&#8230;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-amp-the-wedding-planner">Selena Gomez &amp; The Wedding Planner</h2>



<p>Who someone follows on social media is a pretty big deal in the year 2024.</p>



<p>It can signal who is friends, who is enemies, and who is making connections that could impact the next chapter of their life. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s the angle fans are taking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1ewfp7p/selena_gomez_has_started_following_a_wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena started following</a> CMG Weddings &amp; Events on TikTok!</p>



<p>In case the name wasn&#8217;t a dead giveaway, CMG is a wedding planning agency. Now why would someone need to follow a wedding planner if they didn&#8217;t need to plan a wedding?</p>



<p>And why would someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1en36sd/selena_hiding_engagement_ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post a photo</a> the week before following said agency in a white dress all while covering up her ring finger with a pink heart emoji?!</p>



<p>Ah, see the story gets stronger still!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-engaged-did-he-put-a-ring-on-it">Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco Engaged: Did He Put A Ring On It?</h2>



<p>As of Monday, August 22, Selena Gomez has not made any sort of engagement announcement. Neither has Benny Blanco.</p>



<p>However, maybe they don&#8217;t need to! You can find plenty of sweet moments on Selena&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C91GWhDRIkt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, but the aforementioned mirror selfie is not very subtle.</p>



<p>And also quite intentional. Why cover your ring finger purposefully with an emoji if you DON&#8217;T have anything to hide!</p>



<p>And then of course, there is that blind item that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deuxmoi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deux Moi</a>. The gossip site shared a tidbut just before the selfie that strongly suggested that Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are now engaged.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1ek7nx8/according_to_deuxmoi_selena_gomez_and_benny/">According to DeuxMoi, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are officially engaged.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Opportunity_2319/">u/No_Opportunity_2319</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/">popculturechat</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;This A-list actress/semi-retired singer got engaged over the weekend to her bf of a year recently surrounded by friends at their usual beach house hang out,&#8221; the blind item reads.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bling-at-the-emmys">Bling At The Emmys</h2>



<p>Selena is an A-list actress. She was up for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/selena-gomez-emmy-nomination-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Emmy Award</a> for her starring role on <em>Only Murders In The Building</em>, but sadly lost out to Jean Smart from <em>Hacks</em>.</p>



<p>However, her loss was far from what everyone was talking about!</p>



<p>Selena was seen proudly flashing a diamond band on her left ring finger when she stepped out to the 2024 Emmys at Los Angeles&#8217; Peacock Theater Sept. 15. While he didn&#8217;t walk the red carpet, Benny was her date for the evening as well, sitting alongside her in the front row. </p>



<p>Now, the ring was actually a Tiffany platinum band studded with marquis diamonds. So, not your typical engagement ring. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez engagement ring spotted at the 2024 emmys" class="wp-image-509407" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2171586687.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez arrives for the 76th Emmy Awards at the Peacock Theatre at L.A. Live in Los Angeles on September 15, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that Selena also wore four other Tiffany &amp; Co. rings, as well as a diamond cluster bracelet in platinum and a lock bangle in white gold.</p>



<p>So, could the ring have just been a fashion statement? Sure &#8211; OR Selena talked the jeweler to lend her a few other rings as a cover! </p>



<p>Guess we&#8217;ll have to keep waiting for that announcement then. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-really-engaged">Are Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco really engaged?</h2>



<p>Blind items can be glaringly accurate. As we have previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/hailey-bieber-marriage-rumors-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in detail</a>, some blind items warn about very serious matters &#8212; like Louis CK&#8217;s sexual misconduct &#8212; years before they become public knowledge.</p>



<p>However, some blind items are too vague to specify someone in particular. And sometimes, even if the source truly believes it, the news never received confirmation.</p>



<p><em>Deux Moi </em>is somewhat controversial (that may be an understatement), but that doesn&#8217;t have to mean that they&#8217;re wrong.</p>

<p>Either way, if Selena and Benny really <em>are </em>engaged, then they&#8217;re keeping this to themselves. For now.</p>



<p>There could be some very good reasons for that.</p>



<p>Two of Selena&#8217;s previous relationships have seen her besieged by busybodies. Unfortunately, this has even included her own fans.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez on January 15, 2024, attending the Emmy Awards." class="wp-image-506333" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_selenagomez_05-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater on January 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hopefully-fans-will-support-her-regardless">Hopefully, fans will support her regardless</h2>



<p>Selena may be keeping an (alleged) engagement under wraps because fans are weird about her dating life. She&#8217;s seemed to come into <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-dating-shes-willing-to-fight-fans-over-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conflict with fans</a> over Benny Blanco, specifically.</p>



<p>Selenators may be hesitant to endorse this romance because they don&#8217;t really &#8220;know&#8221; Benny Blanco. (Okay, one never really &#8220;knows&#8221; celebrities unless you&#8217;re friends in real life &#8212; but they don&#8217;t <em>feel </em>like they know him)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Selena is sort of sabotaging herself by keeping most of this romance so private. But also? She doesn&#8217;t actually need to worry about fan assumptions. She&#8217;s allowed to live her life.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez has heard the plastic surgery rumors and now she&#8217;s ready to confess. </p>



<p>Most of us know Selena Gomez for her tremendous talent as both a phenomenal singer and an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/selena-gomez-emmy-nomination-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emmy-nominated actor</a>.</p>



<p>But for others, wild speculation about Selena is a hobby. This ranges from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/selena-gomez-date-a-kennedy-jfk-grandson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her love life</a> to rumors of cosmetic procedures.</p>



<p>Selena is tired of it. And, in an effort to shut down rumors, she&#8217;s even opening up about what she <em>has </em>undergone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-people-can-t-seem-to-stop-discussing-selena-gomez-s-appearance">People can&#8217;t seem to stop discussing Selena Gomez&#8217;s appearance</h2>



<p>Over the final weekend of July, a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marissathepa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> denizen named Marissa Barrionuevo discussed Selena Gomez.</p>



<p>Barrionuevo is a physician assistant at a plastic surgery office. There is a &#8220;cottage industry&#8221; on social media of experts dissecting (metaphorically) famous faces and speculating on what work people have had done.</p>



<p>However, she tastefully declined to put <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomez-engaged-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="131">Selena Gomez&#8217;s</a> gorgeous features under a microscope. And she explained exactly why.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez stuns in January of 2024 at the Emmy Awards." class="wp-image-504930" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater on January 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Barrionuevo reminded fans and followers that Selena Gomez has lupus. She noted that battling lupus for a full decade &#8212; as Selena has &#8212; can alter someone&#8217;s appearance. So someone&#8217;s face or body shape may change without cosmetic work being the culprit.</p>



<p>Selena Gomez herself took to the comments under that TikTok video, which Barrionuevo has since deleted, to share her feelings on the topic.</p>



<p>“Honestly I hate this,” Selena expressed. “I was on stripes because of flare up. I have Botox. That’s it. Leave me alone.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="740" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02-1024x740.png" alt="A zoomed in screenshot of Selena Gomez's TikTok screenshot." class="wp-image-504922" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02-1024x740.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02-300x217.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02-768x555.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02-960x693.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02-1080x780.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_02.png 1116w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In a TikTok comment, Selena Gomez opened up about her cosmetic history. She also expressed her frustration with speculation about alleged surgeries.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TIKTok)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-selena-gomez-had-plastic-surgery">Has Selena Gomez had plastic surgery?</h2>



<p>No. As Selena&#8217;s own caption makes clear, she has had simple Botox injections. That has been the extent of her cosmetic work.</p>



<p>Barrionuevo shared Selena&#8217;s comment in a video, offering a public apology for touching upon the subject.</p>



<p>“I adore you,”&nbsp;she&nbsp;affirmed. “I really do mean the best, so I apologize if this rubbed you the wrong way in any way whatsoever.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/" data-video-id="7396413639785205022" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@" href="https://www.tiktok.com/?refer=embed">@</a> <p></p> <a target="_blank" title="♬  -" href="https://www.tiktok.com/?refer=embed">♬  &#8211; </a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Barrionuevo&#8217;s caption reads: “Although I always try to lead with grace and mindfulness, I am sorry this upset you (and I understand why it did).&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I decided to stop making videos like this last year because of the negative impact it can cause. It was never my intention.”</p>



<p>Selena Gomez responded with a very encouraging TikTok comment of her own, writing: “I love you. Not about you. I just get sad sometimes.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="297" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-1024x297.png" alt="A screenshot of a TikTok caption followed by a comment by Selena Gomez." class="wp-image-504923" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-1024x297.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-300x87.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-768x223.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-960x279.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-1080x314.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01-1200x348.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_selenagomez_tiktok_01.png 1295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Responding to a TikTok about her, Selena Gomez affirmed her love for supportive fans.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TIKTok)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-just-get-sad-sometimes">&#8216;I just get sad sometimes&#8217;</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, people being very weird about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-body-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez&#8217;s changing body</a> is nothing new. </p>



<p>People are weird about celebrities. People are weird about women. Obviously, when someone is both, society can be downright <em>vicious</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sorry that Selena felt that she had to disclose anything to kill the plastic surgery rumors. We hope that it works, at least.</p>
