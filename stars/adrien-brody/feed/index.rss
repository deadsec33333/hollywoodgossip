<p>Long before she and Adrien started dating, Georgina was wed to<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/03/harvey-weinstein-sentenced-to-23-years-in-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> now-disgraced producer </a>Harvey Weinstein. They started dating in 2004 and got married in 2007, after he divorced his first wife, Eve Chilton. They share two kids.</p>



<p>After multiple women came forward <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/harvey-weinstein-found-guilty-of-rape-disgraced-mogul-cuffed-and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusing the producer of sexual misconduct,</a> including rape, assault, and harassment, Georgina announced that she was leaving him. They <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-and-georgina-chapman-its-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separated in 2017</a> and settled the following year. Their divorce was finalized in 2019.</p>



<p>Georgina opened up about her marriage to the sex offender in a 2018 interview with <em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/georgina-chapman-life-after-harvey-weinstein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a></em>. She said that throughout their marriage, she had no suspicions about the abuse that he was conducting behind her back.</p>



<p>In the piece, the journalist reported that she and Harvey were in regular touch due to their divorce proceedings. When asked about what he was thinking as the allegations came out against him, Georgina was frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clearly, when I was married to him, I didn’t know anything about his state of mind, so I’m probably not the best person to ask,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-adrien-brody-meet-georgina-chapman">How Did Adrien Brody Meet Georgina Chapman?</h2>



<p>Romance rumors about Adrien and Georgina first surfaced in 2019. It was reported that the pair met in Puerto Rico for a Helena Christensen swimwear launch, according to<a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/02/25/harvey-weinsteins-ex-wife-georgina-chapman-has-moved-on-with-adrien-brody/"> <em>Page Six. </em></a></p>



<p>Coincidentally, the pair also share a birthday. Adrien was born on April 14, 1973, and Georgina was born the same day in 1976.</p>



<p>Since the initial reports, the couple made their red carpet debut at the 2021 Tribeca Film Fest, and Georgina has accompanied the Oscar-winner to a few more film premieres since then.</p>



<p>Georgina has also posted quite a few date night photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAUmJYZugKL/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>, showing off their stylish outfits.</p>

<p>Besides Georgina, Adrien has had one other major public romance. He dated Spanish actress and model Elsa Pataky from 2006 to 2009. </p>



<p>One of the key moments in their relationship was when Adrien bought the <em>Fast and Furious </em>star a house in New York for her birthday. It was designed to look like a castle, and fans still are swooning over the romantic gesture.</p>



<p>In 2010, she married Chris Hemsworth, and they&#8217;ve been together ever since. </p>



<p>While details about the split are not known, the Elsa and Adrien nearly had an awkward run in at the 2024 Met Gala, according to <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13389333/Met-Gala-2024-Elsa-Pataky-cross-paths-ex-Adrien-Brody.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DailyMail</a></em>. Adrien arrived at the event as Elsa and Chris were making their way up the red carpet.</p>
