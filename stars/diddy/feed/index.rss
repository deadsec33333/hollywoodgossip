<p>Will Smith wants to make one thing perfectly clear:</p>



<p>He has zero involvement in the never-ending <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-accuser-says-mogul-raped-her-as-revenge-for-tupac-murder-accusation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations surrounding Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs</a>.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is currently behind bars</a> awaiting trial on a whole slew of charges, many of which stem from rape and sexual assault allegations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-scandal">A Growing Scandal</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/jay-z-accused-of-teaming-with-diddy-to-rape-13-year-old-rapper-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Z became embroiled in the scandal</a>, as an anonymous accuser alleged that the hip hop legend raped her alongside Diddy.</p>



<p>She was just 13 at the time of the alleged incident, which she claims took place in 2000.</p>



<p>Perhaps seeking to preemptively avoid any legal drama of his own, Will disavowed any connection with Diddy during a concert in San Diego Thursday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="728" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-496584746-1-1024x728.jpg" alt="Will Smith attends the Centerpiece Gala Premiere of Columbia Pictures' &quot;Concussion&quot; during AFI FEST 2015 presented by Audi at TCL Chinese Theatre on November 10, 2015 in Hollywood, California.

<p>“The world we’re in right now is really hard for y’all to discern what’s real and what’s true,” Will told the crowd, in footage obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/13/will-smith-says-nothing-to-do-with-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>. </p>



<p>“I haven’t addressed any of this publicly, but I just wanted to say this very clearly: I don’t have s&#8211;t to do with Puffy, so y’all can stop all the memes.”</p>



<p>Will didn&#8217;t go into specifics with regard to the memes, but it seems he&#8217;s upset by some content that he&#8217;s seen circulating on social media.</p>

<p>“You can stop all that bulls&#8211;t I ain’t been nowhere near those damn Freak-Offs. I do enough of my own s&#8211;t, don’t be putting other people’s bulls&#8211;t,&#8221; he continued, referring to Diddy&#8217;s infamous sex parties.</p>



<p>&#8220;I ain’t been anywhere near that man [or] did none of that stupid s&#8211;t, so whenever you guys hear that, it’s a damn lie.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, Will was quite adamant about his lack of any connection to Diddy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1024x683.jpg" alt="Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures' premiere of &quot;Gemini Man&quot; on October 06, 2019 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-515195" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures&#8217; premiere of &#8220;Gemini Man&#8221; on October 06, 2019 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But he also kept things somewhat light, joking that he “doesn’t even like baby oil.” Clearly, Will does not want to wind up answering any Diddy-related questions, as Jay Z might soon find himself doing</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-diddy">What&#8217;s Next For Diddy?</h2>



<p>As for the man at the center of all of this, it&#8217;s looking more and more like he might remain locked for a very long time.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-bail-request-denied-judge-deems-rapper-a-violent-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s bail requests</a> have been repeatedly denied, as accusers continue to come forward with horrifying allegations of abuse.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="752" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-1024x752.jpg" alt='Sean "Diddy" Combs speaks during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference National Town Hall on September 21, 2023 in Washington, DC.' class="wp-image-515180" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-300x220.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-768x564.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-2048x1505.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-960x705.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-1080x794.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1693927301-4-1200x882.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs speaks during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference National Town Hall on September 21, 2023 in Washington, DC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Congressional Black Caucus Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lawyers for the jailed hip hop mogul continue to maintain his innocence.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ll get the chance to make their case in court when Diddy&#8217;s trial gets underway in May.</p>



<p>But however the trial unfolds, we think it&#8217;s safe to say that the court of public opinion has already reached its verdict.</p>

<p>Christian Combs, the son of disgraced hip hop mogul Diddy, is the newest member of his family to be accused of sexual assault.</p>

<p>He faces a slew of charges ranging from human trafficking to racketeering.</p>

<p>Most of the allegations against the famed rapper and producer have to do with the sexual assaults that allegedly occurred at his star-studded parties.</p>

<p>And now, a new accuser is suing Diddy&#8217;s 26-year-old son for assault, battery, sexual assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>

<p>The outlet claims that the documents were delivered to Christian at his father&#8217;s mansion in Miami.</p>



<p>Grace alleges that Christian harassed and assaulted her while she was working aboard a yacht chartered by his family in 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-shocking-allegations-against-the-combs-family">More Shocking Allegations Against the Combs Family</h2>



<p>According to the documents obtained by <em>In Touch</em>, “what was sold as a wholesome family excursion into a hedonistic environment,” when guests who Grace believed were sex workers boarded the yacht.</p>



<p>Grace said the situation &#8220;resulted in an unexpected increase in workload for her and her colleagues as well as unwanted exposure to unlawful drug use, sex work, and general chaos.”</p>



<p>She alleged that at one point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christian Combs</a> “violently grabbed [Grace’s] arm and began hurting her. He pulled [Grace] to the seat beside him and prevented her from getting up.”</p>

<p>She says that Christian forced her to drink with him and would not allow her to return to the ship&#8217;s kitchen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grace-alleges-that-she-was-drugged-and-attacked">Grace Alleges That She Was Drugged and Attacked</h2>



<p>“[Grace] was quite scared and realized she was in a very dangerous situation. [Grace] was also feeling the effect of the tequila shots and quickly suspected that the tequila was spiked,” the court filing reads.</p>



<p>She says that Christian later disrobed in front of her and became “physical and extremely aggressive,&#8221; relenting only when another employee entered the room.</p>



<p>Grace says she complained to the ship&#8217;s captain, but he was unsympathetic and forced her to continue serving Christian. She later quit the job as a result of these incidents.</p>



<p>“In addition to losing her employment, [Grace] also lost her longtime partner, with whom she had planned a future. [Grace’s] partner was never the same after seeing [Grace’s] bruises on her body because of [Christian’s] sexual assault and having to deal with the mental and emotional ramifications, so they separated,&#8221; her lawyer wrote in the suit.</p>

<p>“[Grace’s] mental health deteriorated to the point that she was medicated and required intensive therapy. </p>



<p>Additionally, she fell into a deep depression and was unable to fully carry out her maid of honor duties at the wedding of her only sister in June 2023, which she had been looking forward to doing for over eighteen months,&#8221; the filing continues.</p>

<p>Diddy will not be home for the holidays.</p>



<p>Or any days after that in the near future, either.</p>



<p>On Friday afternoon, a New York federal judge denied the rapper&#8217;s request to be released on bail&#8230; stating on record that &#8220;by clear and convincing evidence&#8221; the mogul is potentially dangerous and &#8220;that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community.&#8221;</p>



<p>This marked the fourth time Diddy has made a bail request &#8212; and the fourth time it was denied.</p>

<p>As reported by a number of outlets on November 27, Judge Arun Subramanian decided in court &#8220;there is compelling evidence of Combs&#8217;s propensity for violence,&#8221; including video obtained by CNN from the 2016 Intercontinental Hotel incident with then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura.</p>



<p>This video, which we&#8217;ve detailed on The Hollywood Gossip, features <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/diddy-violent-video/">Diddy kicking and assaulting Cassie</a>.</p>



<p>Diddy&#8217;s legal team tried to argue that the footage had been edited (despite <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/diddy-breaks-silence-on-graphic-cassie-assault-im-disgusted-with-myself/">Diddy having previously apologized</a> for the horrible act), but the judge simply said there is &#8220;clearly violence even in the version of the footage submitted by Combs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Along with the potential for violence, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-accused-of-witness-tampering-intimation-from-jail/">Diddy was just recently accused</a> of witness tampering from jail.</p>

<p>Prosecutors argued on Friday that Combs&#8217; attempt to influence witnesses while behind bars (via phone calls and threats) &#8220;constitutes obstruction&#8221; of his criminal case. </p>



<p>They also called out the musician&#8217;s&#8217; &#8220;efforts to influence the jury pool&#8221; through a social media campaign organized by his kids.</p>



<p>Back on November 8, Diddy formally asked to be released from Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, claiming that he should be allowed to prepare for his May 2025 trial outside of prison due to changed circumstances and new evidence.</p>



<p>Diddy’s attorneys proposed a “far more robust” $50 million bail package in the filing with stipulations including full-time security monitoring, home detention and restrictions on his ability to contact anyone outside of his legal team.</p>

<p>As you likely know by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/">Diddy was arrested in September</a> on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering.</p>



<p>In a subsequent federal indictment, the public learned about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-indictment-reveals-gruesome-details-of-alleged-freak-off-sex-gatherings/">gruesome details of alleged freak-off parties</a> that included sex workers, drugs, threats of violence and other ways in which Diddy reportedly abused and assaulted a cadre of women.</p>



<p>Via his fourth bail request, the rapper proposed home confinement in his three-bedroom Upper East Side apartment, something the judge simply was not willing to grant, saying in response:</p>



<p>&#8220;Given the nature of the allegations in this case and the information provided by the government, the Court doubts the sufficiency of any conditions that place trust in Combs and individuals in his employ &#8212; like a private security detail &#8212; to follow those conditions.&#8221;</p>



<p>In his decision, Subramanian cited &#8220;evidence supporting a serious risk of witness tampering,&#8221; including Combs&#8217; calls and texts with witnesses, and his flouting of jailhouse rules, like using the phone access codes of other inmates at MDC-Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx has allegedly claimed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-prison-conditions-report-disgraced-mogul-sleeps-among-rats-on-concrete-floor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imprisoned rapper Diddy</a> was responsible for his 2023 hospitalization.</p>



<p>Sources say Foxx made the surprising claim during a recent standup performance.</p>



<p>As you may recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jamie-foxx-remains-hospitalized-friends-plead-for-prayers-amid-health-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxx was hospitalized</a> in April of last year following an unspecified medical emergency.</p>

<p>While he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jamie-foxx-health-update-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken about the situation</a> several times since, the situation remains shrouded in secrecy.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Foxx took to the stage to film his upcoming Netflix standup special, &#8220;What Had Had Happened Was.&#8221;</p>



<p>And at least one witness claims that the comic offered up some shocking new details about his health issues.</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to a comedian and director named Choke No Joke, who was on hand for two tapings, Foxx shocked the crowd with his comments about Diddy.</p>



<p>“Jamie has a special coming out on Netflix called <em>What Had Happened Was</em>, and I went to the taping of it. It was three days taping. I went to the first show; I went to the last show,&#8221; Choke told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5_MMXd4wfA&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comedy Hype</a> YouTube channel.</p>



<p>“Diddy was responsible for what happened to him, and [Foxx] is the one who called the FBI on [Combs].” However, it is unclear whether the alleged comments will be included in the final cut of the special.</p>



<p>Asked if he thought the allegation was a “joke,” Choke replied, “I don’t think he was joking.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>“Y’all can determine was he joking or not when you see the show, ’cause to me — I’m a new comedian, right?&#8221; he explained, in a report compiled by <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/24/celebrity-news/jamie-foxx-addresses-whether-diddy-was-responsible-for-hospitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know when somebody’s setting up a punchline, and I know when you’re serious,” Choke continued, adding that he didn’t want to “give away [Foxx’s] jokes.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-foxx-allegedly-claims-he-called-the-feds-on-diddy">Foxx Allegedly Claims He &#8216;Called the Feds&#8217; on Diddy</h2>



<p>“After [Foxx] said, ‘Diddy did something to me,’ he said, ‘And I’m the one who called the feds on him,&#8217;” Choke continued.</p>



<p>He added that he believes Foxx waited until after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s arrest</a> to reenter public life.</p>

<p>“He disappeared, right? He out now, soon as Puff went to jail, right? We see him at the game with [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones, right? … We haven’t seen him. </p>



<p>&#8220;As soon as Puff went to jail, [Foxx] was at the goddamn Dallas football game, right? And now he just went and shot his special. And who’s the special strongly based around? Diddy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Choke&#8217;s claims were echoed by celebrity bodyguard Big Homie CC, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti_wvUVmtB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who recently told Cam Capone</a>:</p>



<p>“I know [Combs] poisoned Jamie Foxx, and Jamie Foxx reported him to the FBI because of it. Jamie Foxx reported this man to the FBI because of this.”</p>

<p>However, another attendee, Dennis LA White, alleges that Foxx specifically denied that Diddy played only role in his hospitalization.</p>



<p>“People keep asking me if Diddy was responsible. He was not responsible. If he was, I would’ve been dead,&#8221; Foxx remarked, according to White.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Foxx filmed three versions of the special over three nights.</p>



<p>We may have to wait until it premieres on Netflix to see which iteration he wanted to make public.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s first husband, Ojani Noa, says Diddy is to blame for their divorce.</p>



<p>Yes, long before her marriages to Chris Judd, Mark Anthony, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/ben-affleck/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck</a>, J-Lo. was married to Ojani, an up-and-coming chef and restaurateur.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is in jail </a>awaiting trial on sex assault, trafficking, and racketeering charges.</p>



<p>Given the tidal wave of allegations against him, it seems likely that the hip hop mogul will remain behind bars for the rest of his life.</p>



<p>And that would probably be just fine by Ojani, who still blames Diddy for destroying his marriage.</p>

<p>“Part of that divorce was Diddy’s fault,&#8221; Ojani said during a recent interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3TSH7M5rsM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Despierta America.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>Ojani claims that J-Lo became romantically involved Diddy early in their marriage, while she was recording her first album.</p>



<p>“When Sony came and paid her the millions she got, there was Puffy [Diddy], who was going to be one of the producers of several tracks on the first album <em>On The 6</em>,” he explained.</p>



<p>“That’s where the deception, the lies, the separation started. I was in Los Angeles opening my restaurant. And she was between Miami and New York working on the album,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>“When I could, I would go to be with her. There, in that distance, in that separation, was where the deception started.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-contentious-split">A Contentious Split</h2>



<p>Ojani and Jennifer are still not on good terms. In fact, elsewhere in the same interview, he accused her of sabotaging his career. </p>



<p>“I would ask Jennifer, ‘What did I do to you so that you have taken me to court, you have accused me, you have lied, you have created false things about me and you have called several companies to throw me out and different television networks not to give me work?&#8217;” he said.</p>



<p>“Why, if I have not done anything to you? Let her tell the truth, let her tell everything that happened.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-diddy">What&#8217;s Next For Diddy?</h2>



<p>As for Diddy, the rapper&#8217;s trial has been set for May 5. And to say that his legal team is facing an uphill battle would be putting it very mildly.</p>



<p>Several <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-other-celebrities-accused-of-raping-13-year-old-girl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new allegations</a> have surfaced since his arrest, and Diddy&#8217;s requests for bail have been repeatedly denied.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>As more and more lawsuits pile up against Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs, and as grosser and grosser allegations come out against the artist, six of the mogul&#8217;s seven kids have now spoken out.</p>



<p>Via an October 22 Instagram post, Quincy, 33, Justin, 30, Christian, 26, Chance, 18, and twins D’Lila and Jessie, 17, voiced their very strong support for their very polarizing father. </p>



<p>(Combs&#8217; seventh kid, Love Sean, is only 2.)</p>

<p>“The past month has devastated our family,” reads the statement, which was posted on Tuesday alongside a photo of Combs and his children. </p>



<p>&#8220;Many have judged both him and us based on accusations, conspiracy theories, and false narratives that have spiraled into absurdity on social media.”</p>



<p>Addressing their father directly, the loved ones concluded as follows: </p>



<p>&#8220;We stand united, supporting you every step of the way. We hold onto the truth, knowing it will prevail, and nothing will break the strength of our family. WE MISS YOU &amp; LOVE YOU DAD.&#8221;</p>

<p>Combs is behind bars and awaiting a trial in May after getting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/">he was arrested last month</a> on sickening charges of sex trafficking and racketeering.</p>



<p>In the federal indictment, the public learned about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-indictment-reveals-gruesome-details-of-alleged-freak-off-sex-gatherings/">gruesome details of alleged freak-off parties</a> that included sex workers, drugs, threats of violence and other ways in which Diddy reportedly abused and assaulted a cadre of women.</p>



<p>The artist was also known to host a wide range of VERY famous individuals at many of his parties — and two of those stars were included in a recent lawsuit that alleged that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-other-celebrities-accused-of-raping-13-year-old-girl/">joined Diddy in the rape of a 13-year old</a>.</p>



<p>Just awful, awful stuff if true.</p>

<p>The rapper&#8217;s supposed crimes date back to 2008.</p>



<p>According to the unsealed indictment, Diddy and members of his crew are accused of engaging in sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.</p>



<p>&#8220;For decades, the defendant abused, threatened, and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct,&#8221; reads these legal papers. </p>



<p>&#8220;To do so, Combs relied on the employees, resources, and influence of the multi-faceted business empire that he led and controlled — creating a criminal enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>On October 21, meanwhile, a 37-year-old Jane Doe claimed she was drugged and raped by Combs and an unnamed male celebrity at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process,” said a statement from Combs’ attorney in response to this new lawsuit. </p>



<p>“In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman.”</p>

<p>Legal trouble continues to mound for Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs.</p>



<p>On Sunday, lawyer Tony Buzbee filed a lawsuit in federal court that accused Diddy &#8212; <strong>along with two major celebrities</strong> &#8212; of sexually assaulting a 13-year old girl.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511464" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1780944462-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Giggs and Diddy perform at O2 Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire in a special one night only event at O2 Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire on November 7, 2023 in London.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Sean Diddy Combs)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This legal document claims the unnamed victim was &#8220;looking for a place to rest&#8221; and &#8220;entered what she believed to be an empty bedroom so she could lie down for a moment&#8221; at a post-MTV VMAs party on September 7, 2000.</p>



<p>She says she was feeling “woozy and lightheaded” after just one drink at the gathering.</p>



<p>“Soon after, Combs, along with a male and female celebrity, entered the room,” the 19-page action continues. </p>



<p>“Combs aggressively approached Plaintiff with a crazed look in his eyes, grabbed her, and said, ‘You are ready to party!&#8217;”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/">Diddy was arrested last month</a> on sickening charges of sex Trafficking and racketeering.</p>



<p>In the indictment, we learned about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-indictment-reveals-gruesome-details-of-alleged-freak-off-sex-gatherings/">gruesome details of alleged freak-off parties</a> that included sex workers, drugs, threats of violence and other ways in which Diddy reportedly abused and assaulted a cadre of women.</p>



<p>The artist was also known to host a wide range of VERY famous individuals at many of his parties &#8212; and two of those stars have been included in this latest lawsuit.</p>



<p>“Combs then threw Plaintiff toward another male celebrity, Celebrity A, who removed Plaintiff’s clothes as she grew more and more disoriented,” the lawsuit reads. </p>



<p>“Plaintiff was held down by Celebrity A who vaginally raped her while Combs and Celebrity B, a female, watched. After the male celebrity finished, Combs then vaginally raped Plaintiff while the Celebrity A and Celebrity B watched. </p>



<p>&#8220;Combs attempted to force Plaintiff to perform oral sex on him, but she resisted by hitting Combs in the neck; he stopped.”</p>

<p>No celebrities have really addressed the accusations against Diddy in public.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve heard that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/justin-bieber-completely-disgusted-by-diddy-accusations-report/">Justin Bieber is disgusted</a> by them, however, while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/ashton-kutcher-may-move-to-europe-to-escape-diddy-drama-report/">Ashton Kutcher may move out of the country</a> to avoid the scrutiny that comes along with them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth reiterating here: Pretty much every star you can think of has attended some party thrown by Diddy over the years.</p>



<p>“After the assault, Plaintiff fell into a deep depression which continues to affect every facet of her life,” states the suit from Buzbee, who filed similar actions on October 14 for four men and two women. </p>

<p>Last week, Diddy’s represenatives called Buzbee and his initial six lawsuits to be nothing more than a “clear attempt to garner publicity.”</p>



<p>We must admit, though, it&#8217;s rather hard to give Diddy the benefit of any doubt right now.</p>



<p>After being <em>twice</em> denied pre-trial release on $50 million in the month, Combs sits in Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn facing life behind bars if found guilty.</p>



<p>His trial is scheduled to start on May 5, 2025.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-attorney-baby-oil-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations against Diddy</a> have been piling up, and one woman has now accused the disgraced mogul of committing a vile act of revenge in response to comments she made about the murder of Tupac Shakur.</p>



<p>Ashley Parham says that she made the remark during a February 2018 FaceTime call.</p>



<p>And she claims that Diddy later &#8220;gang raped&#8221; her in order to make her &#8220;pay&#8221; for her remarks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-allegedly-planned-gang-rape-in-response-to-tupac-comment">Diddy Allegedly Planned Gang Rape In Response to Tupac Comment</h2>



<p>Parham says the call was set up by a man she was dating. It was allegedly part of his attempt “to impress people with his famous friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>The attempt failed, however, as Parham was not a fan of the rapper&#8217;s. In fact, she seized the opportunity to tell him to his face that she believed Diddy was involved in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/05/afeni-shakur-dies-mother-of-rapper-tupac-was-69/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tupac</a>&#8216;s murder.</p>



<p>One month later, the man invited Parham to his home. He told her that he needed her help administering his medication.</p>

<p>But, according to <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-gang-raped-ashley-parham-as-payback-after-she-claimed-he-was-involved-in-tupac-shakurs-murder-new-lawsuit-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em>, she quickly realized that the invitation had been a set-up for an attack from Diddy and several accomplices.</p>



<p>In the lawsuit Parham filed this week, she says that Diddy and his friends proceeded to sexually assault her.</p>



<p>She adds that at one point, Diddy approached her with a knife and threatened to give her a “Glasgow smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also named in the suit is Kristina Khorram, Diddy&#8217;s alleged “manipulator in chief.”</p>



<p>According to Parham, Khorram talked Diddy out of the &#8220;Glasgow smile. She argued that it would make it more difficult to &#8220;sell&#8221; Parham later.</p>



<p>The horrors that occurred next will be sadly unsurprising to those who are familiar with the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kevin-hart-divorce-wife-eniko-diddy-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">existing allegations against Diddy</a>.</p>

<p>According to Parham, she was raped by three men, including Diddy, who allegedly violated her with a TV remote control.</p>



<p>She says that Khorram then forced her to swallow an &#8220;unknown pill&#8221; before she was expelled from the apartment.</p>

<p>Parham has filed a civil suit in which she seeks $50 million in damages.

<p>She did not, however, name the famous mogul for fear that “she would be ignored … and/or would be further harmed by Defendant Diddy if he discovered she named him to police.” </p>



<p>She says she maintains her belief that Diddy&#8217;s attack was an act of revenge for her comments about Tupac.</p>

<p>More than 120 people have accused the rapper of sexual assault. We will have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Ashton Kutcher was a friend of Diddy&#8217;s for several decades. </p>



<p>Now, like just about everyone else who was ever associated with the disgraced mogul, Ashton is attempting to distance himself.</p>



<p>And in Ashton&#8217;s case, that might involve literal distance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ashton-kutcher-and-diddy-s-long-friendship">Ashton Kutcher and Diddy&#8217;s Long Friendship</h2>



<p>Like many celebrities who first gained fame in the &#8217;90s, Ashton quickly formed a close bond with Diddy.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, these days <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-mom-claims-her-son-is-innocent-in-wake-of-sex-trafficking-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is in jail</a> awaiting trial on a laundry list of charges. Most of them pertain to sexual assault and sex trafficking allegations.</p>



<p>Many celebrities who were once associated with the rapper, like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/justin-bieber-completely-disgusted-by-diddy-accusations-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber</a>, understandably want nothing to do with him these days.</p>



<p>But Ashton and wife Mila Kunis might be taking things a step further. According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-considering-europe-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>, the Kutcher family might soon relocate to Europe.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1486893958-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ashton Kutcher attends the 2023 Milken Institute Global Conference at The Beverly Hilton on May 01, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-major-move">A Major Move</h2>



<p>A source tells the outlet that Ashton, Mila, and their kids spent much of the summer overseas. And now, they&#8217;re eager to return.</p>



<p>“They had such a great time in Europe. And in many ways the idea of moving there is topping their list right now. They figure that would be such a great place to live and raise their kids with a much more grounded lifestyle,” the insider says.</p>



<p> “The only thing stopping them from making the move is work because they do still have a lot of business interests in the U.S. so the concern is that Europe may be too far away.”</p>



<p>But it seems that even if Europe isn&#8217;t in the cards, the Kutchers are eager to raise their kids far from Hollywood.</p>

<p>“Northern California is very appealing to Ashton because he loves to be around all the tech entrepreneurs. And it’s somewhere they could give their kids a more normal life,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p>&#8220;The bottom line is they want to take the kids out of Hollywood and raise them somewhere more rural and away from all the superficiality and backbiting,” the source adds. “They’ve just had it with Hollywood and just going up to Montecito isn’t enough of a clean break. They’d like to get much further away.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ashton-s-frustration">Ashton&#8217;s Frustration</h2>



<p>Sources close to the actor say that Ashton is frustrated that he&#8217;s being asked to comment on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Diddy situation</a>.</p>

<p>The latest developments come on the heels of another sex scandal that indirectly involved Ashton — the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-excoriated-for-defending-convicted-rapist-danny-masterson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conviction of his friend Danny Masterson on rape charges</a>.</p>



<p>“Ashton’s so exasperated that once again he’s being dragged through the mud because of his past associations,” the insider says. </p>



<p>“First it was Danny Masterson and now it’s Diddy. And it’s got him convinced that there are way better places out there to live than Hollywood. In his view, the town is just a cesspool at this point.”</p>

<p>In the weeks since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/diddy-home-raided-by-federal-agents-due-to-horrific-sex-trafficking-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s arrest</a>, several old clips of Ashton discussing their friendship have resurfaced.</p>



<p>“We became fast friends,” Ashton told Sean Evans during a 2019 appearance on <em>Hot Ones</em>. “We used to just hang out and watch football together.”</p>



<p>Asked about Diddy&#8217;s infamous parties, Asthon laughed and remarked, “I’ve got a lot I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Selling out arenas and everything. [You’re] starting to act different, huh? You ain’t been calling me and hanging out the way we used to hang out,” Diddy says to Justin.</p>

<p>It seems increasingly unlikely that Diddy will ever again be a free man.</p>



<p>And Justin has wisely decided to keep his distance from the situation.</p>



<p>“It’s in his past, and that’s where he wants to leave it,” says the insider.</p>
