										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>A couple of years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/amber-rose-expresses-raw-pain-after-breakup-i-cant-fix-my-cheati/">Amber Rose&#8217;s cheating ex left her heartbroken</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just that he had a sidepiece. He had twelve. And, by his own admission, he only stopped there because she caught him.</p>



<p>But Alexander AE Edwards, who is now dating Cher (yes, <em>that </em>Cher), was not her only disappointment. He was merely the latest.</p>



<p>So Amber has made a decision: she&#8217;s done dating men. Enough is enough.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Rose wore shades and a puffy jaguar print jacket while giving an interview. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amber Rose spoke with Sofia Franklyn on a recent episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sofia-with-an-f/id1533822662?i=1000596672603">the <em>Sofia with an F</em> podcast</a>.</p>



<p>Discussing her new attitude on dating, she is veering close to an iconic Whoopi Goldberg quote as she speaks her mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to share my house or my life with anyone,&#8221; Amber emphasized.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8220;I know we&#8217;ve had our differences in the past but my heart is broken for you sis SMH,&#8221; Rose wrote on Instagram. &#8220;No one deserves to feel that pain especially during such a sensitive time. God bless you and your baby,&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>This comes from her frustration, not only as a disappointed partner, but also as a mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anyone around my kids,&#8221; Amber stated.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have sex, no, ew. It&#8217;s so gross,&#8221; she characterized. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8220;I really feel like it&#8217;s going to take, unfortunately, a white actress to come out and say &#8216;Hey, black women need to make as much as we do in movies,&#8217; for there to actually be a change.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>For a long time (and to no one&#8217;s surprise, given her dating history), Amber has felt nauseated by the antics of various men.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse than ever,&#8221; she characterized. &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty disgusting out here. They&#8217;re f&#8211;king gross.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amber then added: &#8220;Like, I want to be single for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-683x1024.jpg" alt="Amber Rose Strikes This Pose" class="wp-image-265299" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-strikes-this-pose-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ATLANTA, GA &#8211; APRIL 20:  Amber Rose attends AHF Presents The Know Your Status Tour -Atlanta at Clark Atlanta University on April 20, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.

<p>Notably, Amber did not single out Alexander AE Edwards, even though the two shared a 3-year relationship.</p>



<p>AE did admit to cheating on her. And what&#8217;s more is that he said that remaining monogamous would be to &#8220;deprive myself of my true nature.&#8221; He commented that &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to live like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s fine, actually. What&#8217;s not fine is entering a monogamous relationship and then cheating. Just be honest. Don&#8217;t betray and devastate the people you claim to love.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alexander Edwards stares into the camera here. </figcaption></figure>



<p>But Amber did mention the end of her erstwhile marriage to Wiz Khalifa. Their marriage lasted from July 2013 to June of 2016.</p>



<p>&#8220;I married my soulmate and then all of a sudden he wasn&#8217;t there anymore,&#8221; she recalled. </p>



<p>&#8220;Because our mothers, the internet, there was too much pressure to be married so young and we just had a baby,&#8221; Amber explained. &#8220;I was f&#8211;king heartbroken.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Rose keeps her head buzzed, but this enables her to accessorize however she likes. She can wear whatever kind of hair or hat she wants.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wiz, too, cheated on Amber. She mentioned his infidelity, which left her devastated at the time.</p>



<p>These days, they are on much better terms.</p>



<p>Amber noted that &#8220;we&#8217;re the best of friends now.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Rose stops here and poses for a selfie, which she later placed on her Instagram page.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, these days, Amber is single. And she&#8217;s actually loving it, she reveals.</p>



<p>Amber commented that &#8220;guys don&#8217;t talk to me anymore.&#8221; But she&#8217;s  not framing that as a bad thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I ever get into a relationship again, which I highly doubt, you&#8217;re not about to play with my life and my mental health,&#8221; Amber warned.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Rose looks very comfortable in this all natural bed selfie. Good for her!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amber then commented: &#8220;I don&#8217;t got time.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to not be in my bed with anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Honestly? Sex is fantastic and deserves its hype. But it isn&#8217;t everything. A good night&#8217;s restful sleep is underrated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last week, <a href="/2021/08/amber-rose-blasts-partner-alexander-ae-edwards-you-cheated-with/">Amber Rose blasted her partner</a>, accusing Alexander &quot;AE&quot; Edwards of prolific cheating with &quot;twelve bums.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time, she hinted that they had broken up and expressed a lot of raw pain at the betrayal.</p>
<p>Now, after Edwards admitted to cheating Amber is still hurting.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s explaining why this cut so deep &#8212; and why she didn&#8217;t end things sooner than she did.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Over the weekend, Amber Rose once again took to her Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>&quot;Ur brain tells you to run when ur heart says stay,&quot; she began her message.</p>
<p>&quot;Gaslighting, stonewealling, deflecting, projecting,&quot; Amber listed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I wish it&nbsp;was easy to &#8216;fix him,&#8217;&quot; Amber wrote.</p>
<p>There is an often misguided impulse to &quot;fix&quot; people, and relationships built on this goal never work out.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Amber acknowledged, &quot;that&#8217;s not for me to do.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Only Edwards can &quot;fix&quot; himself.</p>
<p>&quot;The pain cuts so deep,&quot; Amber expressed.</p>
<p>She pointed out that this is true &quot;especially when children are involved.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I will always love him so much,&quot; Amber wrote with a regretful air.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she added, &quot;I know I can&#8217;t heal him.&quot;</p>
<p>Amber explained that, when it comes to healing, &quot;only he can do that.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I knew I had to set myself free publicly,&quot; Amber wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Or,&quot; she feared, &quot;I would&#8217;ve stayed forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Amber suggested that she would have stayed even while &quot;never receiving the love I craved and begged for.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Tough choice,&quot; Amber admitted.</p>
<p>The decision was a difficult one, she explained, &quot;because it hurts so bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Amber affirmed, &quot;I choose me.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I didn&#8217;t wanna have to do this at all,&quot; Amber wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wanted my family,&quot; she expressed.</p>
<p>In all caps, Amber added: &quot;MY HUSBAND.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s only so many times I can ask a man to be transparent, honest,&quot; Amber lamented.</p>
<p>&quot;And love me wholeheartedly,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>People shouldn&#8217;t have to beg for respect or love. Not from their partners.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll get the happy ending I wanted,&quot; Amber admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;But maybe,&quot; she concluded, &quot;I&#8217;ll get the happy ending I deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>We certainly hope so.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There are worse things that a person can do than cheat, but that is not an excuse or a mitigating factor.</p>
<p>Piling twelve (if not more) side pieces on top of emotional neglect &#8230; that makes it worse.</p>
<p>It is of course a good thing that Amber is able to express her pain. That helps <em>her </em>healing to begin.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Interestingly, after Amber spoke out, some absolute clowns on social media accused her of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that they accused her of being a cheater.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that they somehow misunderstood her activism, including founding the Slut Walk, as some sort of carte blanche endorsement of &#8230; cheating?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The key to Amber&#8217;s activism is sex positivity. She wants to end the bitter stigma around human sexuality.</p>
<p>Like all sex positivity, a key &#8212; if not <em>the </em>key &#8212; concept is consent.</p>
<p>Amber wasn&#8217;t in an open relationship. She didn&#8217;t <em>consent </em>for Edwards to bone anyone else.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Amber promotes individual choice in sexual activity, but in a committed relationship, you are <em>choosing </em>to be faithful to your partner &#8230; or not.</p>
<p>To her credit, Amber did not go further than calling the side pieces &quot;bums&quot; for knowingly hooking up with a cheater.</p>
<p>She acknowledged that they knew and boned him anyway, but also that they didn&#8217;t know her or owe her anything. Very nuanced and wise of her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Amber Rose has never hesitated to <a href="/2020/10/amber-rose-kanye-west-has-been-bullying-me-for-10-years/">call out bad men in her life</a>, even when they&#8217;re part of her past.</p>
<p>Now she is doing it once again, calling out Alexander &quot;AE&quot; Edwards and accusing him of cheating.</p>
<p>She accuses him of cheating with 12 different people, in fact.</p>
<p>Oddly, some people are accusing her of being a total hypocrite for objecting. WTF?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amber Rose took to her Instagram Stories this week to call out her partner and his alleged side pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m tired of getting cheated on and being embarrassed behind the scenes,&quot; she began.</p>
<p>&quot;All 12 of y&#8217;all bums (the ones that I know of there&#8217;s probably more) can have him,&quot; Amber declared.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Y&#8217;all very much knew he was in a relationship with a baby,&quot; Amber accused.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she continued, &quot;y&#8217;all decided to f&#8211;k him anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Explaining how she can be so certain, Amber wrote: &quot;I saw all the texts and DMs.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Y&#8217;all were well aware,&quot; Amber affirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she acknowledged, &quot;y&#8217;all don&#8217;t owe me any loyalty so it&#8217;s whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>That is a nuanced and very mature take, one that will be relevant later.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amber did not name the alleged side pieces.</p>
<p>She affirmed that she is &quot;not in the business of ruining lives.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Amber strongly implied that her relationship is over, and that it ended because of the cheating.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I can&#8217;t be the only one fighting for my family anymore,&quot; Amber expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve been so loyal and transparent,&quot; she noted.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Amber added with regret, &quot;I haven&#8217;t gotten the same energy in return.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;As for him&#8230; The lack of loyalty and the disrespect is ridiculous and I&#8217;m done,&quot; Amber announced.</p>
<p>We of course want to highlight that Amber did not actually name the alleged cheater in this story.</p>
<p>However, her partner of three years obviously came to everyone&#8217;s mind.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Amber also posted a shorter callout targeting her &quot;raging narcissistic mom.&quot;</p>
<p>She wrote that her mother &quot;can get the f&#8211;k out of my life, too.&quot;</p>
<p>And that was not the end.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m tired of being mentally and emotionally abused by people that I love,&quot; Amber lamented.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve been suffering in silence for a long time,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and I can&#8217;t take it anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Amber added: &quot;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been so quiet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve been a shell of who I used to be,&quot; Amber characterized.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she declared, &quot;I refuse to let anyone damage me anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Amber added that this applies whether someone is &quot;Family or not.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Oddly, the mother of two was accused of hypocrisy for her callout post on Twitter.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because she is the founder of the SlutWalk, a sex positive movement to end slut-shaming and erase sexual stigma.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Some very confused people on Twitter suggested that, since Amber supports sexual liberation, she should be fine with what happened.</p>
<p>That does not make one iota of sense &#8230; because she has no problem with sex itself.</p>
<p>Amber isn&#8217;t slut-shaming her (now ex) partner for boning a dozen side pieces. Her issue is the cheating.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sex positivity doesn&#8217;t mean that you can cheat on your partner. Even open relationships require consent for everyone involved.</p>
<p>And notably, Amber offered that very nuance reproach of the side pieces.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not accusing them of being &quot;homewreckers&quot; because, though they knew of her, they were not the cheaters (presumably) &#8212; her ex was.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s tough to describe the extent to which Kanye West&#8217;s popularity has plumetted over the past year.</p>
<p>Although we think the fact that he&#8217;s currently the least well-liked presidential candidate should tell you just about all you need to know.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kanye has always been &quot;brash&quot; or &quot;bold&quot; or whatever BS-y term his defenders have used to describe him, but in recent months, he&#8217;s come off like more and more of a bully, and his behavior is causing even his most ardent fans to back away.</p>
<p>A recent turning point came when <a href="/2020/10/kim-kardashian-just-kidding-im-not-divorcing-kanye/">Kanye accused Kim Kardashian of cheating on him</a> during one of his infamous social media meltdowns.</p>
<p>During this same tirade, West attacked Kris Jenner as a white supremacist and slut-shamed <a href="/2020/02/kylie-jenner-releases-playboy-outtakes-breaks-the-internet/">Kylie Jenner for posing in Playboy</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For casual fans of the rapper, this all might have come as a shock.</p>
<p>But those who have been following Kanye&#8217;s career closely know that he has a long history of making abusive comments toward women.</p>
<p>And now, one of his longest-suffering targets is speaking out.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Long before he married Kim, West dated model Amber Rose for several years.</p>
<p>In an infamous 2015 interview,&nbsp;<a href="/2015/10/amber-rose-opens-up-about-being-slut-shamed-by-kanye-west-wiz-kh/">Kanye slut-shamed Rose</a>&nbsp;and claimed that Kim initially didn&#8217;t want him because of his association with such a promiscuous woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that&rsquo;s with Amber Rose &mdash; I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim [Kardashian],&rdquo; he said at the time.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Rose has mostly endured Kanye&#8217;s abuse quietly, but she spoke out on her own behalf during a recent interview on the No Jumper podcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he says things to make his wife more comfortable, but to slut-shame me and say you needed 30 showers?&rdquo; Amber said.</p>
<p>&quot;You took me around the world. Since when do you need 30 showers?&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Even if someone is picking on me, which he has for 10 years. He has picked on me; he has bullied me for 10 years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose claimed that Kanye referred to her as a &quot;prostitute&quot; at one of his campaign rallies as recently as this past summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy. I have an amazing husband. I have two beautiful kids,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;10 years later, just leave me alone,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amber went on to say that she&#8217;s happy to forgive Kanye&#8217;s past misconduct, provided he stops insulting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously he comes up in interviews because he&rsquo;s a big part of why I&rsquo;m famous,&quot; she said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I try to give interviews and not shy away, but at the same time, it&rsquo;s like &lsquo;bro leave me alone.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>These days, Rose is in a relationship with Alexander &quot;AE&quot; Edwards.</p>
<p>She welcomed her second child in October of last year.</p>
<p>Other than being bullied by one of the most famous men in the world, it sounds like she has a pretty nice life!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>In the weeks since <a href="/2020/01/kobe-bryant-beloved-nba-legend-dies-in-helicopter-crash/">Kobe Bryant was killed</a>&nbsp;in a tragic helicopter crash, family, friends, and fans have honored the Lakers legend in ways both heartwarming and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Never one to be outdone in terms of a grand gesture, it seems the title of Most Bonkers Kobe Tribute belongs to none other than Amber Rose.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As you can see, Rose has decided to adorn her forehead with some elaborate &#8212; and permanent &#8212; script.</p>
<p>The tattooed words read &quot;Bash&quot; and &quot;Slash,&quot; which may sound a bit violent a first, but it turns out those are Rose&#8217;s nicknames for her sons,&nbsp;Sebastian Thomaz and Slash Edwards.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old debuted her latest body art with a pair of Instagram pics.</p>
<p>&quot;When ur Mom lets you draw on ur Barbie #Bash #Slash,&quot; she captioned the first photo.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>For her second pic, Amber got went more in-depth &#8212; and more hilariously profane.</p>
<p>&quot;Beauty is not what&rsquo;s on the outside&#8230;. it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s on the inside that counts. Inside of my P&#8211;sy and inside of my heart,&quot; she wrote alongside the photo above.</p>
<p>&quot;For the people that are telling me I&#8217;m too pretty for a face tat are the same people that would tell me that I&#8217;m &#8216;too pretty&#8217; even if they thought I was ugly and lie to me Lol,&quot; Rose added.</p>
<p>&quot;Or they would just tell me I&#8217;m ugly so either way the moral of the story is do whatever the f&#8211;k you want in life &#8211; muva.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On social media, Rose&#8217;s comments about her tatts have had a rather flippant tone (although we don&#8217;t doubt the sincerity of her message), but in a recent interview with Keyshia Cole, the model offered a much more serious explanation for her new ink:</p>
<p>&quot;I gotta be honest. And I don&#8217;t want this to sounds corny or whatever. After Kobe died&#8230; it made me reflect on my life,&quot; Amber said.</p>
<p>&quot;And I don&#8217;t want people to be like &#8216;Oh Kobe died and you went and got a tattoo.&#8217; But it was kind of like that,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;My dad had cancer when he was like 40. And he went through remission and he&#8217;s good, but he almost died and I&#8217;m 36 and I was like I&#8217;ve been wanting this tattoo for a long time.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s a powerful message, and a heartfelt tribute.</p>
<p>And as a bonus, Amber&#8217;s modeling career shouldn&#8217;t be adversely affected by her new look, as she&#8217;s perfectly on-trend.</p>
<p>Cranial ink is all the rage these days, and just this week, Cindy Crawford&#8217;s son, <a href="/videos/presley-gerber-son-of-cindy-crawford-claps-back-at-trolls-over-f/">Presley Gerber debuted a new facial tattoo</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we doubt that factored into Amber&#8217;s decision-making process.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s more the type to set trends than follow them.</p>

<p>Much to the very pleasant surprise of her social media followers and fans.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The 35-year old model shocked supporters on Wednesday evening by sharing a rather revealing photo of herself at the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>In the image, which we&#8217;ve posted below, Rose&#8217;s top is hiked up, a medical instrument is placed over her belly and there&#8217;s a rather precious picture on the monitor next to her.</p>
<p>Indeed: It&#8217;s an ultrasound appointment.</p>
<p>Because Rose is pregnant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;@ae4president and I are SUPER excited to announce that we have a Sweet little Baby Boy on the way!&rdquo; Amber wrote as a caption to this unexpected snapshot, adding of her first child:</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S Sebastian is soooooo Happy to be a big brother!&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rose and Alexander Edwards have been dating since September of 2018, making their public debut a few weeks later at Rose&rsquo;s fourth annual SlutWalk.</p>
<p>The latter published this same photograph of Rose on <em>his</em> Instagram account and included the following words alongside it:</p>
<p><em>Even when it&rsquo;s dark.. my SON will shine.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank u baby 4 my greatest gift. shit wild! I love you. I can&rsquo;t wait to thug it out w my baby boy. &amp; baby boy, I promise I won&rsquo;t get mad if ur first words r &ldquo;where the bitches @?&rdquo; ( jokinggg-no hyper-masculinity).</em></p>
<p>It sounds very much, based on this caption, that Rose and Edwards have already found out the gender of this impending little one.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rose, meanwhile, is also the mother to a six-year old son she had with Wiz Khalifa.</p>
<p>She famously dated Kanye West several years ago as well.</p>
<p>Amber and Alexander haven&#8217;t flaunted their romance very much, but Rose gushed and gushed and then gushed some more over her boyfriend back in late January.</p>
<p>First, she posted this intense picture of her new baby daddy&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8230; and then she added the following tribute in his honor:</p>
<p><strong><em>He thinks he soooo cute! He really is tho and sweet, smart, talented, charismatic and overall just an amazing man. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In the past I&rsquo;ve used the words &ldquo;best friend&rdquo; very loosely while speaking of my ex&rsquo;s but I can honestly say I feel like this man really is my BEST FRIEND! We talk for hours, he makes me a better person, he listens to me and understands me. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>He also came into my life at a time where I&rsquo;ve had enough of the narcissistic, cheating and abuse I&rsquo;ve endured over the years from my previous relationships&#8230;.. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Me always apologizing for things I had no business apologizing for, being gaslighted, manipulated and mentally abused. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I felt so damaged when I met him and pushed him away in the beginning, he has talked me through everything while simultaneously loving me and working with me so I could overcome my fear of loving someone in the most healthiest way again. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>So @ae4president Thank you for all of ur love and support baby. I love you so much.</em></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Based on how far along Rose appears to be in her ultrasound image, it&#8217;s very possible that Rose had just found out she and Alexander were expecting their child when she posted this caption.</p>
<p>Not that it matters in the big picture.</p>
<p>All that matters here is that the couple is happy and their have a baby on the way.</p>
<p>CONGRATS!</p>
