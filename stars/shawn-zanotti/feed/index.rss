<p><em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> introduced longtime fans to the firebrand&#8217;s family and employees.  This included Wendy Williams&#8217; publicist, Shawn Zanotti.</p>



<p>Viewers of the Lifetime docuseries expressed mixed emotions over Wendy&#8217;s actions, particularly how she initially spoke to her publicist. Then, concerned moved to the publicist and if she had Wendy&#8217;s best interest at heart. </p>



<p>While some argued that Wendy&#8217;s actions could not be helped it due to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-breaks-her-silence-addresses-overwhelming-dementia-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her dementia diagnosis</a>, others were reminded how vulnerable that made Wendy from people who would want to take advantage of her. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-is-unwell">Wendy Williams is unwell</h2>



<p>Her own team very recently revealed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams has primary progressive aphasia</a> and frontotemporal dementia.</p>



<p>Primary progressive aphasia means that there is damage to the parts of her brain that process speech and language. Frontotemporal dementia means a series of worsening symptoms, from language to motor control, and a reduced life expectancy.</p>



<p>This grim news came just days before the premiere of Lifetime&#8217;s <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> docuseries, which began its <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-documentary-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the TV personality&#8217;s troubled life</a> on Saturday, February 24.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, Wendy&#8217;s state of mind is vividly on display during the docuseries. It filmed between August 2022 and April of 2023.</p>



<p>Wendy speaks openly about her fondness for alcohol. The docuseries also delves into her health and history of drug abuse.</p>



<p>Wendy&#8217;s mobility is also an issue, as her lymphedema has radically altered her life. Early on, we see that she is preparing to move to a new apartment &#8212; one that is a single story, so that she can get around more easily.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-wendy-williams-docuseries-is-controversial">The Wendy Williams docuseries is controversial</h2>



<p>A lot of fans are expressing concern. There is a fine line between documentation and exploitation, and it doesn&#8217;t seem that Wendy fully understands the angle that the docuseries is taking.</p>



<p>Of course, many viewers get the feeling that producers had no idea what they&#8217;d be seeing, hearing, and recording before they began this project.</p>



<p>At times, Wendy seems unable to follow conversations &#8212; even though other moments show her lucid and humorous. Some of the interview subjects are more willing to discuss her cognitive decline than others.</p>

<p>One of the most polarizing aspects of <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> has been how Wendy treats others during it.</p>



<p>At one moment, she verbally attacks a nail tech, demanding to know &#8220;Are you stupid?&#8221; She also rants about people who work closely with her.</p>



<p>One of the primary targets of Wendy Williams&#8217; wrath, from what the cameras show, appears to be her publicist: Shawn Zanotti.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-give-publicist-shawn-zanotti-a-hard-time">Wendy Williams give publicist Shawn Zanotti a hard time</h2>



<p>On camera, Wendy calls Shawn a &#8220;dumbass&#8221; over how she returns a jacket to the closet. She is repeatedly impatient with her.</p>



<p>During one horrifying moment, Wendy blurts out her &#8220;wish&#8221; that Shawn would undergo liposuction. That would be awful under any circumstances, but is particularly vile as a way to treat an employee.</p>



<p>Wendy became irate when Shawn couldn&#8217;t locate the right vape, and seemed to lash out when things weren&#8217;t exactly how she wanted them.</p>

<p>This is where viewers are finding themselves with wildly different takeaways.</p>



<p>Some are condemning Wendy&#8217;s behavior, even noting that dementia is not an &#8220;excuse&#8221; for this kind of verbal abuse. Others defend the talk show host, pointing out that she likely has no idea how rude she&#8217;s actually being. </p>



<p>Yet others have expressed suspicions as to why Shawn Zanotti is putting up with this. Who is this publicist that&#8217;s keeping this job instead of finding something less abusive? What&#8217;s her angle?</p>



<p>A few social media denizens have even gone so far as to accuse her of &#8220;stealing&#8221; from Wendy amidst the talk show legend&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diminished net worth</a>. Indeed, even Wendy&#8217;s own family is rather suspicious of the woman when they meet her. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-shawn-zanotti">Who is Shawn Zanotti?</h2>



<p>Shawn is the CEO of her own publicity company. She is the author of a PR guide book. And, at times, she ends up just doing things around the house because Wendy wants her to &#8211; or because she&#8217;s hoping to gain Wendy&#8217;s favor. </p>



<p>According to what she told the cameras, she has &#8220;thick skin&#8221; and can deal with Wendy&#8217;s insults. Ultimately, it looks like Shawn had ulterior motives. </p>



<p>But while Wendy has an excuse, viewers watch as this woman seemingly ignores all of the warning signs and red flags about Wendy&#8217;s condition.</p>



<p>Consider that, against everyone&#8217;s objection &#8211; Wendy&#8217;s family, her manager, even her guardian &#8211; Shawn takes Wendy to Los Angeles for a meeting about starting a new talk show. Plus, she lets her drink before meeting with network execs. </p>



<p>What was there to gain from this manipulation other than money? Wendy&#8217;s niece sees the writing on the wall almost instantly. At one point, she actually refuses to film scenes with Wendy because Shawn, show she &#8220;doesn&#8217;t know&#8221; inserts herself into their visit. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Later, Will, Wendy&#8217;s manager, has it out with Shawn in a private meeting after the Los Angeles trip and after that point, Shawn is never seen again. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-shawn-still-work-for-wendy">Does Shawn still work for Wendy?</h2>



<p>Multiple sources have confirmed to <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/10516677/wendy-williams-manager-will-selby-publicist-shawn-zanotti-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The U.S. Sun</a></em> that Wendy&#8217;s publicist Shawn hasn&#8217;t worked for the ailing star for awhile. We can presume that this change happened after the disastrous LA trip, or at the very least when Wendy checked into a treatment center. </p>



<p>In an interview after the documentary aired, Shawn slammed the project, claiming it &#8220;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wendy-williams-documentary-exploits-star-publicist-dementia-rcna140839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits</a>&#8221; Wendy.</p>



<p>“That is not the project that [Williams] signed up for. That’s not the project [the producers] brought to me. That’s not what I told her this was going to be about,” Shawn said. </p>



<p>“There&nbsp;were a lot of good moments. None of those good moments were shown,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, her jeweler-turned-manager, Will, is said to be in contact with the star but not on a professional basis.</p>
