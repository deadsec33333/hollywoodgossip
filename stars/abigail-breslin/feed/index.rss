<p>With April having been deemed Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the young actress has taken to Instagram in order to let others know they are not alone:</p>
<p>She was once the victim of a sexual assault.</p>

<p>The 20-year old actress, most recently seen on the Fox TV show Scream Queens, shared an image on Tuesday night that reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;You are not obligated to have sex with someone that you&#8217;re in a relationship with. Dating is not consent. Marriage is not consent.&quot;</p>
<p>Breslin&nbsp;then revealed this tragic incident from her past via her caption, which reads:</p>
<p>&quot;I knew my assailant. #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth #breakthesilence.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The former child star also featured the comment as a pinned tweet, and has elicited a number of thoughtful responses from fans as a result.</p>
<p>She has also received support from her fellow celebrities, many of whom have written to her on social media.</p>
<p>Take&nbsp;Sarah Hyland and Debra Messing, for instance.</p>
<p>&quot;Proud of you Abs,&quot; the 26-year old Modern Family star wrote to her friend, while Messing (who will portray Breslin&#8217;s mother in the upcoming Dirty Dancing remake) added:</p>
<p>&quot;I love you, Abbie. Your strength and testimony means so much to too many. #voice.&quot;</p>

<p>Among those who appreciated Breslin&#8217;s honesty was an individual who can sadly relate to what Breslin and many other women have gone through in this area of life.</p>
<p>&quot;My boyfriend in high school sexually abused me for a year. I was 17. I&#8217;m now 24 and I&#8217;m just now realizing what he did to me was abuse,&quot; wrote one commenter on Instagram.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to wait for marriage, but he used his love for me as an argument to get me to have sex with him. He would guilt me into it. This still haunts me to this day.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for sharing this. It&#8217;s so important.&quot;</p>
<p>Wrote another Instagram user in response to Breslin&#8217;s post:</p>
<p>&quot;ik how you feel. An old friend tried to do the same to me and i haven&#8217;t told anyone about it cause i was young at the time.&quot;</p>

<p>The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence estimates that 14 to 25 percent of women will be sexually assaulted by a partner they know.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, Breslin took note of her endless positive replies and followed-up with the following Tweet:</p>
<p>&quot;So beyond thankful by the immense support regarding my IG post last night. I am so lucky to have all of you kind souls in my corner.&quot;</p>
<p>We join everyone else online who has sent their well wishes and their many props to Abigail Breslin.</p>
<p>We thank her for her honesty and her openness and we&#8217;re so very sorry she went through this experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Abigail Breslin has been famous for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s 20 right now, and she starred in her movie, Signs, when she was just five years old &#8212; she&#8217;s been around for a good long while.</p>
<p>And so it just makes sense that in all those fifteen years of fame, she&#8217;d pick up one or two famous friends along the way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that one of those friends is pretty controversial right now, due to the fact that her father is <a href="/2017/01/donald-trump-bashes-meryl-streep-as-overrated-liberal-movie-pers/">the most hated/ignorantly adored man in America</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s Tiffany Trump, y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>Abigail shared this photo yesterday, which was apparently taken at a friend&#8217;s birthday party.</p>
<p>You can see Abigail sitting there with her adorable hair, looking so great, and a couple of other people.</p>
<p>But right in the middle there is Tiffany, Donald Trump&#8217;s fourth child, a painful reminder that the entire country is about to be hurled into <a href="/2017/01/donald-trump-t-shirts-leave-america-stunned-irate/">an ugly apocalyptic nightmare</a>.</p>
<p>And people were <em>very upset</em> at Abigail for this.</p>
<p>&quot;Ew Tiffany Trump seriously wtf&quot; wrote one outraged Instagram&nbsp;user.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Another asked &quot;Whyyy&nbsp;feature the spawn of Satan in your photos!?&quot;</p>
<p>One person suggested that &quot;She probably pretends to support Hillary, she&#8217;s really a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok I&#8217;m not usually one to say anything but why is that scum rat in your life?&quot; someone pondered.</p>
<p>Yet another outraged soul wrote &quot;Tiffany f-cking Trump really? Unfollowed yikes!&quot;</p>
<p>It was a pretty big reaction for a pretty harmless photo &#8212; after all, Tiffany is <a href="/2016/11/donald-trump-disses-tiffany-trump-one-last-time/">Donald&#8217;s least favorite child</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of speculation that Tiffany doesn&#8217;t support her father&#8217;s insane views, and that&#8217;s why she was mostly quiet during his election &#8212; unlike his other adult children.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why one should find some chill over this situation, but don&#8217;t worry. Abigail&#8217;s got the haters covered.</p>
<p>She shared this message shortly after the Tiffany hate started rolling in:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;To everyone who&#8217;s being horrible and disgusting rn,&quot; she began, &quot;I didn&#8217;t vote for Trump. It&#8217;s none of anyone&#8217;s business, but I didn&#8217;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, it is honestly disgusting of people to be so cruel about tiff who is a wonderful and kind person,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#8217;re judging me for hanging out with someone I&#8217;ve known for years at our friends bday party, you need to reevaluate your life.&quot;</p>
<p>And she&#8217;s right, she shouldn&#8217;t be judged for having an old friend with an awful parent.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But we&#8217;re living in a time in which our new president has <a href="/2017/01/donald-trump-on-russia-scandal-what-is-this-nazi-germany/">terrifying ties to Russia</a> and also officially stated that he could never be a participant in a golden shower <a href="/2017/01/donald-trump-i-cant-take-golden-showers-im-a-germaphobe/">because he&#8217;s a germaphobe</a>.</p>
<p>The world is operating under different rules right now. It&#8217;s going to take a bit of time to learn them.</p>
<p>So outraged Instagram users, calm your troubled hearts, Abigail, try to be understanding.</p>
<p>Everyone else, take cover. The apocalypse starts tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been a long wait, you guys!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve waited just over one month for <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/2016/11/watch-scream-queens-online-season-2-episode-5/">Scream Queens Season 2 Episode 5</a>, and it really delivered on the shocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We picked up right where we left off, with Chanel #5 being stabbed in the back and Denise being pretty <em>dead</em>. Dean Munsch knew she needed to get rid of the body if there was any way of saving the hospital, but then it was revealed that every other patient had been murdered.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/season-2/chanel-pour-homme-icide/"></a></figure><figcaption>Watch Scream Queens Season 2 Episode 5 Online</figcaption>
<p>The Chanels and Zayday&nbsp;told Munsch it was time to go to the cops and she reluctantly agreed. However, she asked Zayday to help her with something and the two of them went to dispose of Denise&#8217;s body. Munsch revealed Denise was brain dead and that they could freeze her until they found a cure for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The did the deed, and Munsch agreed that her dream hospital was over. But, in true comedy fashion, we went three weeks later and the hospital was busier than ever. All of the bad press helped the hospital get enough recognition to become a fully functioning one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All it took was a string of murders from the Green Meanie. With the hospital being super busy and Chanel #5 bed bound due to the attack on her, Chanel and #3 were tasked with cleaning all the dirty things in the hospital. Chanel decided she was over it and went forward with a plan to bring in some new Chanels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She reeled in a man who was so obsessed with her that he sent her fan fiction about her life. It was totally tragic and pretty unsafe, but he was a number. She also reeled in two crazy patients from the hospital and Hester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the murderer who tormented their college years got back to being a Chanel. The reason? The mind of a serial killer will help them when the killer inevitably attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay then.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zayday picked up #5 when she found out that Chamberlain was never actually employed by the hospital. The two of them were trying to connect the dots in order to find out if he could have been the baby from the Halloween party all those years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their suspicions hit a new high when they visited the nurse who is the mother, and got to see a picture of the father who looked a little too much like Chamberlain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Zayday confronted him, he confirmed he was never employed, but he liked looking after people and that the hospital was within walking distance to his home. He revealed he was upset with Zayday for trying to imply he was a bad person. This gave Zayday&nbsp;food for thought as she realized Chamberlain may be good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, #3, Brock and Cassidy contracted the Madonna Syndrome. This mysterious syndrome spread to them from a patient who couldn&#8217;t seem to keep the same accent. Brock&#8217;s cure for it was for all of them to watch American TV all weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munsch then confronted Dr. Hoffell about the way she was treating the Chanels and about her drug addiction. Munsch fired her, but Hoffell threatened to lift the lid about her terminal disease.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Don&#8217;t cross me slut, or I&#8217;ll make damn sure it&#8217;s the last thing you do,&quot; Hoffell barked.</p>
<p>The Chanels decided to throw a slumber party at the hospital to bait the new Chanels to the Green Meanie. They sent Chanel #8 to the morgue to get her gift, but #4 went after her because he wanted the choker. #8 left and #4 was murdered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hester then disappeared from the hospital, forcing Munsch to bring in some Chanels of her own. One of them was murdered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, it was revealed that Cascade is the kid from the hospital!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>If you thought the shocking character deaths were going to stop with Chad Radwell meeting his maker, then you were totally wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was Halloween in the hospital and Dean Munsch decided that it would be a good idea to have a party. That came from her wanting to unmask the killer in the wake of Chad being murdered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We picked up with Chanel as a broken woman. The man she loved and was set to marry had just been murdered. In typical Chanel fashion, she went to extremes, overreacting about how her life was over.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/season-2/halloween-blues/"></a></figure><figcaption>Watch Scream Queens Season 2 Episode 4 Online</figcaption>
<p>In actual fact, she never really loved Chad. What she loved was how well-known the Radwell name was and how much it would help her get to where she wanted in her career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chanel has become nothing more than a vile opportunist and it&#8217;s wearing a little thin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t change much for her when it was revealed the Radwell fortune was left to Dean Munsch. Yes, stupid Chad was given the whole fortune because his parents died on their private jet, while rushing to make sure Chad and Chanel did not get married.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the developments led to Chanel running across a table to attack the lawyer. It was a hilariously executed scene that proved Chanel could change things up if she wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munsch&nbsp;and Denise then went to meet up with Hester, to try and get some information on the killer. Hester revealed that they should throw a Halloween party to lure the killer out.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Hester also made a point of pleading with them to let her attend the party, but they laughed it off because of the safety concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Denise changed her tune when she was attacked by the killer, while setting up the hospital for the party. She got Hester an ankle bracelet and out of her cell for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Chanel argued with Dr. Holt about recent events and she said she was unwell, so he gave her silver corundum to try and make her better, but when she woke up she was blue all over.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chanel then went full steam ahead in her quest to make Holt look bad in front of Munsch, but she made it clear that Holt was having sex with her when Chad was murdered.</p>
<p>Chanel then stormed off after learning that someone stole another of her boyfriends. She was attacked by someone dressed as Ivana Trump and was quick to blame Chanel #5 for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5 did have a costume, but it was slightly different. The person in the other costume was revealed to be Hester. At the party, a group of teenagers appeared and they were all ill.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This forced the hospital into action to find a cure, but Chanel and Denise were nowhere to be found. They were busy contacting the spirit of Chad, who revealed that he and Denise had some really good times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scene was cut short when the hospital required them to return, as Zayday tried her best to get to the root of what was going on in the hospital. It turned out that the Green Meanie contaminated the dunking apple water and that&#8217;s why the teens were all ill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5 bumped into Hester, who got set to murder her, but the Green Meanie stabbed #5 in the back. This proved the two killers are working together and Hester knows more than she&#8217;s letting on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Denise appeared and tried to help #5, but she was forced to fight the Green Meanine once more. The murderer got the better of Denise and ended her life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means we&#8217;ve lost two main characters in just two weeks and another is hanging in the balance. What the heck is going on? The show is getting rid of the best characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/">watch Scream Queens online</a>, you&#8217;ll know that Chad and Denise make the show, so they will be sorely missed. Where do we go from here?</p>
