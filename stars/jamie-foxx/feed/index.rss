<p>In May of 2023, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jamie-foxx-remains-hospitalized-friends-plead-for-prayers-amid-health-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Foxx suffered a health scare</a> that had fans fearing the worst: Covid, heart attack, even death!</p>



<p>Jamie was hospitalized under mysterious circumstances, and the infrequent updates on the Oscar winner&#8217;s condition were not encouraging.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jamie-foxx-remains-hospitalized-friends-plead-for-prayers-amid-health-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxx&#8217;s loved ones asked for prayers</a>, but declined to divulge details about his condition. </p>



<p>There were rumors that the beloved actor was unable to walk and would never be able to work again.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Foxx made a remarkable recovery, and it seems that he&#8217;s preparing to open up about everything that he endured.</p>



<p>On his December 10 Netflix special, we finally got the whole story.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jamie-foxx-breaks-silence-on-mysterious-illness-i-was-gone">Jamie Foxx Breaks Silence On Mysterious Illness: I Was &#8216;Gone&#8217;</h2>



<p>During the special, Jamie tearfully revealed that he suffered a &#8220;brain bleed that led to a stroke.&#8221;</p>



<p>The first doctor he visited gave him a cortisone shot and discharged him. (“I don’t know if you can do Yelps for doctors, but that’s half a star,&#8221; Foxx joked.)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184698190-1024x683.jpg" alt="US actor Jamie Foxx speaks during the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 15th Annual Governors Awards at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles on November 17, 2024.

<p>Jamie then went to Piedmont Hospital, where, according to him, the “angel” staff “saved [his] life” and “put [him] back together again.”</p>



<p>“&#8217;He’s having a brain bleed that has led to a stroke. If I don’t go in his head right now, we’re going to lose him,&#8217;” Jamie recalled one doctor saying to his sister.</p>



<p>“&#8217;We didn’t find where it was coming from, but he is having a stroke. He may be able to make a full recovery but it’s going to be the worst year of his life,'&#8221; the same physician said after his surgery. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-backstory">The Backstory</h2>





<p>In late June 2024, Jamie was with a group of people while in Phoenix, AZ, presumably working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ArtOfDialogue_/status/1807761080455995750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recording of their conversation</a>, Jamie can be heard telling the group how on April 11, 2023, he had a “bad headache,” so he asked his “boy for Advil.”</p>



<p>This is the first time Jamie has explained what exactly prompted him to go to the hospital. The problem is, to hear him tell it, there isn’t much he remembers after that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Explaining that he was “in Atlanta” when he was hospitalized, the Oscar winner shared that his sister and his daughter took him to “the first doctor.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>But that’s about all he remembers. In the video, Jamie snaps his fingers and says, “I was gone for 20 days,” admitting that he does not “remember anything.”</p>



<p>He added that when he saw his “next doctor” the physician told him there was something going on up there,” Jamie said, pointing to his head.</p>



<p>At this point, Jamie notices that he’s being filmed, and looking right at the person filming, says, “I won’t say it on camera.”</p>



<p>While the person taking the footage didn’t manage to get the full story, it’s likely we’ll still hear it soon enough.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jamie-foxx-health-update-what-happened">Jamie Foxx Health Update: What Happened?</h2>



<p>On Sunday March 3rd, Foxx made an appearance at the African American Film Critics Association&#8217;s 7th Annual AAFCA Special Achievement Awards.</p>



<p>During his time on stage, Foxx addressed his time in the hospital and revealed that he intended to offer a full account of the situation in his standup special.</p>



<p>“I’m so thankful, and I get emotional because it’s beyond the scope,” Foxx said, after urging the crowd to “cherish life” and their loved ones. </p>



<p>“I had some people in my life that really made sure I was here because it was dire straits,&#8221; the actor continued, according to <em><a href="https://people.com/jamie-foxx-vows-to-address-medical-scare-while-accepting-aafca-award-8603808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>.</p>

<p>“Everybody wants to know what happened and I’m gonna tell you what happened, but I got to do it in my way.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad he waited to speak the truth in his own way.</p>



<p>If anyone can put a humorous spin on a near-tragic situation, it&#8217;s Jamie Foxx. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jamie-s-recovery-was-it-a-heart-attack">Jamie&#8217;s Recovery: Was It A Heart Attack?</h2>



<p>Foxx previously mentioned his long recovery process in December of 2023, during an appearance at the Critics Choice Associations award ceremony.</p>



<p>Foxx explained at the time that the experience has given him a &#8220;new respect for life.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I want to thank everybody. I’ve been through something, I’ve been through some things,&#8221; he said, according to <em><a href="https://www.today.com/health/jamie-foxx-health-rcna128096">Today</a></em>. </p>

<p>“It’s crazy, I couldn’t do that six months ago. I couldn’t actually walk.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thankfully, Foxx was able to return to work just a few months after leaving the hospital.</p>



<p>The running theory at the time was that Jamie had a massive heart attack, that kept him bedridden for weeks on end. But now, given this new insight directly from Jamie, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. </p>



<p>No matter what happened, he stunned fans by showing up on the set of the appropriately titled film <em>Back to Action</em>, in which he costars with Cameron Diaz, once he was healed. </p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jamie-foxx-healthy-wedding-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie showed up at his daughter&#8217;s wedding</a> looking happy and healthy.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad to have Jamie back in action!</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx has allegedly claimed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-prison-conditions-report-disgraced-mogul-sleeps-among-rats-on-concrete-floor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imprisoned rapper Diddy</a> was responsible for his 2023 hospitalization.</p>



<p>Sources say Foxx made the surprising claim during a recent standup performance.</p>



<p>As you may recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jamie-foxx-remains-hospitalized-friends-plead-for-prayers-amid-health-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foxx was hospitalized</a> in April of last year following an unspecified medical emergency.</p>

<p>While he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jamie-foxx-health-update-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken about the situation</a> several times since, the situation remains shrouded in secrecy.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Foxx took to the stage to film his upcoming Netflix standup special, &#8220;What Had Had Happened Was.&#8221;</p>



<p>And at least one witness claims that the comic offered up some shocking new details about his health issues.</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to a comedian and director named Choke No Joke, who was on hand for two tapings, Foxx shocked the crowd with his comments about Diddy.</p>



<p>“Jamie has a special coming out on Netflix called <em>What Had Happened Was</em>, and I went to the taping of it. It was three days taping. I went to the first show; I went to the last show,&#8221; Choke told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5_MMXd4wfA&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comedy Hype</a> YouTube channel.</p>



<p>“Diddy was responsible for what happened to him, and [Foxx] is the one who called the FBI on [Combs].” However, it is unclear whether the alleged comments will be included in the final cut of the special.</p>



<p>Asked if he thought the allegation was a “joke,” Choke replied, “I don’t think he was joking.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>“Y’all can determine was he joking or not when you see the show, ’cause to me — I’m a new comedian, right?&#8221; he explained, in a report compiled by <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/24/celebrity-news/jamie-foxx-addresses-whether-diddy-was-responsible-for-hospitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know when somebody’s setting up a punchline, and I know when you’re serious,” Choke continued, adding that he didn’t want to “give away [Foxx’s] jokes.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-foxx-allegedly-claims-he-called-the-feds-on-diddy">Foxx Allegedly Claims He &#8216;Called the Feds&#8217; on Diddy</h2>



<p>“After [Foxx] said, ‘Diddy did something to me,’ he said, ‘And I’m the one who called the feds on him,&#8217;” Choke continued.</p>



<p>He added that he believes Foxx waited until after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s arrest</a> to reenter public life.</p>

<p>“He disappeared, right? He out now, soon as Puff went to jail, right? We see him at the game with [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones, right? … We haven’t seen him. </p>



<p>&#8220;As soon as Puff went to jail, [Foxx] was at the goddamn Dallas football game, right? And now he just went and shot his special. And who’s the special strongly based around? Diddy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Choke&#8217;s claims were echoed by celebrity bodyguard Big Homie CC, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti_wvUVmtB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who recently told Cam Capone</a>:</p>



<p>“I know [Combs] poisoned Jamie Foxx, and Jamie Foxx reported him to the FBI because of it. Jamie Foxx reported this man to the FBI because of this.”</p>

<p>However, another attendee, Dennis LA White, alleges that Foxx specifically denied that Diddy played only role in his hospitalization.</p>



<p>“People keep asking me if Diddy was responsible. He was not responsible. If he was, I would’ve been dead,&#8221; Foxx remarked, according to White.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Foxx filmed three versions of the special over three nights.</p>



<p>We may have to wait until it premieres on Netflix to see which iteration he wanted to make public.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx looks healthy and happy in a joyful new video.</p>



<p>Back in May of 2023, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jamie-foxx-remains-hospitalized-friends-plead-for-prayers-amid-health-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Foxx&#8217;s health scare</a> was, if anything, <em>understated</em>.</p>



<p>He was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jamie-foxx-health-update-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;gone for 20 days&#8221;</a> fighting for his life in a prolonged coma. Even when he awoke, the beloved actor was unable to walk.</p>



<p>There were real fears that he wouldn&#8217;t be healthy enough to walk his daughter down the aisle. Fortunately, that was not the case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-his-daughter-s-wedding-jamie-foxx-looked-happy-and-healthy">At his daughter&#8217;s wedding, Jamie Foxx looked happy and healthy!</h2>



<p>On Saturday, September 21, 30-year-old Corinne Foxx married college sweetheart Joe Hooten in an outdoor Los Angeles ceremony.</p>



<p>Jamie Foxx was there. He was able to not only attend the nuptials, but to walk his eldest daughter down the aisle.</p>



<p>As even further proof of his recovery, Jamie Foxx danced with his daughter at the wedding reception.</p>

<p>Video of Jamie Foxx looking healthy and proud has surfaced across social media, including here.</p>



<p>From looking at the 56-year-old Oscar winner, you might not know how close he came to death just 17 months ago.</p>



<p>In March of 2023, his near death &#8220;medical complication&#8221; put him into a three-week coma and left him unable to walk. His recovery has been a triumph.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jamie-foxx-s-recovery-has-been-spectacular">Jamie Foxx&#8217;s recovery has been spectacular</h2>



<p>In May, <a href="https://www.accessonline.com/videos/jamie-foxxs-daughter-corrine-foxx-reveals-dads-over-the-top-suggestion-for-her-wedding-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corinne told</a> <em>Access Hollywood</em> that her biggest concern for her father was emotional, not physical.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping he can get down the aisle without crying,&#8221; she quipped at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s going to make it!&#8221; Corinne confessed about her father. &#8220;He&#8217;s really excited, though.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="815" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-1024x815.jpg" alt="Jamie Foxx on March 3, 2024." class="wp-image-509855" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-300x239.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-768x611.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-2048x1631.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-960x764.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-1080x860.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0923_jamiefoxx_03-1200x955.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jamie Foxx accepts the Producers Award onstage during the AAFCA Special Achievement Honorees Luncheon at The Los Angeles Athletic Club on March 03, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kayla Oaddams/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Corinne&#8217;s statements showed a massive contrast with how healthy Jamie Foxx was in May of 2024 versus one year earlier.</p>



<p>In March of 2023, there was fear and confusion. Conflicting reports claimed that Jamie Foxx was already recovering. But, as the world later learned, he spent 20 days in a coma.</p>



<p>Jamie Foxx himself referred to this health scare as going <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/jamie-foxx-releases-first-video-since-hospitalization-i-went-to-hell-and-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;to hell and back.&#8221;</a> Even after the coma, he was unable to walk.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-congratulations-to-the-happy-couple">Congratulations to the happy couple!</h2>



<p>While many of the people celebrating Jamie Foxx looking so happy and healthy at his daughter&#8217;s nuptials, obviously we&#8217;re all happy for Corinne and Joe.</p>



<p>The wedding was their special day. Jamie was just happy to be a part of it.</p>



<p>And everyone, including the bride and groom, were of course delighted that he could be there.</p>

<p> Jamie Foxx is on the road to recovery.</p>



<p>According to Jamie Foxx himself.</p>



<p>On Saturday, the veteran actor posted a video to Instagram, speaking at length to fans for the first time since his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jamie-foxx-remains-hospitalized-friends-plead-for-prayers-amid-health-crisis/">hospitalization in April</a> for an unknown illness.</p>



<p>Foxx addressed some of the rumors out there about him in this footage&#8230; but did not delve into exactly what has been going on with him.</p>

<p>“I know a lot of people were waiting or wanting to hear updates but to be honest with you, I just didn’t want you to see me like that, man,” the former Oscar winner said. </p>



<p>“I want you to see me laughing, having a good time, partying, cracking a joke, doing a movie, television show. </p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t want you to see me with tubes running out of me and trying to figure out if I was gonna make it through.”</p>



<p>Yes, <em>make it through</em>.</p>

<p>There was concern at some points that Foxx would not survive.</p>



<p>“I want to say thank you to everybody that’s prayed, man, and sent me messages. I cannot even begin to tell you how far it took me and how it brought me back,” Foxx continued. </p>



<p>“I went through something I thought I would never ever go through.”</p>



<p>Foxx also credited his daughter and sister for saving his life.</p>

<p>“To them, to God, to a lot of great medical people, I’m able to leave you this video,” he said. </p>



<p>“I cannot tell you how great it feels to have your family kick in in such a way, and y’all know they kept it airtight, they didn’t let nothing out, they protected me, and that’s what I hope that everyone could have in moments like these.”</p>



<p>Foxx&#8217;s daughter revealed her dad had been hospitalized on April 12, although she did not share specifics about the situation. </p>

<p>Foxx has been spotted in Chicago in recent weeks, where he had undergone medical treatment at a facility that specializes in rehabilitation care for patients with physical impairments, brain or spine injuries.</p>



<p>“As you can see, the eyes are working, the eyes are working just fine,&#8221; he said in the video. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not paralyzed, but I went to hell and back, and my road to recovery had some potholes as well. </p>



<p>&#8220;But I’m coming back and I’m able to work.”</p>

<p>The Instagram post arrived a few hours after Foxx shared a photo of himself on top of a gold car with the caption, “big things coming.”</p>



<p>In this case, he concluded as follows:</p>



<p>“I love everybody and I love all of the love that I got … If you see me out from now on and every once in a while I just burst into tears, it’s just because it’s been tough, man. I</p>



<p>&#8221; was sick, man. But now I got my legs under me, so you’re gonna see me out.”</p>

<p>Sources close to the Oscar-winner say that friends and family members are sending a consistent message to anyone who asks:</p>



<p><strong><em>Pray for Jaime.</em></strong></p>



<p>Foxx has been under doctor&#8217;s care Georgia for going on a month now &#8212; with physicians running tests to figure out what exactly transpired.</p>



<p>All we really know at the moment is that Foxx&#8217;s daughter, Corinne, announced her father suffered a &#8220;medical complication&#8221; back on April 12.</p>

<p>The star had been the host of the hugely popular Beat Shazam music lyric game show on FOX, but TMZ now confirms that he will no longer play a role on the series this year.</p>



<p>On April 21, People Magazine published a more optimistic prognosis for Foxx.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s OK, thank God,&#8221; a source tells this outlet about two weeks ago. </p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still in the hospital and doctors are running tests but he&#8217;s awake and alert. They&#8217;re keeping him under observation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Jamie Foxx&#8217;s eldest daughter is 25 years old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We say that only to provide some context to the rumor that Foxx&#8217;s new girlfriend &#8212; singer Sela Vave &#8212; is only 19.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>When <a href="/2019/08/jamie-foxx-defends-singer-sela-vave-following-katie-holmes-split/">Foxx and </a><a href="/2019/08/jamie-foxx-defends-singer-sela-vave-following-katie-holmes-split/">Vave</a><a href="/2019/08/jamie-foxx-defends-singer-sela-vave-following-katie-holmes-split/"> first started dating</a>, her age was reported as 21.</p>
<p>Still a little creepy, considering Jamie is 51, but hey &#8212; at least in this version, Sela can legally order a martini.</p>
<p>But now it looks as though Sela either misled Jamie, or Team Foxx decided to add a couple years to the teen singer&#8217;s age for the sake of appearances.</p>
<p>The truth of the situation was uncovered this week by Radar Online.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The outlet claims that news of the singer&#8217;s youth was confirmed by none other than her mother, who spilled the secret in past Facebook posts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy 17th Birthday to my sweet, kind, thoughtful, talented, beautiful amazing daughter Sela Vave!&rdquo; <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/09/jamie-foxx-new-flame-sela-vave-is-a-teenager/">the elder </a><a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/09/jamie-foxx-new-flame-sela-vave-is-a-teenager/">Vave</a><a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/09/jamie-foxx-new-flame-sela-vave-is-a-teenager/"> wrote</a> in July of 2017.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of pictures this year I thought I&rsquo;d share some of her musical talent&hellip;.. this girl amazes me every day!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the entire Vave family has been boosting Sela&#8217;s singing career since she was a child.</p>
<p>(She&#8217;s basically still a child, but you know what we mean &#8230;)</p>

<p>That might be one reason why her parents are okay with the fact that she&#8217;s hooking up with a dude who&#8217;s quite literally old enough to her grandfather.</p>
<p>Until recently, of course, <a href="/2018/07/katie-holmes-clinging-to-jamie-foxx-relationship-despite-being-p/">Foxx was dating the appropriately-aged Katie Holmes</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, we learned that t<a href="/2019/08/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-split-after-six-years-together/">he couple had split after six years together</a>.</p>
<p>The news was surprising for two reasons &#8212; the relationship appeared to be going well, and no one had any idea they were together for six freakin&#8217; years.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="715" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-715x1024.jpg" alt="Jamie Foxx Attends Showtime Event" class="wp-image-276708" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-715x1024.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-209x300.jpg 209w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-768x1100.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-1072x1536.jpg 1072w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-1430x2048.jpg 1430w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-735x1053.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-234x335.jpg 234w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-242x347.jpg 242w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-363x520.jpg 363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-447x640.jpg 447w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-536x768.jpg 536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-670x960.jpg 670w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-754x1080.jpg 754w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-attends-showtime-event-scaled.jpg 1787w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Less than a week later, news of Foxx and Vave&#8217;s relationship went public.</p>
<p>This was also surprising, as Jamie was intensely secretive about his relationship with Katie, yet seemed to have no qualms about appearing with Sela in public.</p>
<p>Insiders say that when the relationship started, Jamie was not aware that Sela was still in her teens, which is why he had no problem taking her to clubs and other 21-and-older establishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sela called her mom and informed her that Jamie now knows she is 19,&rdquo; an insider tells Radar.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Jamie has told her that she is not allowed to go to bars anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foxx has claimed in the past that he would never date anyone within his daughter&#8217;s &quot;age range.&quot;</p>
<p>The actor took to Instagram Live this week and seemed to suggest that his relationship with Sela is purely professional &#8212; even though she&#8217;s been living with him for over a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I met Ed Sheeran, I didn&rsquo;t know him from Adam,&quot; Foxx said, citing young singers entertainers he&#8217;s mentored in the past.</p>
<p>He slept on my couch for six weeks. Nick Cannon was 13 years old, he used to sleep at my old house.&quot;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that he stopped just short of claiming there&#8217;s no sexual component to his relationship with Sela.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Jamie Foxx recently made headlines for holding hands with 21-year-old Sela Vave just days before it was revealed that <a href="/2019/08/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-split-after-six-years-together/">he had split from longtime GF Katie Holmes</a>.</p>
<p>This Hollywood breakup came as a recent shock to most of us, but the two actually called it quits earlier this summer.</p>
<p>So like Katie and Jamie&#8217;s entire six-year relationship, the public was oblivious. </p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>And unfortunately, it looks like it is going to continue to stay that way. </p>
<p>Foxx, 51, took to his Instagram Live on Wednesday to <a href="https://people.com/movies/jamie-foxx-defends-singer-sela-vave-after-split-katie-holmes/">address the dating speculation between him and Vave</a>, and the backlash she has been receiving since the news of his split has gone public. </p>
<p>He tried to reason that she is simply his new artist and that throughout his career he has made it his mission to take rising stars under his wing.</p>
<p>And apparently, hold hands with them and take them out to the bars too.  </p>

<p>&#8220;When I met Ed Sheeran, I didn&#8217;t know him from Adam. He slept on my couch for six weeks &#8212; he ended up going on to do great things,&#8221; Foxx said in his live video. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nick Cannon was 13 years old, he would sleep in my old house,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>&#8220;Before Ne-Yo was Ne-Yo, he would come to the crib.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody comes to my crib, no matter who you are,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>Hm, no matter who you are, really?</p>
<p>Doubt we would get an invite to join one Jamie Foxx&#8217;s sleepovers, but good to know in case the rent in LA keeps rising. </p>
<p>Foxx then went on to share that this is also the case for Vave.</p>
<p>&#8220;But here was the thing, there is a young lady by the name of Sela Vave. I did the same thing with her,&#8221; he explained. </p>

<p>He revealed that he was introduced to Vave by one of his other artists and got to hear her sing on the front steps of his house &#8212; a moment that Vave also shared to her social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s singing broken down by Beyonce, playing the guitar, and I said &#8216;How the f&#8211;k did this happen?'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, we took her under our wing,&#8221; Foxx said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The actor then explained how all the romance rumors were just a ridiculous double standard. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a double standard when it comes to women &#8212; when it was the guys, everything is cool,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, when it was the women, they try to make it something else, but we are going to try to protect our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And like I said, I spoke to that girl&#8217;s mom and she put her trust in me,&#8221; he added. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The star also addressed the elephant in the room! (The photos of himself and Vave holding hands as they left the Bootsy Bellows nightclub last Friday.) </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m escorting her to my car, to put her in the car &#8212; my artist, who hangs out with my kids and is as young as my daughter,&#8221; Foxx said. </p>
<p>&#8220;People try to make mountains out of molehills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to treat her the same way and give her the same opportunities.&#8221; Adding that he warned Vave of the &#8220;haters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vave shared Foxx&#8217;s video on her own Instagram page, captioning it, &#8220;For the people who care&#8230; here is the TRUE story (swipe)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For everyone else you can keep talking and calling me a whore, slut, home wrecker, thot, gold digger, that I should die, and whatever else you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it doesn&#8217;t matter to me, I&#8217;m out here to work and do what I love most,&#8221; she wrote, adding the hashtags, #music #killthedoublestandard.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The rising star, according to <em>People</em>, is a model and an actress and just moved to LA in July to further pursue her dreams of becoming a musician. </p>
<p>And it sounds like it could happen, considering the help she is getting from <strike>BF</strike> mentor Mr. Foxx. </p>
<p>On Monday, a source told <em>People</em> that &#8220;Jamie and Katie split&#8221; after dating since 2013. </p>

<p>The two never officially confirmed their top secret relationship, so we don&#8217;t expect him to get too real with us now either, TBH. </p>
<p>So, what do you guys think?</p>
<p>Is Jamie romantically involved with Sela?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>These days, <a href="/videos/jamie-foxx-abruptly-ends-espn-interview-due-to-katie-holmes-ques/">Jamie Foxx is all about Katie Holmes</a>. But, according to an accusation, in 2002, he slapped a woman in the face with his penis.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a little more to the allegations, and the woman has come forward and reported the incident to police.</p>
<p>Foxx is dismissing the story as &#8220;absurd&#8221; and has vowed to fight back.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We know that there&#8217;s a temptation to make jokes or to come up with funny nicknames for the incident, like cock-boxing or penis-popping or whatever.</p>
<p>But one way or the other, this allegation is serious, so let&#8217;s take a look at the details.</p>
<p><em>TMZ</em> reports that <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/06/13/jamie-foxx-accused-penis-slap-las-vegas-police-report/">Jamie Foxx&#8217;s accuser</a> says that this incident happened 16 years ago, in 2002.</p>
<p>She says that she and a friend were attending a party at his house.</p>
<p>Foxx allegedly tried to get her to perform oral sex on him. She refused.</p>
<p>She says that he struck her in the face with his penis.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="812" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-812x1024.png" alt="Jamie Foxx on ESPN" class="wp-image-300415" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-812x1024.png 812w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-238x300.png 238w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-768x968.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-735x927.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-266x335.png 266w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-275x347.png 275w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-412x520.png 412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-508x640.png 508w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-609x768.png 609w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-761x960.png 761w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn-857x1080.png 857w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-on-espn.png 985w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ESPN)</figcaption></figure>

<p>After she refused to perform on him, she says that one of Foxx&#8217;s friends instructed her to leave the house.</p>
<p>The incident, she says, was severe enough that she went to the hospital the next day to undergo treatment for a severe panic attack.</p>
<p>She says that the #MeToo movement is what inspired her to come forward with the incident from 16 years ago.</p>
<p>So much about this incident is unclear, including whether or not the alleged penile strike was intentional (since penises can be unwieldy beasts).</p>
<p>But conventional wisdom says that if your penis is accidentally hitting someone who doesn&#8217;t want to touch it, you&#8217;ve probably done something wrong.</p>
<p>But Foxx isn&#8217;t arguing that this alleged sexual misconduct was a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>In a statement to <em>TMZ</em>, Foxx&#8217;s attorney, Allison Hart of Lavely &amp; Singer, says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamie emphatically denies that this incident ever occurred,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very different from saying that it was an accident or misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Hart continues: &#8220;And he will be filing a report with the Las Vegas Police Department against the woman for filing a false police report against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is a very aggressive response.</p>

<p>Hart had more to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first time [Jamie] became aware of this woman&#8217;s absurd claims about an incident that supposedly occurred 16 years ago,&#8221; Hart says. &#8220;Was when TMZ contacted his representatives [Tuesday] about this story.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a hell of a way to find out that you&#8217;re accused of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>And Hart says that there&#8217;s a reason that we&#8217;re all first hearing about htis now.</p>
<p>&#8220;The alleged incident was not reported to law enforcement in 2002, or at any other time in the last 16 years until last Friday because the incident never happened,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She is certainly defending her client very thoroughly.</p>

<p>So, is Hart right?</p>
<p>Is this a much-feared incident of a false allegation of sexual misconduct, inspired by so many very real #MeToo stories?</p>
<p>Or does she have some sort of evidence or outcry witness (or perhaps medical documentation of the panic attack) to back up her report?</p>
<p>Some wonder if Foxx simply has no memory of trying to convince a woman to perform oral sex on him, but that this woman was traumatized by the experience.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for one person to have a very bad night while the person whom they hold responsible for it never noticed.</p>
<p>it is unclear what the accuser expects to come of her report, but it sounds like &#8212; whatever may have happened &#8212; this woman has felt haunted for a long time.</p>
