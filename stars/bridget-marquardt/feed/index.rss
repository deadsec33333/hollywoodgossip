										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>As we all know, <a href="/2017/09/hugh-hefner-and-holly-madison-a-complicated-bitter-history/">Holly Madison and Hugh Hefter had a complicated, bitter history</a> before the <a href="/2017/09/hugh-hefner-dies-legendary-playboy-founder-was-91/">controversial media magnate&#8217;s death</a> in 2017.</p>



<p>Same goes for Bridget Marquardt, who in the last few years, has been very candid about her time in the Playboy mansion and her feelings about being one of Hugh&#8217;s girls. </p>



<p>The friends launched a podcast in 2024 called Girls Next Level to talk about their shared history, as well as current events. </p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s one way of getting closer. Then again, it&#8217;s hard to forget that in 2019, two years after Hugh&#8217;s passing, the pair tried a different way to find closure: a Halloween seance.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="649" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872-1024x649.jpg" alt="Hugh Hefner poses with Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson" class="wp-image-512225" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872-300x190.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872-768x487.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872-960x609.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872-1080x685.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-82998872.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hugh Hefner poses with Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson at the Fox Reality Channel Really Awards on September 24 2008 at the Avalon Hollywood club in Hollywood California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-call-in-the-spirits-wherever-they-re-at">Call in the Spirits, Wherever They&#8217;re At</h2>



<p>Together with Bridget and a medium, Holly participated in a Halloween seance with the intention of contacting the late legend. Holly explained her plans to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1088045/bridget-marquardt-and-holly-madison-hope-to-reconnect-with-hugh-hefner-during-seance"><em>E! News</em></a> on the Wednesday before Halloween that year.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had this dream about him shortly after he died,&#8221; Holly revealed the day before the seance. It was a dream &#8220;where I went to the mansion and he came down the stairs with his arms wide open.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And he gave out his big laugh, it’s like this giant cackle that he had,&#8221; Holly described. &#8220;And he goes, ‘My darling!’ and he gave me a big hug and I could smell his cologne and I could feel the texture of his jacket.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It just felt so real,&#8221; she expressed. &#8220;When I woke up, It felt like that wasn’t just a dream, that was something more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That’s what I would ask him,&#8221; she concluded. &#8220;If that was a dream or if he really came to say goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-seance">Inside The Seance</h2>



<p>And so she did, and at the time, it sounded like the seance went pretty well.</p>



<p>The pair livestreamed the entire thing on YouTube (if you have more than an hour&#8217;s time to watch them and this very nice witch perform the ceremony.)</p>



<p>Bridget says that their mission to contact Hugh&#8217;s spirit as well as various others was a success. Holly asked that the ghosts &#8211; as apparently there were several others &#8211; not damage her home.</p>



<p>Apparently, the women heard from Hugh&#8217;s spirit, and it did sound like the rift was mended between Holly and her departed ex.</p>



<p>Bridget reported that Hugh revealed to Holly that he periodically checks in on her life and her well-being from beyond the grave.</p>



<p>There were no weird special effects &#8212; overturned tables or flickering lights &#8212; because this was not a movie.</p>



<p>And it sounded like Holly was happy to hear from him, despite their complicated history.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyone-hates-hugh">Everyone Hates Hugh</h2>



<p>Holly and Bridget were two of Hugh Hefner&#8217;s girlfriends featured on the reality series, <em>Girls Next Door</em>.</p>



<p>However, Holly accused Hugh of being emotionally and verbally abusive during their relationship.</p>



<p>She has spoken and written about her experiences at the Playboy Mansion, creating tension and a feud with fellow ex Kendra Wilkinson.</p>



<p>In recent years, Holly has been even more candid about her time as one of Hugh&#8217;s girls. And on the podcast with Bridget, she even went into specifics about what happened behind closed doors. </p>



<p>“None of the females were into it, like sorry to burst the bubble,” Holly said in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-11138513/Hugh-Hefners-ex-girlfriend-Holly-Madison-says-Playboy-founder-NOT-sex.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast’s first episode</a> about sex with Hugh. </p>



<p>“We thought of it as a chore that we had to do or else we&#8217;ll get kicked out of the house,” she explained. “And everybody just wanted to make it go by as quickly as possible.”</p>



<p>Even more surprising is the fact that, according to Madison, Hefner would “stay still during sex” and “wouldn’t move” like a “bump on the log in the middle of the bed.”</p>

<p>In a later episode, Bridget reveals how watching the show back has been cringy, right from the very start. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was right off the bat episode two and it just showed me like being jealous of the other girls to the point of trying to sabotage their pictorials and trying to get people drunk &#8212; and that was never, ever like what I was trying to do. These were my friends, I was happy for them and it just &#8212; it really, it was very hard to watch,&#8221; Bridget said. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was hard at the time, but I kind of put it out of my mind and forgot all about it. But when we started rewatching, it was very hard for me to rewatch and I almost didn&#8217;t wanna do the podcast anymore because I thought, &#8216;How am I gonna even explain this?'&#8221; </p>

<p>For years, we have heard <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/holly-madison-and-bridget-marquardt-detail-gross-first-times-with-hugh-hefner/">alarming details about the Playboy Mansion</a>, Hugh Hefner, and more.</p>



<p>Not every former playmate feels the same way, however. And that goes double for <em>Girls Next Door</em> alums.</p>



<p>Kendra Wilkinson has long recalled a distinctly different experience at the infamous mansion.</p>



<p>Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt have a working theory as to why Kendra&#8217;s memories clash with their own.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-1024x675.jpg" alt="Kendra and Holly Picture" class="wp-image-224290" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-1024x675.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-768x506.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-735x484.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-335x221.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-347x229.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-520x343.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-640x422.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-960x633.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture-1080x712.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/kendra-and-holly-picture.jpg 1581w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Kendra Wilkinson and Holly Madison, posing for the cameras. Couple of real winners at life.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Holly and Bridget have been speaking about their experiences on their shared podcast, Girls Next Level.</p>



<p>On a recent episode, the pair delved into how the Playboy Mansion once felt packed with others.</p>



<p>Over time, the population thinned until Holly, Bridget, and Kendra remained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>What made the difference? According to Holly, a key player was absent from the Mansion.</p>



<p>Hugh Hefner no longer had a woman finding young hotties to entertain him in the bedroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t really a recruiter anymore and we weren&#8217;t going to recruit, hell no!&#8221; Holly explained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>According to Holly, Hefner stopped distributing quaaludes in 2004 &#8220;because there weren&#8217;t new girls coming upstaris.&#8221;</p>



<p>Famously, this recollection conflicted with Kendra Wilkinson&#8217;s claims about the Mansion.</p>



<p>&#8220;After my book came out and I talked about the quaaludes, Kendra went on a rant,&#8221; Holly acknowledged.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Kendra Wilkinson is enjoying a cup of coffee in this Instagram photo. She shared it on her page in late 2017.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Holly specified that this was &#8220;on her show when she had that show on WE tv.&#8221;</p>



<p>She described: &#8220;She was like, &#8216;She&#8217;s f&#8211;king lying, Hef&#8217;s a pimp, he doesn&#8217;t have to drug people.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Holly explained: &#8220;I&#8217;m like, he wasn&#8217;t handing them out when you came around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s just so offensive to me,&#8221; Holly expressed.</p>



<p>She felt offense &#8220;when she tries to accuse me of lying when I&#8217;m talking about stuff.&#8221;</p>



<p>Holly then emphasized that these are things &#8220;that happened before she was even there.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Holly pointed out: &#8220;And since then, so many other people have come out talking about the quaaludes.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Kendra joined, the numbers in the Mansion were already dwindling.</p>



<p>She reports that, at the time, Hefner told her that he kicked out one of the girls for offering drugs to Kendra.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Kendra Wilkinson is saying goodbye to her classic blonde look and sporting brunette hair, earning shock and praise from her fans and followers.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the time, Holly believed it. In retrospect, she&#8217;s not so sure that it was true at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;I never heard that from Kendra, she didn&#8217;t mention it in her book …&#8221; she remarked.</p>



<p>Holly added: &#8220;Kendra&#8217;s book is not the most reliable thing in the world, but she didn&#8217;t mention it.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Holly Madison and Hugh Hefner, back in the crazy, creepy day.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Her theory is that Hefner may have told her things to make her &#8220;jealous&#8221; of Kendra.</p>



<p>But with so many &#8220;mean girls&#8221; gone, adding Kendra to the gang &#8220;was like a breath of fresh air.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bridget chimed in: &#8220;We all got along. We did stuff together.&#8221; Holly agreed that it was nice to get a break from the drama.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Bridget admitted that she never read Kendra&#8217;s memoir, and only learned years later how it contrasted with her own experiences.</p>



<p>She emphasized that she is &#8220;not pissed about it,&#8221; noting that Kendra said nice things about the girls.</p>



<p>But Bridget felt astonished over Kendra&#8217;s recollections, which she says were untrue. This details how she felt welcomed (or not) at the Mansion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Holly speculated that Kendra may have felt suspicious of them, and misinterpreted friendliness as some sort of trap.</p>



<p>She also wondered if the memoir&#8217;s ghostwriter used creative license to portray Kendra as &#8220;the underdog.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bridget added that it felt &#8220;disheartening&#8221; to hear Kendra&#8217;s memoir describe drama that she herself went out of her way to avoid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Most of us are still reeling from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/secrets-of-playboy-accuses-company-of-covering-horrific-assaults/">the grisly revelations in the <em>Secrets of Playboy</em> docuseries</a>.</p>



<p>Were they surprising? No. Few people ignored common sense &#8212; or the <em>decades </em>of rumors about Hugh Hefner.</p>



<p>But two <em>Girls Next Door</em> alums have launched a new project.</p>



<p>They are offering unprecedented, NSFW details about their time at the mansion, from first times to being pressured into bareback orgies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt are familiar names and faces.</p>



<p>They appeared on <em>Girls Next Door</em> back when they were Hugh Hefner&#8217;s &#8220;girlfriends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their new project is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4JstWABabZk3fLty7Rhmyt?si=0b1a7f75ab3b4379&amp;nd=1">a podcast, <em>Girls Next Level</em></a>. And the first episode is out now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>The Girls Next Door, Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson and Bridget Marquardt. Bunch of characters right there.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Holly recalled her first time with Hefner. She did not get a chance to get a feel for the place, as she&#8217;d expected.</p>



<p>&#8220;I go to the bed, the other new girl is already laying there, there&#8217;s vibrators laid out for everybody,&#8221; she described.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never used a vibrator in my life,&#8221; Holly admitted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even remember everybody else walking in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just remember laying down and everybody else was there,&#8221; Holly narrated.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;the first thing that happens is The Recruiter says, &#8216;Daddy!'&#8221;</p>



<p>Holly described: &#8220;I&#8217;m gagging as I say this, but everybody used to call him &#8216;Daddy&#8217; in the bedroom, which is so gross.&#8221;</p>

<p>While &#8220;daddy&#8221; is an extremely common nickname for a lover <em>now</em>, in August of 2001, it was <em>unusual </em>to say the least.</p>



<p>&#8220;So she was like, &#8216;Daddy, do you want to get the new girl?'&#8221; Holly described.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I s&#8211;t you not, next thing I know, he&#8217;s on top of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holly explained that she does not remember much of the night.</p>



<p>She and Bridget both agree that the pink pajamas at the house are among the most comfortable that they have ever worn.</p>



<p>But Holly was focused at the time on how she needed to move in, even as weirded out as she felt.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Why? For one thing, not moving in could mean returning to her financial and personal problems at the time.</p>



<p>A lot of predatory employers count on employees being too desperate to turn down an offer.</p>



<p>Additionally, Holly explained that sex was a big deal to her. Plus, she already felt like she was part of this community.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Bridget had a similar story &#8212; this time, about her first time witnessing an orgy at the mansion.</p>



<p>Like Holly, Bridget&#8217;s plan had simply been to hang out and observe, to see how it went and if she was comfortable.</p>



<p>After a Playmate warned her that she might not be invited back if she didn&#8217;t participate, however, Bridget took the plunge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>She felt concerned about STIs at the time, and hoped that everyone had undergone screening as she had.</p>



<p>Bridget admitted that she then tried to get her role in the orgy over and done with as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Her thinking was that getting in and out sooner rather than later would limit her potential exposure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing &#8212; there are plenty of healthy ways to have orgies, plural relationships, and sex work.</p>



<p>Holly and Bridget obviously aren&#8217;t raging against sex or any of these other things.</p>



<p>Instead, the two of them are just sharing their recollections and lived experiences of life at the mansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former <em>Girls Next Door</em> star Bridget Marquardt is not choosing sides.</p>
<p>In fact, she&#8217;d rather talk about her engagement ring, which features a spider made out of diamonds.</p>
<p>Marquardt, 42, spoke to hosts&nbsp;Garcelle Beauvais and Kristen Brockman&nbsp;on <em>Hollywood Today Live</em> yesterday about her October 2015 engagement to director Nick Carpenter.</p>
<p>Oh, and about that massive fight between her former Playboy mansion roommates, <a href="/2016/05/kendra-wilkinson-continues-tmi-takedown-of-holly-madison-she-onl/">Kendra Wilkinson and Holly Madison</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s kind of sad,&quot;&nbsp;Marquardt&nbsp;revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;Like I feel like we have a bond, the three of us. It&#8217;s kind of like, it&#8217;s not like a sisterhood, it&#8217;s not like friends, I mean it is friends, but it&#8217;s something totally different than any other relationship you could possibly imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>That explanation was almost impossible to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;And so in that sense, it kind of makes me sad, but at the same time, I mean, Holly came out with a book and she gave her experience.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what I told Kendra, &lsquo;She&#8217;s writing about her experience and this is how she&#8217;s reflecting on it and she has a right to do that.</p>
<p>&#8216;And you have a right not to agree with her, but lashing out like this and saying such vile things and stuff isn&#8217;t really the way to handle it either,&#8217;&quot; Marquardt&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>On May 17th, Madison debuted her new book, <em>The Vegas Diaries</em>, a follow-up to her 2015 book, <em>Down The Rabbit Hole. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Marquardt&nbsp;also revealed that Wilkinson admitted to never having read either of Madison&#8217;s books.</p>
<p>&quot;She must be referring to the first book that Holly wrote, not the one that&#8217;s coming out right now,&quot; Marquardt said.</p>
<p>&quot;But Kendra hasn&#8217;t read the book. I asked her, she hasn&#8217;t read it.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilkinson reached out to Marquardt to appear on her WE reality show, <em>Kendra On Top</em>. &nbsp;The mom-of-two <a href="/videos/kendra-wilkinson-and-bridget-marquardt-we-made-up-friends-foreve/">apologized to Marquardt</a> for the hurtful things she said about their relationship and how they weren&#8217;t nearly as close as people thought.</p>
<p>&quot;I do feel it was sincere and I do think there&#8217;s a long way to go,&quot; Marquardt&nbsp;said, looking back on their conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s been a long track record of things, you know, so I think that that&#8217;s definitely a step in the right direction, and we both feel really good about it.</p>
<p>&quot;But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re BFFs or anything right now.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So&#8230;these two were at odds, but I&#8217;m not sure anyone was aware.</p>
<p>A preview for an upcoming episode of<em> Kendra On Top</em> features a Come to Jesus between Kendra Wilkinson and her former <em>Girls Next Door </em>co-star/Playboy Mansion roommate, Bridget Marquardt.</p>
<p>Marquardt agreed to a reunion with Wilkinson, who moved out of the Playboy Mansion and married former NFL star Hank Baskett in 2009. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Things between the two women went sour, but Marquardt had no idea why.</p>
<p>&quot;When I saw things like, &#8216;Well, we were never friends,&#8217; and, &#8216;She&#8217;s not appreciative,&#8217; and things like that, I&#8217;m thinking all the things that we did together &ndash; like all the time at the mansion, from all the traveling around the world,&quot;&nbsp;Marquardt explained to Wilkinson.</p>
<p>&quot;We weren&#8217;t always best friends, but we definitely had each other&#8217;s back, and I definitely consider you a friend.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wilkinson admitted to totally f***ing up on their friendship.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I did have &ndash; as we all did, probably, a hard time transitioning into like a world outside the mansion,&quot; she confessed.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was saying those things, it was more about like, trying to distance myself from the mansion as much as I could, which was the wrong thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>During her one-on-one confessional, Wilkinson fessed up to totally dropping the ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Bridget&#8217;s right. She was part of very special moments in my life that really meant a lot to me.&quot;</p>
<p>One person Wilkinson will likely never speak to again? &nbsp;Her <a href="/2016/04/kendra-wilkinson-on-holly-madison-memoir-more-like-up-the-wrong/">other roommate, Holly Madison</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;There was never a moment where I can say she felt real to me,&quot; Wilkinson told Marquardt of Hugh Hefner&#8217;s former &quot;#1&quot; girlfriend, who wrote a scathing tell-all about her time at the Playboy Mansion.</p>

But the former back-up girlfriend to Hugh Hefner has taken out what she refers to as an &#8220;insurance policy,&#8221; just in case: the 37-year old froze her eggs three years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that easy,&#8221; <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/momsbabies/news/bridget-marquardt-why-i-froze-my-eggs-201189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she told</a> <em>Us Weekly</em>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of medication, a lot of hormones. You have to inject yourself in the stomach and I&#8217;m so terrified of needles! It was a difficult thing for me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, why do it? Because Bridget was living with Hefner at the time, but not allowed to date anyone else. With Holly Madison and Hef as &#8220;the main relationship,&#8221; Marquardt just wanted the option later in life.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that clock ticking,&#8221; says the model, who is dating <a href="/stars/nicholas-carpenter/">Nicholas Carpenter</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m not really worried about it. At the same time I would like to have kids someday, but I&#8217;m not one of those people who&#8217;s dying to have kids. If it doesn&#8217;t happen or if I decide to adopt later, that&#8217;s fine, too.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Hugh Hefner has had intercourse with all these woman. Just something to ponder.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Should Hefner have married Madison instead? No, Marquardt says, reasoning:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;She was there for a really long time and she really wanted it. But Holly wanted more than he was able to give. She wants to have kids some day and that&#8217;s something Hef wasn&#8217;t really interested in.&#8221;</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/01/bridget-marquardt-happy-for-hugh-hefner/">Bridget Marquardt: Happy for Hugh Hefner</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>
