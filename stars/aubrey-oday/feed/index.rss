<p>They were a reality TV family whom you could watch to feel better about yourself because you wetr reminded that all of that money can&#8217;t buy depth of character.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="601" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-1024x601.jpg" alt="Trump Family Photo" class="wp-image-234376" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-300x176.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-768x451.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-1536x901.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-2048x1202.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-735x431.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-335x197.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-347x204.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-520x305.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-640x376.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-960x563.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/trump-family-photo-1080x634.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>And like the Kardashians, the Trumps seemed to be in on the joke and capable of lkauching at themselves.</p>
<p>Then they entered the world of politcs, and everything abruptly changed.</p>
<p>These days, the rest of the world is still laughing, except its at, instead of with the Trumps.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="982" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-1024x982.jpg" alt="Trump Family" class="wp-image-248515" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-1024x982.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-300x288.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-768x737.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-1536x1473.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-735x705.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-335x321.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-347x333.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-520x499.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-640x614.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-960x921.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family-1080x1036.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/trump-family.jpg 1635w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Donald and company seemed not to mind so much when they were winging, but now that they&#8217;re about to be shown the loser&#8217;s exit, uou can bet they&#8217;ll be even more combative and cantankerous than ever before.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, Joe Biden won the 2020 election, which means that on January 20 of next year, he&#8217;ll be sworn in as president, and the Trumps will return to the living the lives of private ctizens.</p>
<p>It seems they&#8217;re really dreading that, which is weird, because they never seemed to enjoy being in power all that mcuh.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that the one hit hardest by the loss and the ensuing awkrard transition if none other than DJTJ himself, Don Jr,</p>
<p>Hear us out on this one:</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s the <a href="/2020/11/trump-news-network-is-the-donald-launching-a-media-empire-to-tak/">Trump News Network</a> or some other hare-brained scheme Don Sr., will sadly remain relevant until the day he dies.</p>

<p>Ivanka will go become a Real Housewife of some tax shelter country, and Eric will get to back to working on that Rubik&#8217;s cube he set aside in 2016.</p>
<p>Don Jr., on the other hand, is in a shack in the woods somewhere recording Unabomber-style Instagram Stories about the coming Civil War.</p>
<p>Of course, most of us didn&#8217;t know Don Jr. very well before this, so it&#8217;s possible he was always that way.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To solve that mystery, we turn to a very unexpected source &#8212; former Danity Kane singer Aubrey O&#8217;Day.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/03/aubrey-oday-had-an-affair-with-donald-trump-jr-and-wrote-a-song/">O&#8217;Day had an affair with Don Jr.</a> back when he was still married, and it seems the two of them got to know each other quite well.</p>
<p>Now, fans are point-blank asking O&#8217;Day &#8212; was your ex always like this?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Her answer, surprisingly, is no.</p>
<p>It seems that like the rest of America, Don Jr. was a little effed up to begin with, and the events of the past four years just made him even more hateful and ignorant.</p>
<p>&quot;He wasn&#8217;t that. trust me,&quot; O&#8217;Day replied to one of the many recent queried frim fans.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible that she just never saw that side of him.</p>
<p>After all, no one goes THAT crazy overnight.</p>
<p>Aubrey and Don Jr. began hooking up when she appeared on Celebrity Apprentice back in 2011.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>She has repeatedly defended the affair in interviews.</p>
<p>&quot;On my end, I never broke up a marriage and I never was in an affair,&quot; she recently told Too Fab.</p>
<p>&quot;I was in an open relationship where two people are soulmates and in love and everyone in both of our lives knew about it,&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Of course, she&#8217;s also&nbsp;<a href="/2020/10/aubrey-oday-don-jr-hates-his-dad-ivanka-is-gay-eric-trump-railed/">spilled major tea about the Trumps</a> on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>&quot;don jr HATES his father,&quot; Aubrey recently tweeted.</p>
<p>&quot;ivanka is a lesbian on the low,&quot; she added.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="714" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-714x1024.jpg" alt="DJT" class="wp-image-293504" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-714x1024.jpg 714w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-209x300.jpg 209w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-768x1101.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-1071x1536.jpg 1071w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-1428x2048.jpg 1428w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-735x1054.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-234x335.jpg 234w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-242x347.jpg 242w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-363x520.jpg 363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-446x640.jpg 446w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-536x768.jpg 536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-669x960.jpg 669w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-753x1080.jpg 753w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/djt-scaled.jpg 1785w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;eric f&#8211;ked miss universe on the apprentice board room table while with his now-wife. #Debates2020,&quot; O&#8217;Day concluded.</p>
<p>When Don Jr. eventually responds to all of this, he&#8217;ll probably just claim that Aubrey is trying to land a reality show.</p>
<p>And to that, we say &#8212; give it to her ASAP! She&#8217;s definitely earned it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Well, you can&#8217;t have a presidential election without an October surprise or two.</p>
<p>And since 2020 is the most bonkers year anyone can recall, it stands to reason that this year&#8217;s last-minute twists would be the most ridiculous of all time!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>By now, we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve heard all about Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop and the revelation that he&#8217;s the first person in recorded history to fall asleep in the middle of a crack binge.</p>
<p>Now, the tables are being turned, and we&#8217;re learning some insider gossip about the Trump family courtesy of someone who&#8217;s spent a good deal of time working under &#8212; and top of &#8212; Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p>Last time we checked in on her, Danity Kane singer&nbsp;<a href="/2020/09/aubrey-oday-weight-gain-photos-ignite-intense-social-media-contr/">Aubrey O&#8217;Day was allegedly the victim of some fake news</a> herself, having disputed a British tabloid&#8217;s claim that she&#8217;d transformed into an obese shut-in during the pandemic.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Frankly, we have no idea what sort of shape Aubrey is in these days, but we do know that she&#8217;s returned to doing what she does best &#8212; spilling tea about the Donald and his hilariously dysfunctional brood.</p>
<p>As you may recall,&nbsp;<a href="/2018/03/aubrey-oday-had-an-affair-with-donald-trump-jr-and-wrote-a-song/">Don Jr. had an affair with Aubrey</a> while he was still married to Vanessa Haydon.</p>
<p>At this point, we&#8217;d like to take a moment to remind you that before she met her future husband, <a href="/2018/05/vanessa-trump-cheated-on-her-gang-banger-boyfriend-with-leonardo/">Vanessa cheated on her gang-banger boyfriend with Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="811" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-1024x811.jpg" alt="Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump" class="wp-image-292815" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-1024x811.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-300x238.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-768x608.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-1536x1216.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-2048x1622.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-735x582.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-335x265.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-347x275.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-520x412.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-640x507.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-960x760.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-vanessa-trump-1080x855.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with this story, really, we just like to take every opportunity to reflect on the fact that Don Jr. somehow married a badass.</p>
<p>Anyway, like millions of other Americans, Aubrey is disgusted by the way that Trump and his cronies are attempting to discredit Joe Biden by calling attention to Hunter&#8217;s struggle with substance abuse.</p>
<p>And so, during last week&#8217;s debates, she took to Twitter to share some insider info about the doughiest first family in American history.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Since trump has now lowered this debate to trashing family,&quot; Aubrey began before firing off a list of fun facts about the Trump clan.</p>
<p>&quot;don jr HATES his father,&quot; she tweeted, apparently having decided to kick things off with an obvious one.</p>
<p>&quot;ivanka is a lesbian on the low,&quot; O&#8217;Day continued, ramping up the stakes with admirable speed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-808x1024.jpg" alt="Ivanka" class="wp-image-306052" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-808x1024.jpg 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-237x300.jpg 237w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-768x973.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-1212x1536.jpg 1212w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-1616x2048.jpg 1616w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-735x931.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-264x335.jpg 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-274x347.jpg 274w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-410x520.jpg 410w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-505x640.jpg 505w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-606x768.jpg 606w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-758x960.jpg 758w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-852x1080.jpg 852w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/ivanka-scaled.jpg 2020w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;eric f&#8211;ked miss universe on the apprentice board room table while with his now-wife. #Debates2020,&quot; Aubrey concluded.</p>
<p>That last one&#8217;s not really surprising or consequential, but we respect Aubrey&#8217;s commitment to including all three of the Donald&#8217;s stooges while graciously showing mercy to Tiffany and Barron &#8212; as the former is mostly blameless, and the latter is an innocent victim who will likely bless us with one hell of a tell-all someday.</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself if Don Jr. would really share all of this information with his mistress.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;ll respond to that query with a question of our own and ask you if DJ strikes you as the type to keep <em>anything </em>inside.</p>
<p>Look at his recent TV appearances &#8212; the man can&#8217;t even keep the coke granules from falling out of his nose, and that stuff is expensive!</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Trumps have yet to respond to Aubrey&#8217;s allegations, but they&#8217;ll probably retaliate in their own way very soon.</p>
<p>And by that, we mean a bunch of Twitter users with names like Raskolnikov42069 will start circulating her nudes this weekend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Aubrey O&#8217;Day&#8217;s name might not appear in many tabloid headlines these days.</p>
<p>But the former Danity Kane singer is currently at the center of an intense controversy that&#8217;s sparked debate over a wide array of subjects ranging from body-shaming to celebrities&#8217; right to privacy.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of O&#8217;Day&#8217;s nearly 1 million Instagram users, then you&#8217;re probably accustomed to seeing the 36-year-old as she&#8217;s pictured above.</p>
<p>But according to a<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8682857/Aubrey-O-Day-looks-unrecognizable-promoting-diet-app-filtered-snap-Instagram.html"> new report </a>from the Daily Mail, Aubrey is presenting her fans with a carefully constructed facade so that she can continue signing lucrative sponsored content deals with companies that manufacture diet supplements.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/aubrey-oday-weight-gain-video-watch-the-controversial-footage"></a></figure></div>
<p>The Mail has published photos along with a headline reading,&nbsp;&quot;Aubrey O&#8217;Day Looks Unrecognizable as She Emerges for a Stroll With Her Dogs After Promoting Diet App With Filtered Snap on Instagram.&quot;</p>
<p>You can see the photos published by the newspaper in the video above.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The report quickly gained traction on social media, prompting O&#8217;Day to lash out at what she claims are fraudulent photos.</p>
<p>And she did so with photographic evidence that the Mail is deceiving its readers.</p>
<p>Aubrey posted the photo above in which she&#8217;s seen holding a sign with the date that it was taken.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The sign also features the words, &quot;This is degrading.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s so sick what ppl will do for click bait!&quot; O&#8217;Day captioned the photo on Instagram.</p>
<p>&quot;And that my lawyer needed this photo to defend me against it.. When is this industry going to stop abusing women&#8217;s bodies!&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry my place is a mess, currently remodeling my glam room &#8211; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be written that I&#8217;m a hoarder next!&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Mail has yet to respond to O&#8217;Day&#8217;s allegations, and it will be interesting to see how/if the publication does.</p>
<p>Instances of body-shaming from the celebrity tabloid media are sadly common, but this case is unusual.</p>
<p>Aubrey is claiming that the photo is either not her, or not an accurate representation of her appearance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>She seems to be alleging that the woman in the pics is not her &#8230; or that the Mail manipulated the images in order to make her appear that she had gained weight.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not entirely clear which.</p>
<p>Either way, the Mail will have quite the lawsuit on its hands if she&#8217;s able to prove her case.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>O&#8217;Day is best known for her work with Danity Kane, the girl group that was founded as part of MTV&#8217;s Making the Band series.</p>
<p>In recent years, she&#8217;s remained in the public eye due to her popularity as an Instagram model, and her much-publicized <a href="/2019/07/aubrey-oday-to-donald-trump-jr-dump-kimberly-guilfoyle-and-get-b/">relationship with Donald Trump Jr.</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll bring you further updates on this ongoing story as more information becomes available.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/09/01/aubrey-oday-paparazzi-photos-not-altered-source-says/">A source close to the situation</a> has confirmed to the New York Post that the photos of O&#8217;Day published in the Daily Mail are authentic and unaltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were only cropped,&rdquo; the insider said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even color-corrected at all.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The source adds that the two dogs in the photo are O&#8217;Day&#8217;s pets.</p>
<p>The informant says the photo was taken as Aubrey was leaving Cheeky&#8217;s restaurant in Palm Springs, which is known to be one of her favorite establishments.</p>
<p>She also points out that the tattoos on the woman in the photo match up with O&#8217;Day&#8217;s.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Seemingly by way of explaining O&#8217;Day&#8217;s appearance, the source added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t done well throughout the pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the response photo posted by Aubrey on Instagram, photo experts for the Post claim it shows signs of having been altered.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Aubrey&#8217;s legal team responded to today&#8217;s revelations with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Aubrey&rsquo;s post speaks for itself.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The person in the paparazzi photos is not the same person in the picture that Aubrey shared on Instagram, in that the photo has been altered in an unflattering manner. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s clear to see that there are noticeable differences between the two photos.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><em>&ldquo;Aubrey has shared an unedited photo to put this issue to bed quickly. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;While it appears that body shaming has become the norm (e.g., comments were made earlier this year about Jason Momoa and are frequently made about female celebrities), Aubrey will not tolerate it, nor will she allow others to manipulate her image, and finds it sad that this is a newsworthy topic given the current climate of the world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Once again, we&#8217;ll have further updates on this story as more information becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>On the surface, MTV&#8217;s <em>Ex on the Beach</em> is just another anonymous reality show in which scantily-clad twentysomethings down fishbowl-sized cocktails and compete to exchange fluids.</p>
<p>And it might have gone down in flames alongside the disaster known as <a href="/2019/02/lindsay-lohans-beach-club-recap-it-just-keeps-getting-worse/"><em>Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s Beach Club</em></a>, were it not for the producers&#8217; brilliant idea of casting already-established nutjobs from previous series.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Teen Mom has-been Farrah Abraham spiced up the first season with her unique blend of nonsensical word salad and porn star chicanery.</p>
<p>And now, the similarly-psychotic Aubrey O&#8217;Day is being trotted out to spice up season 2:</p>
<p>You might remember Aubrey from her role on <em>Making the Band</em> or as the <a href="/2018/09/pauly-d-aubrey-oday-is-almost-as-crazy-as-ronnies-baby-mama/">ex-girlfriend of <em>Jersey Shore</em>&#8216;s Pauly D</a>.</p>
<p>But O&#8217;Day&#8217;s most recent tabloid headlines have to do with her affair with Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The president&#8217;s large adult son slept with O&#8217;Day several times while he was still married to Vanessa Trump.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/02/donald-trump-jr-finalizes-divorce-from-vanessa-trump/">Don Jr. and Vanessa got divorced</a> back in February, but Young Donald wasn&#8217;t single for long.</p>
<p>He began <a href="/2018/07/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-already-getting-engaged/">dating Fox News anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle</a> before the ink was dry on his divorce papers.</p>
<p>And in case you were one of the very few people who wondered exactly what Aubrey thought about all of this, fear not!&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Because we&#8217;re alive during the weirdest time in human history, you&#8217;re about to learn new details about the president&#8217;s son&#8217;s love life from an MTV reality show!</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/07/12/aubrey-oday-donald-trump-jr-soulmate-mtv-ex-on-the-beach/">new report</a> from TMZ, O&#8217;Day will talk about Don Jr. a <em>lot</em> during the upcoming season of <em>Ex</em>.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re guessing she didn&#8217;t need much coaxing in that direction, as DTJ seems to be her favorite topic of discussion!</p>
<p>TMZ sources who have viewed footage from upcoming episodes say Aubrey sounds off on all things&nbsp;Trump whenever she&#8217;s given the opportunity.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Apparently, she describes Don Jr. as her &quot;soul mate,&quot; and she bashes Guilfoyle as &quot;crazy-looking.&quot;</p>
<p>At one point, Aubrey even begs Don Jr. to dump Guilfoyle so that the two of them can get back together.</p>
<p>Something tells us that won&#8217;t be happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>For one thing, Guilfoyle has the presidential seal of approval, and it&#8217;s been rumored that she and Lil Donnie are quite serious these days.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On top of that, Vanessa Trump was pregnant during Don&#8217;s time with Aubrey, so you can bet he won&#8217;t be re-opening that scandalous chapter from his past with an election fast approaching.</p>
<p>But hey, if you believe Aubrey, the Trump political dynasty will soon be coming to an end regardless.</p>
<p>&quot;The White House fiasco is about to be over,&quot; she reportedly told MTV.</p>
<p>Maybe Aubrey knows something we don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Or maybe she&#8217;s just planning to transition into a career political pundit once the reality gigs dry up!</p>

<p>Of course, if you prefer to think of Pauly as a lovable smartass with hilarious hair, it&#8217;s best if you stick to <em>Jersey Shore</em> and avoid <em>Marriage Boot Camp</em> like the plague.</p>
<p>Over on <em>that</em> series, Pauly&#8217;s life involves less fist-pumping and more head-butting as he continues to lock horns with ex-girlfriend Aubrey O&#8217;Day.</p>
<p><a href="/2016/02/aubrey-oday-yup-im-banging-pauly-d/">Pauly and Aubrey dated&nbsp;</a>in 2016, and even though they&#8217;ve been broken up for quite some time, didn&#8217;t even date for that long, and have no real ties to one another, they&#8217;re still working on their &quot;relationship&quot; on MBC because money.</p>
<p>On Friday&#8217;s episode of the show, the always-melodramatic O&#8217;Day described her time with Pauly D as &quot;torturous.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Not surprisingly, Rhode Island&#8217;s premiere party-rocker took umbrage with that description.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very shocked,&quot; Pauly told <em>Page Six</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Oh wow, this was a bit dramatic. Torturous&#8217;? That&#8217;s an interesting word. If it was tortuous, why would you stay in a torturous relationship?&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#8217;m the one that left her,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>&quot;I think that&#8217;s a little bit fabricated but if that&#8217;s the way she feels, it&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;re not together anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>And Pauly&#8217;s not the only one who feels that way.</p>
<p>His <em>Shore</em> castmates have been quite outspoken about their distaste for O&#8217;Day, with Mike &quot;The Situation&quot; Sorrentino being particularly critical of the <em>Making the Band</em> alum:</p>
<p>&quot;He always has my back as my brother, and he sees that she&rsquo;s not the right one for me,&quot; Pauly said of Mike&#8217;s concerns.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I truly felt like I was involved in a situation that was extremely toxic and I did not understand why or how to get out of it,&quot; he adds.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Day, meanwhile, is defending her use of such a hyperbolic term to describe her relationship with Pauly:</p>
<p>&quot;I felt like that was the right term to use and it&#8217;s my journey and that&#8217;s the best term that I could think of to describe what I went through for two years,&quot; she tells<em> Page Six</em>.</p>
<p>Something tells us Pauly is happier than ever to be out of that relationship and back with his one true love &#8212; Vinny Guadagnino.</p>

<p>You remember that one, right?</p>
<p>The one we reported about back in March, which supposedly transpired after Trump learned O&#8217;Day had been sleeping with her husband and she literally called her out on the affair?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-682x1024.jpg" alt="Vanessa Trump" class="wp-image-292846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the time, we quoted sources that said Vanessa Trump had her children on the phone, something that seemed a bit inappropriate and out of line.</p>
<p>However, we&#8217;ve now learned new information about this supposed phone call&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; and it&#8217;s even more stunning!</p>
<p>According to Page Six sources, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/04/28/vanessa-trump-went-gangster-on-aubrey-oday-during-post-affair-phone-call/">Vanessa went full on &quot;gangster&quot;</a> when confronting the former Danity Kane artist about the relationship she had with Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p>Meaning what, exactly? Great question!</p>
<p>After discovering emails between her husband and O&#8217;Day, Vanessa dialed up Aubrey and &quot;said some extremely unladylike things to her,&quot; this outlet claims.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know the exact specifics, but&nbsp;the call &quot;involved the usually demure Vanessa comparing her and childless O&rsquo;Day&rsquo;s bodies and sexual capabilities in violently graphic terms,&quot; The New York Post writes here.</p>
<p>At the time of this affair, Vanessa and Donald Jr. had two kids together and Vanessa was pregnant with a third.</p>
<p>They now share five total children.</p>
<p>Based on what this insider alleges, we can only assume Vanessa was telling Aubrey that she can satisfy her man in bed better than O&#8217;Day can.</p>
<p>Which is great, you know? It&#8217;s important to have confidence in oneself.</p>
<p>But previous reports have claimed that the relationship between Donald Jr. and O&#8217;Day was not some lustful fling.</p>
<p>The stars supposedly <a href="/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-aubrey-oday-wanted-a-baby-sources-allege/">talked about starting a family together</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Wrote Us Weekly at one point:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don told Aubrey he wanted to have a baby with her. They were trying for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This would seem to imply that it didn&#8217;t matter back then whether Vanessa was more adventurous between the sheets than O&#8217;Day.</p>
<p>There were actual feelings involved between the singer and the son of the current President!</p>
<p>Of course, neither Donald Jr. nor O&#8217;Day has commented on this affair, which we heard took place between 2011 and 2012, around the time O&#8217;Day was a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice.</p>
<p>It ended, allegedly, after Donald Trump Sr. learned what was going on and told his son to cut it out.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A few days before news of the affair went viral, Vanessa and Donald Jr. announced the end of their marriage.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t related to the O&#8217;Day romance, of course, considering the couple recovered from that infidelity and stayed together for nearly six more years.</p>
<p>This is what the couple said upon announcing its divorce:</p>
<p><strong>After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways. We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time</strong>.</p>
<p>Did we also mention O&#8217;Day wrote a song about Trump?!?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Donald Trump Jr. is now a single man.</p>
<p>This is a fact, considering the President&#8217;s son and wife Vanessa Trump announced their divorce filing in the middle of last month.</p>
<p>Trump was also once in love with Aubrey O&#8217;Day, based on a number of recent celebrity gossip reports.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Therefore, when we combine the two statements above and then consider the latest photos O&#8217;Day shared on Instagram, we&#8217;re left with only one conclusion:</p>
<p>O&#8217;Day is clearly trying to win her ex-lover back over!</p>
<p>By now, you must have read the reports.</p>
<p>They were all over the Internet last week, with various tabloids alleging <a href="/2018/03/aubrey-oday-had-an-affair-with-donald-trump-jr-and-wrote-a-song/">O&#8217;Day and Trump Jr. carried on an affair</a> between 2011 and 2012, back when the former was a Celebrity Apprentice contestant and the latter served as an advisor on that show.</p>
<p>Neither O&#8217;Day nor Trump has commented on this claim, at least not publicly.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re pretty sure Aubrey confirmed the relationship way back in 2013 when she released a track titled &quot;DJT.&quot;</p>
<p>Take a listen to it here:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/aubrey-oday-sings-ode-to-donald-trump-jr-hear-it-here"></a></figure>
<p>Then, just a couple days ago, <a href="/2018/03/aubrey-oday-has-something-to-say-about-her-haters/">O&#8217;Day shared an intense selfie</a> and wrote as a caption to it:</p>
<p>&quot;Embrace the shade.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s clearly aware of the chatter making its way around the Internet and also aware of all the cruel things people are saying about her.</p>
<p>But she doesn&#8217;t seem to care, does she?</p>
<p>&quot;Happy Easter,&quot; O&#8217;Day simply wrote as a caption along with the first photo above, later adding another scantily-clad image to her account and penning along with it:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s fool.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Can we say for certain that these images were meant for Donald Trump Jr. to drool over</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>But an insider recently said that the romance between O&#8217;Day and Trump was no fling. It was so serious that the pair <a href="/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-and-aubrey-oday-wanted-a-baby-sources-allege/">discussed making a family together</a>!</p>
<p>&quot;Don told Aubrey he wanted to have a baby with her,&rdquo; an insider claimed to Us Weekly a bunch of days ago. &ldquo;They were trying for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This would be hilarious if true.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. would &quot;call Aubrey and leave long voicemails telling her he loved her over and over,&rdquo; this same tabloid wrote, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;He&rsquo;d cry and say he was nervous his wife would take the kids away.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-682x1024.jpg" alt="Vanessa Trump and Donald Trump Jr." class="wp-image-292850" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/vanessa-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Instead, however, Vanessa supposedly called up O&#8217;Day and told her to end the affair.</p>
<p>It finally <em>did</em> come to an end when Donald Trump Sr. delivered this same message to his son.</p>
<p>Last month, about six years later, the Trumps announced their divorce after 12 years and five kids together by stating the following:</p>
<p><strong>After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways. We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.</strong></p>
