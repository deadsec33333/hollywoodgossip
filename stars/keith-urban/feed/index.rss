<p>Is Nicole Kidman pregnant again? Will she have a 5th child?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the question asked time and time again of the Oscar winner. With two children with her husband, Keith Urban, and two grown kids with her ex, Tom Cruise, four kiddos might be the end of the road for her. She is, after all, 57.</p>



<p>Then again, nothing is impossible in Hollywood &#8212; and Nicole has gushed so heartily about being a mother that the time just might be right for the beloved star to think about expanding her family.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s let Nicole speak for herself, shall we?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-kidman-pregnant-a-look-back-at-early-motherhood-days">Nicole Kidman Pregnant: A Look Back At Early Motherhood Days</h2>



<p>&#8220;I love, love children. I love raising children,&#8221; Nicole shared with the <em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38560832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a></em> in 2017.</p>



<p>At the time, she was promoting her movie, <em>Lion</em>, a film that beautifully depicted the power of an adoptive mother&#8217;s&nbsp;love.</p>



<p>Nicole knows a little something about that first hand. </p>

<p>While she and then husband Tom Cruise tried to get pregnant with a child, during the marriage, the pair ended up adopting two children.</p>



<p>Daughter Isabella was adopted in 1992, followed by Connor&nbsp;in 1995.</p>



<p>After the couple split, Nicole remarried and started a family with Keith Urban. </p>



<p>These days, she does not have much contact with her adult children; to put it lightly, the relationships are strained. </p>



<p>In 2007, the age of 40, Nicole gave birth to their first biological daughter, Sunday. Her little sister, Faith MargaretÂ was born via surrogate two years later.</p>

<p>Of being a mom, Nicole admitted she finds the most joy in watching her kids &#8220;grow&#8221; and relishes in the wonderful things they &#8220;say and teach.&#8221; But in that BBC interview, she admitted that she really wanted more children with Keith. </p>



<p>&#8220;I would have liked probably two or three more children,&#8221; Nicole said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-kid-for-nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban">Another Kid For Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban</h2>



<p>So again we ask, is Nicole Kidman pregnant with her fifth child? No, that ship may have sailed. However, there has been talk of the power couple adopting more kids to add to their family. </p>



<p>According to those closest to her, Nicole still feels &#8220;young enough and has the energy for <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-adopting-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another baby</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nicole has had pregnancy and fertility problems in the past that kept her family smaller than she had hoped for,&#8221; a friend of the star told RadarOnline.com</p>



<p>&#8220;Nicole found she and Keith got so wrapped up in<a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nicole-kidman-excited-new-baby-mama-55-report-1711357#:~:text=%22Nicole%20has%20had%20pregnancy%20and,the%20couple%20told%20the%20newspaper." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> raising the kids</a>, she put the idea of adopting out of her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;But now that the girls are becoming more independent, she sees it&#8217;s time they really work on bringing another child into their home &#8211; and all the happiness that would bring to the family!&#8221;</p>



<p>While Nicole has not expressly said she and Keith are having another child, clearly being a mother is something she loves.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t count her out just yet! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nicole-playing-a-mother-on-screen">Nicole Playing A Mother On-Screen</h2>



<p>From the <em>Goldfinch</em>, to <em>Lion</em>, to <em>Boy Erased,</em> Nicole has played some exceptionally wonderful mother roles in her films.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the acclaimed film <em>Babygirl</em>, one of her most recent projects is a dramatic miniseries called <em>Expats</em> for Amazon. In the series, produced by Nicole and her company Blossom Films, she&#8217;ll play a mother named Margaret in terrible distress. </p>



<p>Margaret rides an emotional roller coaster after her son goes missing in a Hong Kong night market. </p>



<p>Understanding the ferocity of love as a mother herself, Nicole revealed she could relate, even if it was a difficult role.  </p>



<p>âShe will not give up hope, which was probably the thing I related toâthat desire to go, âNo, I know deep down, my child is out there and Iâll find my child,ââ Kidman said of her&nbsp;<em>Expats</em>&nbsp;character in an <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a60134221/nicole-kidman-interview-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with <em>Elle</em></a>.</p>



<p> âSheâs got this dogged refusal to accept anyone that tells her differently. She just wonât stop. And thatâs what I think I empathized with.â</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Why is Keith Urban comparing Miley Cyrus to an ashtray? And why is he insisting it&#8217;s a compliment?!</p>



<p>Miley Cyrus is talented, accomplished, and intensely famous. She&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/miley-cyrus-is-idol-producers-first-choice-to-replace-katy-perry-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in high demand</a>, she&#8217;s a target of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/donald-trump-shades-miley-cyrus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vitriol from disgraced former presidents</a>, and she&#8217;s worked hard to get to where she is.</p>



<p>Keith Urban is best known as Nicole Kidman&#8217;s husband, but he is also a Country music star. When he has music opinions, people listen.</p>



<p>Comparing Miley Cyrus to an ashtray is a <em>choice</em>. But it&#8217;s not necessarily an insult. Is this really a compliment?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-keith-urban-say-about-miley-cyrus">What did Keith Urban say about Miley Cyrus?</h2>



<p>During a recent episode of Nova 96.9&#8217;s <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/KeithUrban_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fitzy and Wippa </em>with Kate Ritchie</a> in Sydney, Keith Urban spoke about the beloved singer.</p>



<p>He praised that he has &#8220;always loved Miley,&#8221; which is the correct way to feel about Miley Cyrus. Despite some mistakes and missteps in her life, she&#8217;s been a vocal force for good.</p>



<p>I love that voice, man, that voice,&#8221; Keith Urban then said of Miley Cyrus. &#8220;She sounds like an ashtray.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus on February 4, 2024." class="wp-image-508613" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Miley Cyrus performs on stage during the 66th Annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on February 4, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A <em>what </em>now?</p>



<p>&#8220;And I mean that as a compliment,&#8221; Keith Urban quickly clarified about his &#8220;ashtray&#8221; comment about Miley Cyrus.</p>



<p>&#8220;She sounds like the carpet at the RSL!&#8221; he then added. RSL refers to Returned and Services League, a gathering place for veterans and current military personnel. Presumably, he is implying that such places are havens for cigarette smokers. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="676" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-1024x676.jpg" alt="Keith Urban on June 8, 2024." class="wp-image-508614" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-1024x676.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-768x507.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-2048x1351.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-960x633.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-1080x713.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_02-1200x792.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Keith Urban performs onstage during the 2024 CMA Music festival at the Nissan Stadium on June 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-ashtray-a-compliment-in-any-form">How is &#8216;ashtray&#8217; a compliment in any form?</h2>



<p>Ashtrays are unsightly fixtures of a thankfully bygone era. There was a time when they sat on restaurant tables, in doctor&#8217;s waiting rooms, and in office buildings &#8212; each a location filled with a foul smell and a haze of smoke.</p>



<p>But when Keith Urban said that Miley Cyrus had a voice like an ashtray, it&#8217;s clear that he did not mean it as an insult.</p>



<p>Rather, it seems that he was praising her for her distinct, raspy voice. Though there are many ways to have a raspy voice, cigarettes systematically damage many parts of the human body, and sometimes result in deep, hoarse voices. Thus the expression of a person having a &#8220;voice like an ashtray.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="728" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-1024x728.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus looking gorgeous despite terrible hair at the 2024 Grammy Awards." class="wp-image-508615" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-1024x728.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-300x213.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-768x546.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-2048x1455.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-960x682.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-1080x768.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_mileycyrus_02-1200x853.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Miley Cyrus attends the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Keith Urban has put his fondness for Miley&#8217;s music on display. </p>



<p>Multiple times, he has performed covers of &#8220;Flowers&#8221; at his own shows. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0">Covering a song is, with the rarest of exceptions, always a sign of flattery. Keith Urban very clearly loves Miley Cyrus&#8217; music &#8230; and her &#8220;ashtray&#8221; voice.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Keith Urban on May 6, 2024." class="wp-image-508616" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0905_keithurban_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Keith Urban attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-has-high-praise-for-other-singers-too">He has high praise for other singers, too</h2>



<p>In April of 2024, Keith Urban sang the praises of Taylor Swift&#8217;s <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> songwriting while <a href="https://people.com/keith-urban-dishes-on-extraordinary-taylor-swift-ariana-grande-obsession-exclusive-8645131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to</a> <em>People</em>.</p>



<p>He also gushed over Ariana Grande&#8217;s &#8220;We Can&#8217;t Be Friends,&#8221; likening it to &#8220;audible heroin&#8221; that he simply couldn&#8217;t quit.</p>



<p>This is where we see that Keith Urban is clearly a decent guy with great taste in music. We also see that he pretty consistently comes up with colorful, seemingly unflattering analogies when he&#8217;s showering other singers with compliments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Hollywood marriages aren&#8217;t always built to last.</p>



<p>For a whole host of reasons, from busy schedules to way too many resources to certain temperaments to looks and wealth and rumors &#8230; celebrity relationships tend to crumble before our eyes.</p>



<p>So it makes sense that when you last a long time, you want to show it off. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are doing just that with a series of adorable&nbsp;selfies &#8212; because they&#8217;re celebrating their 11th&nbsp;anniversary.</p>



<p>To be clear, 11 years is a long time to stay together for a regular, run-of-the-mill, non-celebrity married couple.</p>



<p>In Hollywood years, it&#8217;s like these two have been married for the better part of a century.</p>



<p>But somehow Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban (the one who isn&#8217;t Nicole Kidman) have managed it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="680" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-680x1024.jpg" alt="Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the CMTs" class="wp-image-267461" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-1360x2048.jpg 1360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-735x1107.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-222x335.jpg 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-230x347.jpg 230w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-345x520.jpg 345w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-425x640.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-510x768.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-637x960.jpg 637w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-717x1080.jpg 717w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-at-the-cmts-scaled.jpg 1700w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban pose for photographers here at the 2017 CMTs Awards in Nashville.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And they&#8217;ve done so despite <a href="/2017/05/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-what-prompted-their-biggest-fight/">major disagreements about where to live</a>. That takes work.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the baggage that they have.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t just mean regular relationship baggage or fame baggage.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t even mean the fact that the Oscar-winning actress and the Crunchy &#8230; sorry, <em>Country </em>music singer come from different worlds.</p>



<p>(Like, <a href="/2017/06/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-still-together-closer-than-ever/">Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are closer than ever</a> and they also come from different worlds)</p>



<p>Nicole Kidman also had a famous relationship with Tom Cruise.</p>



<p>The rest of her life is haunted by the specter of Scientology.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t speak about the Church, but we all know how this works.</p>



<p>The kids that she and Tom adopted together are still Scientologists.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re adults, but were Nicole to ever speak ill of the Church or very likely of Tom, she&#8217;d be declared a Suppressive Person, and she&#8217;d never get to see them.</p>



<p>It can be a strain to be interviewed constantly and have to give a tight-lipped smile when people ask about a subject that makes you want to scream.</p>

Moreover, Kidman was once married to Cruise, so these same critics think she&#8217;s open to arrange marriages.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty Images for CMT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And that tension from walking a verbal tightrope can impact both members of a couple.</p>



<p>But it looks like they&#8217;re not letting it touch them.</p>



<p>Also, though they&#8217;re both celebrities, there&#8217;s something of a fame disparity between the two.</p>



<p>Because Nicole Kidman isn&#8217;t a niche celebrity. She&#8217;s, you know, world-famous as an actress.</p>



<p>Toby Keith sometimes gets confused with another Country singer by people who aren&#8217;t in that particular music fandom.</p>



<p>Remember, Keith Urban is the one married to Nicole Kidman.</p>



<p><em>Toby Keith</em>&nbsp;is the one who played for an all-male audience in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>(Toby Keith Urban is their fused state, and can fly, but they only combine in real emergencies)</p>



<p>But Keith and Nicole look happy and also way younger than they actually are.</p>



<p>Because Nicole is 50 and Keith is 49.</p>



<p>Does time mean nothing to these two?</p>



<p>Yeah, these two are really adorable.</p>



<p>Some other couples have lasted for a really long time, but in a world where <a href="/2016/09/angelina-jolie-files-for-divorce-from-brad-pitt/">Brangelina&nbsp;is divorcing</a>, staying married means really beating the odds.</p>



<p>(Though rumor has it that <a href="/2017/06/brad-pitt-using-custody-talks-to-win-back-angelina-jolie/">Brad Pitt is hoping to win back Angelina Jolie</a>, so &#8230; we&#8217;ll see how that goes)</p>



<p>Yeah, these are really adorable.</p>



<p>Also, who says that old people can&#8217;t be cute, you know?</p>



<p>And, not for nothing, but this is such a level-headed, grounded way of celebrating an anniversary.</p>



<p>As far as we know, they didn&#8217;t swim around in a champagne pool or do any other ridiculous rich people stuff.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re together for over a decade, sometimes happiness with your partnership is just <em>enough</em>, you know?</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need all of the rest.</p>
