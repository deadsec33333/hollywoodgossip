										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Sarah Palin has an important message to share.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily a message one may have expected to hear from Palin, considering her background as an outspoken member of the Republican Party who has prided herself on clapping back against the so-called mainstream media&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; but this just makes it an even <em>more</em> important message, based on the source and her fans.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Simply put,&nbsp;Sarah Palin really wants you to wear a mask.</p>
<p>The former governor of Alaska &#8212; who <em>also</em> ran as the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and who has <em>also</em> appeared on Teen Mom OG &#8212; says she has contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a statement to People Magazine, v added that other family members, including 12-year-old son Trig, can say unfortunately the same.</p>
<p>And this only proves that &quot;anyone&quot; can catch the virus, she says, which is both an obvious point and also a very narcissistic one.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;As confident as I&#8217;d like to be about my own health, and despite my joking that I&#8217;m blessed to constantly breathe in the most sterile (frozen!) air, my case is perhaps one of those that proves anyone can catch this,&quot; <a href="https://people.com/politics/sarah-palin-tests-positive-coronavirus-urges-others-wear-masks/">Palin told People</a>.</p>
<p>Palin explained that one of her daughters recently woke up without a sense of taste&#8230; received a positive diagnosis&#8230; and was immediately quarantined.</p>
<p>&quot;I then observed symptoms in my son Trig, who curiously is the most enthusiastic mask-wearer, and after our numerous negative tests over the year, he tested positive,&quot; Palin continued.</p>
<p>Trig was born with Down syndrome, it should be noted, and kids with special needs are especially vulnerable to COVID.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>From there, the 12-year old was also placed in quarantine.</p>
<p>Alas, Palin eventually came down with a slight fever and sore muscles and even had what she describes now as&nbsp; &quot;bizarre&quot; symptoms characteristic of the virus.</p>
<p>Such as?</p>
<p>A loss of taste and smell, leading her to assume it was &quot;unmistakable COVID caught me.&quot;</p>

<p>Palin told the publication that COVID-19 can &quot;really knock you down&quot; and went farther than most others in her political party, actively encouraging folks to remain vigilant about public health amid the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>&quot;I strongly encourage everyone to use common sense to avoid spreading this and every other virus out there,&quot; she said in her statement.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more viruses than there are stars in the sky, meaning we&#8217;ll never avoid every source of illness or danger&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;But please be vigilant, don&#8217;t be frightened, and I advise reprioritizing some personal time and resources to ensure as healthy a lifestyle as you can create so when viruses do hit, you have at least some armor to fight it.&quot;</p>

<p>She concluded:</p>
<p>&quot;I view wearing that cumbersome mask indoors in a crowd as not only allowing the newfound luxury of being incognito, but trust it&#8217;s better than doing nothing to slow the spread.&quot;</p>
<p>The sentiment there is appreciated, but Palin just used many fancy words to say something very basic &#8212; which is this:</p>
<p><strong><em>BE A GOOD PERSON AND WEAR A MASK!</em></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to data compiled by The New York Times, more than 550,000 people have died due to COVID-19 in the United States, with more than 30 million confirmed cases since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>With an uptick in variants of the original virus across the nation, America still has a long way to go until a majority of citizens are in the clear.</p>
<p>Keep wearing a mask, keep acting in a responsible manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, you guys, if Sarah Palin can get COVID, <em>anyone</em> can!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Several years ago, during her run for Vice President of the United States, Sarah Palin mocked Barack Obama for a platform based on &quot;hope and change.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, well over a decade later, however, the unintelligent former politican&#8217;s daughter says she is gonna rely on hope in the wake of a major life change:</p>
<p>The divorce of her parents.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday afternoon, <a href="/2019/09/sarah-palin-files-for-divorce-from-husband-todd/">Sarah and Todd Palin announced they were splitting</a> after 31 years of marriage.</p>
<p>In documents filed in Anchorage Superior Court late last week, Sarah cited &quot;incompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife&quot; as the cause of the split.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p>These two are totally sick of being married to each other!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll refrain from making any jokes here about how it took Todd so long to arrive at such a conclusion.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sarah, of course, rose to national prominence after she was selected by John McCain to serve as his running mate in the 2008 presidential election.</p>
<p>The pair lost to Barack Obama and Joe Biden and then Palin resigned as governor of Alaska after just three years in office, in order to focus on a career in media.</p>
<p>She served as a Fox News correspondent for awhile and now&#8230; just Tweets sometimes, we guess.</p>
<p>But daughter Bristol appeared on Dancing with the Stars and also anchored her own short-lived reality show and then actually joined <a href="/categories/teen-mom-og/">Teen Mom OG</a> last year.</p>
<p>We still can&#8217;t believe that happened.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday morning, meanwhile, Bristol shared on her Instagram Story a sermon from a Texas pastor called &ldquo;Abounding in Hope,&rdquo; a reference to a line in the Bible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely safe to assume she did so because she knew that news of her parents&#8217; break-up would soon go viral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When hope is present, people are encouraged to lay hold of what heaven has for them,&rdquo; Christian Life Austin Pastor Rex Johnson says in the sermon, from March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some have referred to hope as the &lsquo;middle sister&rsquo; of faith and love,&rdquo; he also says in it. &ldquo;I like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah and Todd Palin met as high school students in Wasilla, Alaska and eloped in 1988.</p>
<p>They five children together, including Bristol &#8212; and Todd is seeking joint custody of 11-year old Trig, the only kid who still lives at home.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bristol, for her part, was also once married.</p>
<p>She divorced Dakota Meyer in 2018, however, with nearly every moment Bristol spent on screen as a Teen Mom devoted to problems between the then-couple.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/04/bristol-palin-confirms-teen-mom-og-departure-will-be-missed-by-e/">Palin quit the MTV show in April</a>, jumping up high on her pedstal and stating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teen mom OG wasn&rsquo;t a fit for me, it took away my peace.. and honestly &ndash; my peace has a price tag that no one but God can afford&#8230;</p>
<p>&ldquo;$ doesn&rsquo;t impress me, I don&rsquo;t entertain bs, and walking away from this show allows God to rebuild me (and my little fam) in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>As for her fellow Teen Mom stars?</p>
<p>&quot;I have love for all the girls on the show, and wish them the best of luck in all their future endeavors!! xoxo, B,&quot; she concluded.</p>

She was really pissed over this.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Sarah Tried to Help</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">2</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>&#8220;That bare empty room?&#8221; said Sarah. &#8220;Of course, that was a symbolic thing that he did there. That&#8217;s heartbreaking, Bristol.&#8221;</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Fighting Words</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">3</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Bristol told her mom that Meyer also asked for her ring back, saying to his wife: &#8220;You better get your mama&#8217;s money, because I&#8217;m gonna fight you tooth and nail until the girls are 18.&#8221;</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>How Will We Move Forward?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">4</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>&#8220;The thing that I worry about, is how are we going to learn to communicate as coparents and putting our kids first and not having petty arguments?&#8221; wondered Bristol.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Meyer Loses It</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">5</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Bristol asked Dakota if he would be home when she got back from a trip to Los Angeles, which set him OFF. &#8220;She&#8217;s a f-cking smart ass isn&#8217;t she? She&#8217;s an obnoxious smart ass,&#8221; Meyer vented to a producer. &#8220;&#8216;Oh, so you&#8217;re gonna be there all week?&#8217; It&#8217;s my house. What am I gonna do, for 8 days, go find another place to stay?

I get upset about it because I have another 16 years to have to communicate to a human being like this about my daughters.&#8221;</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>At Least Things are Better with Levi Johnston</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">7</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Later on, Bristol met up with the father of her first child; his wife Sunny; and their two daughters, Breeze and Indy. She did so to hand over son Tripp. They made small talk, but it was rather uncomfortable. &#8220;One awkward situation done today,&#8221; noted Bristol after the handoff.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>What About Catelynn and Tyler?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">8</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Catelynn said on air that things remained &#8220;tense&#8221; between her and her husband after her return from treatment, adding that she wasn&#8217;t prepared to dive into couple&#8217;s counseling just yet as he wanted them to.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Enter&#8230; Butch?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">9</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Most the episode, though, centered on Tyler and his sister, Amber, reuniting with their dad, Butch, was in rehab and was ready to make amends to his family members after completing six months of treatment.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p><em>Teen Mom OG</em> has added Bristol Palin, and <a href="/slideshows/teen-mom-og-premiere-recap-welcome-to-the-dysfunctional-family/">Bristol&#8217;s family dysfunctions</a> are obvious.</p>
<p>But apparently what viewers are seeing on camera is only the tip of the Alaskan iceberg.</p>
<p>A new report says that Bristol&#8217;s family is clashing &#8212; and Bristol&#8217;s new TV role is at the center of their feud.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p><em>RadarOnline</em>&#8216;s inside source has revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2018/10/teen-mom-og-bristol-palin-filming-causes-family-feud/">Bristol Palin&#8217;s family</a>&nbsp;is being torn apart by her new role on&nbsp;<em>Teen Mom OG</em>.</p>
<p>Some within her divided family think that it&#8217;s a &quot;great opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>After all, this way, Bristol gets exposure and a hefty source of income &#8212; we know how sweet that&nbsp;<em>Teen Mom</em>&nbsp;money can be.</p>
<p>Not everyone is onboard with Bristol&#8217;s newly revived reality TV career, however.</p>
<p>And apparently the biggest critic of her casting is her new brother-in-law, Ricky Bailey.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ricky married Bristol&#8217;s sister, Willow, just days ago in what was reportedly a sweet ceremony in Alaska.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/10/bristol-palin-ditches-sisters-wedding-humiliates-famous-family/">Bristol ditched the ceremony</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently her issue was over her brother, Track, being invited.</p>
<p><a href="/2017/12/track-palin-sarahs-son-arrested-on-domestic-violence-charges-aga/">Track has a history of arrests for domestic violence</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not-so-fun fact: he ended up missing Willow&#8217;s wedding himself because he was arrested for domestic violence&nbsp;<em>yet again</em>.</p>
<p>But Bristol skipping the wedding is only&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;factor in her current family troubles.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(TLC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Ricky is so against having cameras around,&quot; the insider reveals.</p>
<p>MTV&#8217;s cameras followed Bristol for Willow&#8217;s bachelorette weekend in Arizona, and it wasn&#8217;t exactly Willow&#8217;s dream come true.</p>
<p>&quot;Willow didn&rsquo;t approve of the cameras filming for her bachelorette weekend,&quot; the source says.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; the insider continues, she &quot;ended up giving in to Bristol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was more of a favor,&quot; the source characterizes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That favor ended up costing Willow.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the conversations during Willow&rsquo;s bachelorette weekend ended up being all about Bristol,&quot; the insider reports.</p>
<p>That is very natural when cameras are present.</p>
<p>It also just &#8230; sucks for Willow.</p>
<p>&quot;It was so sad for Willow,&quot; the source laments.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to the Palin family&#8217;s concerns than intrusive cameras.</p>
<p>Apparently Track isn&#8217;t the only family member who loses it sometimes.</p>
<p>&quot;Bristol&rsquo;s siblings believe she is totally crazy and really volatile,&quot; the insider says.</p>
<p>&quot;Her family knows Bristol is trying to keep it together for the&nbsp;<em>Teen Mom</em>&nbsp;cameras,&quot; the source acknowledges.</p>
<p>However, they allegedly fear that it is &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before Bristol totally loses her composure while the cameras are rolling.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Bristol has been posting about a fresh start now that it is finally October.</p>
<p>Bristol took to Instagram to write that it is a &quot;new month.&quot;</p>
<p>She said that this means that she has a &quot;new slate.&quot;</p>
<p>(She probably means fresh slate or clean slate, but let&#8217;s not get nitpicky)</p>
<p>Bristol may not see eye to eye with her family on everything. That&#8217;s normal.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ve all seen relationships and families fall apart at the seams while they appear on reality television. Will the Palins be next?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Sacha Baron Cohen is the man behind <em>Borat </em>and therefore the man responsible for the catchphrases of all of your most annoying friends over the past decade.</p>
<p>This time, he staged a satirical interview with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.</p>
<p>Palin, who&#8217;s been in enough disastrous interviews to recognize them, caught on, and unleashed a scathing attack on Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;evil&#8221; humor.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="833" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-833x1024.jpg" alt="Sacha Baron Cohen Image" class="wp-image-15111" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-833x1024.jpg 833w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-244x300.jpg 244w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-768x944.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-735x904.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-272x335.jpg 272w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-282x347.jpg 282w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-423x520.jpg 423w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-521x640.jpg 521w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-625x768.jpg 625w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-781x960.jpg 781w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image-878x1080.jpg 878w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-image.jpg 976w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup &#8211; we were duped,&#8221; Palin&#8217;s post begins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah announces: &#8220;I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick &#8216;humor&#8217; of the British &#8216;comedian&#8217; Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait, she&#8217;s really going with <em>evil </em>for this? This isn&#8217;t just a matter of people in glass houses &#8212; most people wouldn&#8217;t say that a fake interview deserves that label.</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8216;legit opportunity&#8217; to honor American Vets and contribute to a &#8216;legit Showtime historical documentary&#8217; was requested of me via a speakers bureau,&#8221; Palin says.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Some would suggest that, had the offer been <em>truly </em>legitimate, no one would have asked Sarah Palin to make an appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;For my interview,&#8221; Palin explains. &#8220;My daughter and I were asked to travel across the country where Cohen (I presume) had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran, fake wheelchair and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cohen&#8217;s taste has always been questionable, as we&#8217;ll explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform,&#8221; Palin continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sat through a long &#8220;interview&#8221; full of Hollywoodism’s disrespect and sarcasm,&#8221; Palin says.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know what a <em>Hollywoodism </em>is supposed to mean in this context, but we imagine that whatever fans she still has will love the term.</p>
<p>&#8220;But finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out,&#8221; Palin describes. &#8220;Much to Cohen’s chagrin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Palin writes: &#8220;The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohen’s foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is my challenge, shallow Sacha boy,&#8221; Palin suggests. &#8220;Go ahead &#8211; air the footage. Experience tells us it will be heavily edited, not pretty, and intended to humiliate.&#8221;</p>
<p>His whole schtick is seeing what people will say and how they will react, so, yeah, of course it&#8217;s intended to humiliate.</p>

<p>&#8220;The challenge is to Cohen, CBS, and Showtime,&#8221; Palin says. &#8220;Donate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure how one gauges proceeds from a Showtime series.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night,&#8221; Palin allows.</p>
<p>Interesting that Sarah Palin considers either herself or her daughter to be innocent public personalities.</p>
<p>&#8220;But HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country?!&#8221; Palin asks.</p>
<p>She then says that this was: &#8220;Truly sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as an aside,&#8221; Palin notes. &#8220;For further insight into the wealthy corporate enablers of this kind of &#8216;joke.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cohen/CBS/Showtime production team purposefully dropped my daughter and me off at the wrong Washington, DC airport after the fake interview,&#8221; Palin claims. &#8220;Knowing we’d miss all flights back home to Alaska.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite the accusation &#8212; of downright maliciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;After refusing to take our calls to help get us out of the bind they’d put us in for three days,&#8221; Palin describes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote this off as yet another example of the sick nature that is media-slash-entertainment today.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="594" height="396" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/donald-trump-sarah-palin-photo.jpg" alt="Donald Trump, Sarah Palin Photo" class="wp-image-222321" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/donald-trump-sarah-palin-photo.jpg 594w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/donald-trump-sarah-palin-photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/donald-trump-sarah-palin-photo-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/donald-trump-sarah-palin-photo-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/donald-trump-sarah-palin-photo-520x347.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Palin has been frustrated with media and entertainment ever since they asked her questions about government policies in interviews while she was McCain&#8217;s running mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feel good and manly about your M.O., Sacha?&#8221; Palin asks.</p>
<p>In Palin&#8217;s world, of course, demonstrating masculinity is prized, so she assumes that Sacha Baron Cohen is preoccupied with a desire to feel manly.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, my daughter thinks you’re a piece of ****, Sacha.&#8221; Palin says.</p>
<p>Her daughter, Bristol, thinks a lot of things about a lot of people. She also blogs about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every honorable American Vet should feel the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that by saying every honorable American vet, she brings the No True Scottsman paradox into play.</p>
<p>So the inevitable <em>I&#8217;m a vet and I&#8217;m thrilled that she got played</em> responses can be countered with <em>ah, then you&#8217;re not an honorable one</em>.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin is no one&#8217;s favorite person, but Sacha Baron Cohen can be controversial himself.</p>
<p>The arguments to defend him are that he does what he does to elicit genuine responses from people, to see what they will say with the right prompting.</p>

<p>But his work often relies upon shock value, the perpetuation of horrific racist stereotypes, and crude jokes.</p>
<p>That said, whatever you think of either of them, there&#8217;s one thing about which we can all agree:</p>
<p>Sarah Palin just gave Cohen&#8217;s work, which includes a series of interviews with some very famous politicians on both sides of the aisle, better publicity than anyone could have imagined.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t normally advocate doing nice things for Sarah Palin, but perhaps Showtime should send her a fruit basket.</p>
