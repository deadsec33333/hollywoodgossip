<p>Ellen Pompeo is scrubbing out of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>In a way she never has before.</p>



<p>The actress is currently starting in Good American Family, a brand new drama on Hulu whose first two episodes were made available on March 19.</p>



<p>The role marks Pompeo&#8217;s first lead since she sky-rocketed to fame back in 2005 as Meredith Grey, the title character of the longest-running medical drama in TV history.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521678" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ellen Pompeo attends the Special Premiere of Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;Good American Family&#8221; at Directors Guild Of America on March 13, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/ellen-pompeo-reveals-the-real-reason-why-shes-leaving-greys-anatomy/">Pompeo pared down her screen time</a> significantly on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8230; although she still serves as a producer and still makes the occasional cameo.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. I just knew that I really couldn&#8217;t do Grey&#8217;s anymore,&#8221; Pompeo explained this week on the Call Her Daddy podcast of that decision. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was to the point where I really just felt like an animal at the zoo. I&#8217;m a big believer in destiny. I thought, if there&#8217;s something else I&#8217;m meant to do, it&#8217;s gonna find me. But I know I have to leave this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pompeo, who earned $20 million per episode in her last ABC contract, had hinted in the past that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/ellen-pompeo-im-getting-ready-to-quit-acting/">she was done with acting</a>.</p>



<p>But here she is again.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="921" height="624" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo as Meredith" class="wp-image-454474" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg 921w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-768x520.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-735x498.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-335x227.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-347x235.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-520x352.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-640x434.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meredith seeks advice from Amelia in this Grey&#8217;s Anatomy scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes you know you&#8217;d like opportunities to come while you&#8217;re doing something, so you have an easy exit,&#8221; the actress said on this podcast. &#8220;You have a soft landing &#8211; and it turns out I actually <em>did</em> get a soft landing. But I was sort of thinking like nothing&#8217;s coming along, and I really believe in this town, if they want you, they will find you.&#8221;</p>



<p>When a new offer didn&#8217;t immediately present itself, Pompeo began to have some doubts. As anyone would. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on TV for 20 years, the biggest show ever, like everybody knows who I am. &#8220;Clearly, these people don&#8217;t want me,&#8221; she said of her feelings at the time. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not coming for me. No one&#8217;s offering me this [and] no one&#8217;s offering me that. I mean I&#8217;ve been offered a few things, obviously, but like could never make it work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good American Family stars Ellen Pompeo, Mark Duplass, Imogen Faith Reid, Dulé Hill, Christina Hendricks, Sarayu Blue and Jenny O&#8217;Hara.</p>



<p>It is based on a true story and here is the official synopsis:</p>



<p><em>Told from multiple points of view, as a means to explore issues of perspective, bias, and trauma, this compelling drama is inspired by the disturbing stories surrounding a Midwestern couple who adopts a girl with a rare form of dwarfism.</em></p>



<p><em>But as they begin to raise her alongside their three biological children, mystery emerges around her age and background, and they slowly start to suspect she may not be who she says she is. </em></p>



<p><em>As they defend their family from the daughter they&#8217;ve grown to believe is a threat, she fights her own battle to confront her past and what her future holds, in a showdown that ultimately plays out in the tabloids and the courtroom.</em></p>

<p>In the past, it was challenging for the star to step away from a program that shot for 10 months a year.</p>



<p>According to Pompeo, though, times have changed and &#8220;it&#8217;s become a little easier&#8221; to take on other roles since networks have reduced their orders to 15 episodes. </p>



<p>&#8220;But anyway, I had really stepped away, and I had said I really have to step away I can&#8217;t do it anymore,&#8221; she added on the podcast. </p>



<p>&#8220;And if nothing else comes, nothing else comes. It&#8217;s my destiny. [If] no one wants me, that&#8217;s okay, I can swallow that pill like I swallow everything else and at least I&#8217;m financially okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy is making sure that everyone&#8217;s wait will be worth their while.</p>



<p>Due to the recent writers and actors&#8217; strikes, the premiere of this beloved ABC drama has been pushed back until March 14.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the bad news.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the good news&#8230;</p>

<p>In a preview of upcoming installment, <a href="https://people.com/ellen-pompeo-marks-greys-anatomy-return-in-season-20-first-look-exclusive-8419899">published online by People Magazine</a>, the veteran actress will reprise this role as soon as the program returns &#8212; despite NOT being listed as a series regular for the first time in history.</p>



<p>&#8220;How long do I have to wait?&#8221; Meredith asks in the trailer before the scene shifts to a shot of the surgical interns getting ready for a new day. </p>



<p>&#8220;What are you waiting for? Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; Miranda Bailey then calls.</p>

<p>While walking the halls of the famous hospital, Miranda also tells Meredith: &#8220;The interns are in trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s pretty much all we get as far as Meredith is concerned; viewers will need to tune in to find out exactly what she&#8217;ll be up to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/greys-anatomy-renewed-for-historic-20th-season/">on Season 20</a>.</p>



<p>The star already went with a scaled-back role for season 19, although she remains as an executive producer on the show moving forward, in addition to providing the opening and closing voiceover for each and every episode.</p>



<p>On an edition of Variety&#8217;s Actors on Actors series, Pompeo recently opened up to her former Grey’s costar Katherine Heigl about the future of her character.</p>

She will make appearances on Season 20.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I will be making some appearances hopefully next year, if I can find some time,” she said at the time. “It’s not a complete goodbye. And I think we’ve got an interesting story to tell.&#8221;</p>



<p>In August 2022, we learned that Pompeo would no longer anchor Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>She had previously hinted that she was ready to move on, admirably admitting that executives convinced her to stay over the years by throwing lots of money at her.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo in the Hospital" class="wp-image-409846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-735x679.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-335x310.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-347x321.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-520x481.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-640x592.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ellen Pompeo peeks her head into a room here as the beloved character of Meredith Grey.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been trying to focus on convincing everybody that it should end,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">Pompeo told Insider while promoting</a> her company Betr Remedies in late 2021.</p>



<p>However, ratings scarcely dipped and ABC offered Pompeo $20 million per year for Seasons 17 and 18 and, well&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;​I feel like I’m the super naive one who keeps saying, ‘But what’s the story going to be, what story are we going to tell?’&#8221; Pompeo added in this new interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;And everyone’s like, ‘Who cares, Ellen? It makes a gazillion dollars.’&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="914" height="954" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale.png" alt="Ellen Pompeo on the Finale" class="wp-image-344914" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale.png 914w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-287x300.png 287w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-768x802.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-735x767.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-321x335.png 321w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-332x347.png 332w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-498x520.png 498w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-613x640.png 613w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-736x768.png 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ellen Pompeo looks down in this scene from the emotional Grey&#8217;s Anatomy season finale.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>About a year ago, Pompeo explained her decision as follows:</p>



<p>“I gotta mix it up a little bit.</p>



<p>“I’m 53, my brain is like scrambled eggs. I gotta do something new. You can’t do The New York Times crossword puzzle every single day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Added <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/ellen-pompeo-reveals-the-real-reason-why-shes-leaving-greys-anatomy/">Pompeo back then to Drew Barrymore</a>:</p>



<p>“I mean, 19 years, that’s more than people keep their kids in their house, like people keep their kids in their house until they’re 18 and then they send them off to college.</p>



<p>“So this is like me like going away to college.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>The doctor is about to check out of the hospital.</p>



<p>And she&#8217;s here to explain why.</p>



<p>Months after news broke that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/greys-anatomy-shocker-ellen-pompeo-to-barely-appear-on-season-19/">Ellen Pompeo would only appear</a> on a handful of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy episodes this season, the veteran actress appeared as a guest on The Drew Barrymore Show this week.</p>



<p>Sitting across from the host, Pompeo spoke in length for the first time about this stunning decision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">We still can&#8217;t believe Ellen Pompeo has left Grey&#8217;s Anatomy. What will the show be without her?!?!?!?!?!??</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I gotta mix it up a little bit,&#8221; Pompeo said, referring to a role she&#8217;s portrayed for over 17 seasons.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 53, my brain is like scrambled eggs. I gotta do something new. You can&#8217;t do The New York Times crossword puzzle every single day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pompeo, of course, has been rather unspoken for years now about this need.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s openly said on multiple occasions that she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">anxious for Grey&#8217;s Anatomy to end</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Pompeo has scrubbed in as the main role of Meredith Grey for nearly two decades.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, 19 years, that’s more than people keep their kids in their house, like people keep their kids in their house until they’re 18 and then they send them off to college,&#8221; she explained to Barrymore. </p>



<p>&#8220;So this is like me like going away to college.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the winter finale of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/greys-anatomy-faces-a-massive-fire-shocking-character-exit/">Meredith made the decision</a> to move to Boston; she&#8217;ll appear on the first episode in 2023 and after that&#8230; who knows?!?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png" alt="Pompeo" class="wp-image-412644" width="496" height="445" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png 496w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-300x269.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-335x301.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-347x311.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I have a lot that I&#8217;m doing,&#8221; said Pompeo, of her upcoming professional plans, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have three kids, so I take care of them. It&#8217;s really important for me to be around for them and be more present for them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, Pompeo and husband Chris Ivery are parents Stella, 13, Sienna, 8, and Eli, 6.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo in the Hospital" class="wp-image-409846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-735x679.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-335x310.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-347x321.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-520x481.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-640x592.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ellen Pompeo peeks her head into a room here as the beloved character of Meredith Grey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pompeo posted on Instagram November 17 about stepping back from Grey&#8217;s, passing along her gratitude to longtime fans for their support over this wildly impressive run as the anchor of a consistently highly-rated show.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am eternally grateful and humbled by the love and support you have all shown me, Meredith GREY and the show for 19 seasons!&#8221; the star wrote at the time in the caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;Through it all….none of it …would have been possible without the best fans in the world. You all are RIDERS and you all have made the ride so fun and ICONIC!!</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you madly and appreciate you right back.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ellen Pompeo is pictured here as Meredith Grey during Season 17 of the show Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>ABC has not yet announced whether Grey&#8217;s Anatomy will return in 2023-2024.</p>



<p>A few months ago, Pompeo hinted at a Grey&#8217;s Anatomy evolution as she looked ahead to her future beyond the medical drama.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trying to reinvent the show and continually trying to reinvent the show is the challenge at this point, and listen, the show speaks to a lot of people, and the young people love the show,&#8221; she told Entertainment Tonight in May. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inspired so many generations of healthcare workers.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think for the young people, it&#8217;s a really good piece of content and we&#8217;re going to try to keep it going for the young people, not necessarily with me, but keep it going beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen Pompeo has scrubbed out of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>Perhaps for the final time.</p>



<p>On Thursday afternoon, the veteran actress uploaded the following photo of herself and included with it a message to all fans of the beloved medical drama.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am eternally grateful and humbled by the love and support you have all shown me, Meredith GREY and the show for 19 seasons!&#8221; wrote the star to open this caption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Ellen Pompeo posted this picture on social media as a way to say goodbye to Grey&#8217;s Anatomy fans in late 2022.</figcaption></figure>



<p>She penned it one week after the Grey&#8217;s Anatomy winter finale aired on ABC.</p>



<p>Immediately after this episode, fans were treated to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/greys-anatomy-faces-a-massive-fire-shocking-character-exit/">a preview of what&#8217;s to come on the series</a> &#8212; highlighted by a number of Meredith&#8217;s co-workers toasting her goodbye before the character moves to the east coast.</p>



<p>Prior to Season 19, the network confirmed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/greys-anatomy-shocker-ellen-pompeo-to-barely-appear-on-season-19/">Pompeo would only be appearing in a total of 8 episodes</a> this fall and winter.</p>



<p>The final two of those installments will air in February and early March.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Through it all….none of it …would have been possible without the best fans in the world. You all are RIDERS and you all have made the ride so fun and ICONIC!!&#8221; continued Pompeo on social media.</p>



<p>She concluded as follows:</p>



<p><strong>I love you madly and appreciate you right back. This isn’t your first time on the rollercoaster… you know the show must go on and I’ll definitely be back to visit. </strong></p>



<p><strong>With a lot of love and immense.</strong></p>

ELLEN POMPEO</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pompeo stepped back from the long-running show this season to pursue outside projects&#8230; including Hulu&#8217;s adaptation of the 2009 film Orphan, which follows a terrifying adoption story in which a couple&#8217;s new daughter turns out to be a grown woman masquerading as a child.</p>



<p>She made it clear numerous times in the past that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">anxious for Grey&#8217;s Anatomy to end</a>.</p>



<p>But higher-ups just kept throwing millions of dollars at her!</p>



<p>&#8220;​I feel like I’m the super naive one who keeps saying, ‘But what’s the story going to be, what story are we going to tell?’&#8221; Pompeo said in December 2021. </p>



<p>&#8220;And everyone’s like, ‘Who cares, Ellen? It makes a gazillion dollars.’&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Fun in the snow! Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is pictured here in a scene from Season 18.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meredith&#8217;s storyline appears to have wrapped up with the surgeon&#8217;s decision to leave Seattle for Boston, where she accepted a position with the Catherine Fox Foundation to research Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, unlike many other fictional doctors throughout the history of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, Meredith wasn&#8217;t killed off.</p>



<p>Her new job certainly leaves the door open for guest appearances.</p>



<p>ABC, of course, will likely need to renew Grey&#8217;s Anatomy for another season for this to happen.</p>



<p>Are you listening, executives?!?</p>

<p>As previously reported, Ellen Pompeo will soon be stepping away from Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>The veteran actress, who has anchored this series since its premiere in the role of Meredith Grey, only signed on to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/greys-anatomy-faces-a-massive-fire-shocking-character-exit/">appear in eight episodes this season</a>.</p>



<p>Her final two installments will air in early 2023.</p>



<p>What will she do next? After she scrubs out for the final time?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>According to Radar Online, Pompeo may very well return to television &#8212; alongside her former co-star, Patrick Dempsey.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re both bitter about being phased out of the show,&#8221; an <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/greys-anatomy-patrick-dempsey-ellen-pompeo-new-show/">insider told this website</a> on Thursday.</p>



<p>Dempsey was written off Grey&#8217;s Anatomy in 2015, although his character of Derek Shepherd made a couple of unexpected cameos two years ago.</p>



<p>By various accounts, he was unhappy on set for many months prior to this exit, with one report delving into the alleged ways in which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/patrick-dempsey-terrorized-greys-anatomy-set-gave-co-stars-ptsd/">Dempsey made life awful for those around him</a> at the time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Radar claims that Dempsey is &#8220;still very stung&#8221; these accusations made in 2021 by producer James D. Parriott, who claimed the actor &#8220;terrorized&#8221; the set and battled with show creator Shonda Rhimes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Patrick says Ellen was one of the only ones who had his back — and he&#8217;d love to work with her again, particularly in a new show that would stick it to their old colleagues and kick their butts in ratings,&#8221; the insider added.</p>



<p>As for Pompeo?</p>



<p>&#8220;Ellen&#8217;s totally up for it once she&#8217;s done milking Grey&#8217;s dry,&#8221; the website continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Pompe, for the record, makes $20 million per season of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s admitted for awhile now that she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">anxious for the show to be over</a>&#8230; while also admitting that she can&#8217;t turn down that sort of contract.</p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t sound like someone who&#8217;s bitter at her employer, does it?</p>



<p>Pompeo is the one who chose to cut her Season 19 screen time way down; she certainly isn&#8217;t being forced off the drama.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Fun in the snow! Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is pictured here in a scene from Season 18.</figcaption></figure>



<p>All that said, Pompeo and Dempsey <em>could</em> one day work together again.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve said they want to.</p>



<p>We just don&#8217;t think the basis behind any potential pairing would be revenge against network executives.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done some of our greatest work together,&#8221; Pompeo previously told Extra TV. </p>



<p>&#8220;Both of us are very proud of the work we did. We had a great time doing it, and we created something really iconic&#8230; I think the fans would absolutely love it.&#8221; </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="543" height="379" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/patrick-dempsey-on-greys.jpg" alt="Patrick Dempsey on Grey's" class="wp-image-191972" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/patrick-dempsey-on-greys.jpg 543w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/patrick-dempsey-on-greys-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/patrick-dempsey-on-greys-335x234.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/patrick-dempsey-on-greys-347x242.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/patrick-dempsey-on-greys-520x363.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dempsey has said he feels the same way.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to work with her again,&#8221; he has said, adding in the past:</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always been a really special relationship Ellen and I have had together in front of the screen and behind it as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>The fall finale of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy aired on Thursday night.</p>



<p>The series will not return with new episodes until February 23, which at least gives fans plenty of time to prepare for what they know is coming&#8230; and yet may find very difficult to accept:</p>



<p>The departure of Ellen Pompeo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We learned back in August that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/greys-anatomy-shocker-ellen-pompeo-to-barely-appear-on-season-19/">Pompeo would only return for Season 19</a> in the beloved role of Meredith for a total of eight episodes.</p>



<p>The actress had been candid over recent years that she was pretty much done with acting &#8212; and that she really didn&#8217;t know where else the long-running show could even go.</p>



<p>Heck, Pompeo once admitted that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">anxious for Grey&#8217;s Anatomy to end</a>.</p>



<p>That day may still be far in the future, but the November 10 installment of the medical drama <em>did</em> at least make it clear just how and why Meredith&#8217;s time in Seattle is coming to an end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The surgeon sent a short and sweet email to the staff of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, officially announcing that she was moving to Boston because she had accepted a position with the Catherine Fox Foundation to research Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>



<p>On a professional level, this left Richard wondering how the decision will affect the new intern class.</p>



<p>On a personal level, this left Nick reeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;You took the Boston job without even talking to me, without even thinking of talking to me,&#8221; he told his girlfriend on the episode. </p>



<p>&#8220;And I get it. I do. I get it, your family needs you. But it sucks. It sucks. And I&#8217;m being supportive because there is no other answer.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Later, Maggie went over to Meredith&#8217;s house (formerly her mom&#8217;s house, of course) to help her pack her belongings.</p>



<p>But then, after Meredith left to perform a procedure, lightning struck a tree right near the house.</p>



<p>The mother of three raced home, discovered her children were safe and was then handed the framed Post-It of her original vows with Derek from way back in the day.</p>



<p>&#8220;Winston found this earlier. It fell when the lightning hit. It was all I managed to take,&#8221; Maggie said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="496" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png" alt="Pompeo" class="wp-image-412644" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png 496w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-300x269.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-335x301.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-347x311.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption>Ellen Pompeo is coming back, folks! She has signed for Grey&#8217;s Anatomy Season 19.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking ahead, meanwhile, ABC aired a trailer for the winter premiere of the show&#8230; making it clear that the February 23 episode will focus on Meredith&#8217;s stunning departure.</p>



<p>In the promo, a glowing Meredith walks the halls of Grey Sloan on her final day as she prepares to leave Seattle behind.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a lot,&#8221; Meredith says, as the footage flashes back to the devastating fire that tore through the home she once shared with her late husband, Derek. &#8220;A fire. Moving.&#8221;</p>



<p>Naturally, however, Meredith then gets a send-off worthy of her legacy, despite her labeling of the hospital party as &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Fun in the snow! Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is pictured here in a scene from Season 18.</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, Owen, Teddy, Webber, Maggie and others want their friend to have her moment to shine. </p>



<p>&#8220;For god&#8217;s sakes Grey, will you just let us toast you?&#8221; Owen says, offering her a glass of champagne.</p>



<p>As stated previously, Pompeo appears in eight episodes this season, and the winter premiere will mark her seventh episode..</p>



<p>This means the actress and executive producer will return to Grey&#8217;s at least one more time before season 19 is over.</p>

<p>We have an update on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy Season 19.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s a doozy.</p>



<p>According to an exclusive Deadline story on Wednesday morning, Ellen Pompeo <em>will</em>, indeed, appear on upcoming new episodes of the smash hit medical drama.</p>



<p>But only a handful of them.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-454474" width="840" height="569" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg 921w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-768x520.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-735x498.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-335x227.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-347x235.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-520x352.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-640x434.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>To close out Season 18, Pompeo&#8217;s Meredith Grey&#8217;s chose NOT to relocate to Minnesota. </p>



<p>She decided to stick around Grey Sloan Memorial as an interim Chief of Surgery, which is the role viewers will find her in on the October 7 premiere.</p>



<p>HOWEVER, <strong><a href="https://deadline.com/2022/08/ellen-pompeo-reduce-greys-anatomy-meredith-grey-season-19-episode-count-hulu-series-1235084085/">Pompeo will only appear</a> in eight episodes of the upcoming season</strong>&#8230; although the characte will continue to narrate every episode and the star will continue to serve as an executive producer on the series.</p>



<p>Wow, huh?!?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="496" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png" alt="Pompeo" class="wp-image-412644" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png 496w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-300x269.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-335x301.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-347x311.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pompeo signed a new contract back in January, aware at the time that her role on Season 19 would be significantly scaled back.</p>



<p>This news comes in the wake of Pompeo signing on for her first role other than Meredith Grey in almost two decades:</p>



<p>She&#8217;s set to star in Hulu’s Orphan limited series &#8230; which is inspired by the true story of Ukranian-born Natalia Grace and her American adoptive parents who claimed that she was an adult “sociopath” pretending to be a child.</p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">Pompeo had said she was dying for Grey&#8217;s Anatomy to end</a>; and that she doesn&#8217;t see herself acting very much once the show does eventually wrap up.</p>

<p>Pompeo has been candid for years after how ready she is to leave Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>Responding to a question from Entertainment Tonight in May about whether the series could live on without her, she replied:</p>



<p> “We’ll see.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trying to reinvent the show and continually trying to reinvent the show is the challenge at this point, and listen, the show speaks to a lot of people, and the young people love the show. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s inspired so many generations of healthcare workers, so, I think for for the young people, it’s a really good piece of content and we’re going to try to keep it going for the young people, not necessarily with me, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/greys-anatomy-could-it-continue-without-ellen-pompeo/">but keep it going beyond me</a>.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The show, meanwhile, has hired <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/greys-anatomy-season-19-whats-behind-ultimate-cast-shake-up/">a slew of new series regulars ahead of Season 19</a>.</p>



<p>Adelaide Kane, Harry Shum Jr., Niko Terho, Midori Francis and Alexis Floyd have all signed on as first-year surgical residents.</p>



<p>Deadline, meanwhile, emphasizes that no decision has been made about the show&#8217;s future after Season 19.</p>



<p>But it seems VERY hard to imagine Pompeo will be around for any episodes beyond May 2023.</p>

<p>In January, ABC announced the network had ordered a 19th season of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, which has become the longest-running primetime medical drama series in history.</p>



<p>&#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy has a global impact that can&#8217;t be overstated,&#8221; executive producer and showrunner Krista Vernoff said at the time. &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Grey&#8217;s touches, and sometimes changes, hearts and minds worldwide through the depth of connection people feel with these characters. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to work with our extraordinary writers to dream up where we go from here, and I&#8217;m always grateful to our partners at Disney and ABC for letting us tell bold stories with real impact.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Jesse Williams has the answer to a question we posed just a couple weeks ago.</p>



<p>Based on recent comments made by Ellen Pompeo, it was a topic of conversation last month to wonder <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/greys-anatomy-could-it-continue-without-ellen-pompeo/">whether Grey&#8217;s Anatomy could continue</a> without its leading lady.</p>



<p>If Pompeo ever decided to leave the ABC drama, would the show get canceled along with her exit?</p>



<p>Or would Shonda Rhimes and company find a way to push through, as they did after the departures of such previous main cast members as Patrick Dempsey and T.R. Knight?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Heck, and Jesse Williams, too!</p>



<p>Williams joined Grey&#8217;s Anatomy in Season 6 as Dr. Jackson Avery and exited in 2021 after 12 seasons, although he recently returned for the season 18 finale.</p>



<p>He was nominated this year for a Tony Award and was asked by Access Hollywood in anticipation of that ceremony whether he could foresee a future for aforementioned series &#8230; without Pompeo.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, it would be a different show,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;She&#8217;s the heart of that show. She&#8217;s Grey. So, unlikely.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Jesse Williams is no longer a cast member on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy. We sure do miss that face.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Added Williams, clarifying his stance: &#8220;But again, I don&#8217;t work there anymore. So it doesn&#8217;t matter what I think.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pompeo, of course, has been front and center on this beloved medical drama since its premiere in 2005. </p>



<p>Recently, however, she offered a cryptic response when speaking about the program potentially continuing without her in the lead role of Meredith Grey.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; she said simply.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="496" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png" alt="Pompeo" class="wp-image-412644" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png 496w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-300x269.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-335x301.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-347x311.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking at the time to Entertainment Tonight, she continued as follows: </p>



<p>&#8220;Trying to reinvent the show and continually trying to reinvent the show is the challenge at this point, and listen, the show speaks to a lot of people, and the young people love the show.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inspired so many generations of healthcare workers. </p>



<p>&#8220;So, I think for the young people, it&#8217;s a really good piece of content and we&#8217;re going to try to keep it going for the young people — not necessarily with me, but keep it going beyond me.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Fun in the snow! Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is pictured here in a scene from Season 18.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pompeo has never been shy about her lack of enthusiasm for starring on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy after all these years.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s come right out and said she wants the show to wrap up at some point soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been trying to focus on convincing everybody that it should end,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">Pompeo told Insider</a> while promoting her company Betr Remedies this spring.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like I’m the super naive one who keeps saying, &#8216;But what’s the story going to be, what story are we going to tell?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;And everyone’s like, Who cares, Ellen? It makes a gazillion dollars.'&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo in the Hospital" class="wp-image-409846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-735x679.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-335x310.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-347x321.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-520x481.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-640x592.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Points for honesty, huh?</p>



<p>Pompeo signed a massive contract in 2019 that pays her $20 million per season.</p>



<p>She said in September 2021 that Grey&#8217;s Anatomy will likely mark her final time in front of the camera, as she hopes to focus on directing and producing down the line.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been trying to get away for years. I have been trying,&#8221; she told Entertainment Tonight a few months ago. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s not because I haven’t been trying.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have strong relationships at the network and they have been very, very good to me, and have incentivized me to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>In January, ABC <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/greys-anatomy-renewed-for-season-19/">renewed Grey&#8217;s Anatomy for Season 19</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I couldn’t be more excited that we get to keep telling the stories of Meredith, Bailey, Richard and all of the other doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial for another season,&#8221; creator Shonda Rhimes said in a statement at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a true testament to Krista Vernoff, the cast, the crew and all the writers who keep the audience on the edge of their seat week after week.</p>



<p>&#8220;And it would not be possible without the generations of incredible fans who have supported Grey’s Anatomy for so many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a show that has survived a number of backstage scandals, along with the departures of numerous original cast members &#8212; including Patrick Dempsey, who <a href="/2021/09/patrick-dempsey-terrorized-greys-anatomy-set-gave-co-stars-ptsd/">allegedly terrorized the set</a> toward the end of his run as Derek Shepherd.</p>
<p>And yet: Grey&#8217;s Anatomy remains on the air, and it remains a strong performer for ABC on Thursday nights, as well.</p>
<p>Heck, it just celebrated its 400th episode on the air!</p>
<p>What does the future hold, however?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="496" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png" alt="Pompeo" class="wp-image-412644" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo.png 496w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-300x269.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-335x301.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/pompeo-347x311.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p><a href="/2021/12/ellen-pompeo-im-dying-for-greys-anatomy-to-be-over/">Pompeo has openly said she&#8217;s anxious</a> to move on from both the series and even acting in general &#8212; but that the money keeps pulling her back in.</p>
<p>Speaking to Entertainment Tonight this week, however, Pompeo hinted that she really might be done with Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8230; but that the show could possibly go on without her.</p>
<p>&quot;Shonda and I, I think &#8212; we&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see,&quot; <a href="https://www.etonline.com/ellen-pompeo-on-whether-or-not-she-can-see-greys-anatomy-continuing-without-her-exclusive-184551">Pompeo told ET</a>, referring to creator and close friend Shonda Rhimes.</p>

<p>Pompeo went on to cite the impact Grey&#8217;s Anatomy has had beyond the average television viewer, especially in the wake of how it tackled COVID-19 last season.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s inspired so many generations of healthcare workers, so, I think for for the young people, it&#8217;s a really good piece of content and we&#8217;re going to try to keep it going for the young people,&quot; the star said, before offering up the following bombshell:</p>
<p>&quot;Not necessarily with me, but keep it going beyond me.&quot;</p>
<p><em><strong>Keep it going beyond me</strong></em>. Can you even imagine a Grey&#8217;s Anatomy without Ellen Pompeo?!?</p>

<p>When asked what the series would even be without her main character, whose A<em>natomy</em> would even be at the center of it, so to speak, Pompeo replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find someone, or maybe, we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As previously cited, Pompeo has been refreshingly candid about her desire to move on from this nearly 20-year long gig.</p>
<p>She signed a deal in 2018 that <a href="/2018/03/ellen-pompeo-lashes-out-how-dare-you-blame-me-for-greys-anatomy/">paid her $20 million</a> per season and then signed a new one to take her through Season 19 &#8212; despite having reservations about the program having any new stories to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m the super naive one who keeps saying, &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s the story going to be, what story are we going to tell?&rsquo;&rdquo; Pompeo told Insider in December 2021, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Who cares, Ellen? It makes a gazillion dollars.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>So honest.</p>

<p>Despite Pompeo&#8217;s sort of hilarious efforts to end the procedural drama, Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy was renewed in January for season 19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited that we get to keep telling the stories of Meredith, Bailey, Richard and all of the other doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial for another season,&rdquo; Rhimes said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a true testament to [showrunner] Krista Vernoff, the cast, the crew and all the writers who keep the audience on the edge of their seat week after week.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rsquo;s season 18 finale airs on ABC Thursday, May 26, at 8/7c.</strong></p>
