<p>Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag are many things, but they were also two of the most infamous yet iconic participants in the revival &#8212; and the original show.</p>
<p>Now, they have some exciting news.</p>
<p>Heidi and Spencer are expecting their second child.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Heidi Montag spoke to <a href="https://people.com/parents/heidi-montag-pregnant-expecting-baby-with-spencer-pratt/"><em>People</em></a> on Wednesday, June 1 to confirm that she is pregnant.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old reality star and her husband, 38-year-old Spencer Pratt, are already parents.</p>
<p>Their son, Gunner Stone, was born four years ago.</p>

<p>It is no secret that Heidi and Spencer have been hoping to expand their family.</p>
<p>In fact, she has opened up about their journey to conceive Baby #2.</p>
<p>Their efforts were not immediately successful, leading Heidi to at times wonder if Gunner would be an only child.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I have been trying to get pregnant for over a year and a half, I&#8217;m willing to try different things,&quot; Heidi previously shared.</p>
<p>One of those things was eating, and we wish that we were making this up for a two-months-late April Fools Day post, the heart of a bison.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a great source of nutrients!&quot; Heidi gushed. &quot;I have felt incredible on this diet.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="400" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/spencer-pratt-shrugs-while-heidi-montag-beams.gif" alt="Spencer Pratt Shrugs While Heidi Montag Beams" class="wp-image-18982"><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;A lot more energy, clarity, increased libido, and overall improvement on chronic pain I have had,&quot; Heidi raved.</p>
<p>&quot;Also now I&#8217;ve been taking the supplements called &#8216;Her Package&#8217; from Heart and Soil that has improved my menstrual cycle,&quot; she claimed.</p>
<p>In January, she also opened up more directly with fans about the efforts to conceive.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I never thought it would be so hard trying to have another,&quot; Heidi admtited to her Instagram followers.</p>
<p>&quot;I am trusting God&#8217;s plan,&quot; she affirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;And if we only have one,&quot; Heidi shared, &quot;I am so thankful for this miracle!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It is not exactly a surprise to hear that Heidi down was spotted chowing down on bison heart, and not because it&#8217;s a common tool for conception.</p>
<p>She and Spencer are known .. dare we say, notorious &#8230; for pursuing alternative means of achieving their goals.</p>
<p>Crystals. We&#8217;re talking about crystals.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>More than a decade ago, the two spent some of the last of their initial reality TV fortune on massive, expensive crystals that were meant to bring them wealth.</p>
<p>Obviously, they have both grown and matured a great deal since then.</p>
<p>Burning through an 8-digit fortune is a wakeup call if we&#8217;ve ever heard of one, and fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like they broke the bank on bovine organs.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="280" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/06/you-know-what-you-did.gif" alt="You Know What You Did" class="wp-image-14488"><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Speaking of crystals, however, many could not help but notice Gunner&#8217;s middle name when he was born.</p>
<p>Gunner Stone. It&#8217;s actually kind of subtle.</p>
<p>Hey, they could have been more on the nose about it and named him <em>Jim Stone</em>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>What&#8217;s Baby #2&#8217;s future name? Several people have joked that it will be &quot;Crystal,&quot; but we&#8217;re not sure.</p>
<p>Looking at Heidi&#8217;s unorthodox conception diet, another name comes to mind.</p>
<p>What if Heidi and Spencer name Baby #2 &#8230; Hart? Actually a pretty great name.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last month, MTV <a href="/2022/01/the-hills-new-beginnings-canceled-after-2-seasons/">canceled<em> The Hills: New Beginnings</em></a> after, frankly, a host of issues and some royally bad timing.</p>
<p>Even before the revival ended, Spencer Pratt didn&#8217;t hesitate to put his castmates on blast.</p>
<p>The show ending has not discouraged him from speaking out, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Now, Spencer is calling out a former producer over the infamous Heidi Montag pregnancy hoax from the original reality series.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Spencer Pratt is yet another user of TikTok.</p>
<p>Despite being well beyond the target age demographic for the deservedly controversial app, Spencer has never shied away from clout-chasing.</p>
<p>On a recent video, he narrated over season two&#8217;s plot &#8230; alleging that it was basically all reality TV fakery.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Spencer accused the show of being staged &#8230; and then went after producer Adam DiVello.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it&#8217;s shady some old men asked young girl to fake this,&quot; he said of the faux pregnancy in his video on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Adam DiVello the producer is as creepy as creepy gets,&quot; Spencer accused.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As viewers may recall, Heidi was shown reluctantly going to the bathroom, where she opened a pregnancy test.</p>
<p>Visibly anxious, she looked back and forth between the test and the mirror.</p>
<p>Heidi closed the door, giving herself privacy from the cameras. The implication was that she had taken the test.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;That was all set up,&quot; Spencer claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;We got these 40-year-old plus men asking a 20-year-old &#8212; maybe 21-year-old &#8212; woman,&quot; he accused.</p>
<p>Spencer said that they asked her &quot;to go pretend like she thinks she&#8217;s pregnant with a guy that&#8217;s already making her look bad.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="400" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/spencer-pratt-shrugs-while-heidi-montag-beams.gif" alt="Spencer Pratt Shrugs While Heidi Montag Beams" class="wp-image-18982"><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;m furious about this,&quot; Spencer declared.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#8217;t believe they played her out like that,&quot; he expressed.</p>
<p>Heidi chimed in, backing up her husband of 14 years by participating in the same TikTok video.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;They were like, &#8216;OK, we have a really great idea for you,&#8217;&quot; Heidi recalled.</p>
<p>She described it &quot;like they just gave me the lead role in Twilight or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And guess what, I was excited to get more screen time,&quot; Heidi noted, &quot;so I was like, &#8216;Whatever, sure. Who cares.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-1024x585.png" alt="Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, and Brody Jenner Are Back!" class="wp-image-333031" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-1024x585.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-300x171.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-768x439.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-735x420.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-335x191.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-347x198.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-520x297.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-640x366.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-960x549.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back-1080x617.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-and-brody-jenner-are-back.png 1400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Adam DiVello does not appear to have addressed any of this in any public forum.</p>
<p>He was an executive producer on <em>The Hills</em> from 2006 to 2008.</p>
<p>These days, DiVello is an EP of <em>Selling Sunset</em>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Spencer really seems to have a beef with DiVello in particular.</p>
<p>Just days before this video, he had yet another video highlighting that throwback.</p>
<p>&quot;This is so shady,&quot; Spencer accused.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;The thing about this is that it was all staged,&quot; Spencer claimed. &quot;Heidi didn&#8217;t think she was pregnant.&quot;</p>
<p>He commented: &quot;I&#8217;m smiling because I&#8217;m watching her acting abilities.&quot;</p>
<p>According to him, his now-wife had been instructed to act like she had either missed birth control or simply been &quot;reckless out in Hollywood.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s creepy to me,&quot; Spencer expressed.</p>
<p>One supposes so, though we of course remember that production was doing its job, and that Heidi was an adult at the time.</p>
<p>To many who are long-time viewers of reality television, the larger issue may be the fabrication of a storyline rather than the nature of it. Not so for Spencer.</p>

<p>His castmates know it &#8212; including former castmate Lauren Conrad.</p>
<p>Heidi Montag says that Lauren once threatened to have her booted from the series if she didn&#8217;t dump Spencer.</p>
<p>She also says that Lauren treated her like a &quot;dog&quot; &#8230; and could have been a makeup mogul like Kylie Jenner.</p>

<p>This week, Heidi Montag was a guest on Alexandra Cooper&#8217;s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/42ZrP6vWE19UtRD6OcWhNT"><em>Call Her Daddy</em></a> podcast.</p>
<p>Alexandra had praised Lauren for opting out of the ongoing &quot;scramble&quot; for fame.</p>
<p>Heidi shared that she has a slightly different take on her former castmate.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I feel like Kristin, let&#8217;s be honest, is the most successful,&quot; Heidi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like Lauren didn&#8217;t make it like she should have,&quot; she opined.</p>
<p>Heidi added: &quot;She should be Kylie [Jenner].&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was so good at makeup,&quot; Heidi explained, seemingly praising her friend.</p>
<p>Still speaking of Lauren, she added that &quot;she should have done the tutorials.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she had a good team, she&#8217;d be a billionaire,&quot; Heidi estimated before revising: &quot;She&#8217;d be a hundred-millionaire.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="280" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/06/you-know-what-you-did.gif" alt="You Know What You Did" class="wp-image-14488"><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;She is not where she should have been at all,&quot; Heidi opined.</p>
<p>&quot;She has a Kohl&#8217;s line,&quot; she acknowledged dismissively. &quot;Great, whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But she should be a hundred-millionaire,&quot; Heidi insisted, &quot;are you kidding me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who gets that big promotion, that big fame,&quot; Heidi began.</p>
<p>&quot;That big engine behind her, the loved one, the this-and-that,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;The narrator,&quot; Heidi continued. &quot;No one even gets the narrator show.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kylie didn&#8217;t get a narrator show,&quot; Heidi pointed out.</p>
<p>Describing Lauren, Heidi added: &quot;She should be so rich.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of a backhanded compliment to say that someone could be mega-wealthy but totally threw away their chance at it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-644x1024.jpg" alt="Lauren Conrad Heidi Montag 2006 VMAs" class="wp-image-238258" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-644x1024.jpg 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-189x300.jpg 189w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-768x1220.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-967x1536.jpg 967w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-1289x2048.jpg 1289w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-735x1168.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-211x335.jpg 211w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-218x347.jpg 218w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-327x520.jpg 327w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-403x640.jpg 403w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-483x768.jpg 483w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-604x960.jpg 604w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-680x1080.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-heidi-montag-2006-vmas-scaled.jpg 1611w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Bryan Bedder/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Still, Heidi insisted that she will &quot;always love&quot; Lauren.</p>
<p>She still credits her for giving her a start in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>But Heidi recalls how her husband, Spencer Pratt, was viewed and treated by Lauren early in their relationship.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="400" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/spencer-pratt-shrugs-while-heidi-montag-beams.gif" alt="Spencer Pratt Shrugs While Heidi Montag Beams" class="wp-image-18982"><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;When that whole Spencer thing happened,&quot; Heidi recalled.</p>
<p>She accused Lauren of demanding that she drop her now-husband.</p>
<p>According to Heidi: &quot;she&#8217;s like, &#8216;If you date Spencer, you&#8217;re off the show.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you,&quot; Heidi responded, her indignation just as palpable all of these years later.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she continued, &quot;I&#8217;m not your dog.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, her gratitude for what Lauren did for her only went so far.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="265" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/lauren-conrad-sucky-person-gif.gif" alt="Lauren Conrad: Sucky Person GIF" class="wp-image-235468"><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I appreciate you getting me on this show,&quot; Heidi characterized her reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;But that doesn&#8217;t mean you own me,&quot; she noted, &quot;and you can tell me what to do in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Heidi expressed: &quot;I just don&#8217;t appreciate that.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I do have such a love for Lauren,&quot; Heidi then claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she added, &quot;it didn&#8217;t have to go that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She chose and wanted it to go that way,&quot; Heidi accused.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;And then kept following up with that,&quot; Heidi said.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she went on, &quot;then kept blaming things on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Heidi added that Lauren was resentful of her &quot;and blaming her sex tape on me.&quot;</p>

<p>To hear Heidi tell it, she fully expects to start trying to get pregnant as soon as possible. The clock is ticking, folks!</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 25, Heidi Montag was in attendance at the Booby Tape USA Launch Party.</p>
<p>There, she revealed to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/heidi-montag-spencer-pratts-plans-for-baby-no-2/"><em>Us Weekly</em></a> that she and Spencer are already making plans to expand their family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that they want a second child.</p>
<p>They apparently have a timeframe in mind for when they would like to start trying to conceive.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully in a few months,&quot; Heidi reveals. &quot;We&rsquo;ll start trying&quot;</p>

<p>Heidi also gushed about little Gunner Stone, who will be two years old in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s starting to talk a lot more, which is really fun,&rdquo; Heidi reveals.</p>
<p>Different babies develop linguistic skills at different ages and rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loves TV,&quot; Heidi notes. &quot;Which is great for traveling and he&rsquo;s running the sprints everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>She brags: &quot;[He&rsquo;s] just a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to some concerns about screen time and child development, TV in moderation can be wonderfully stimulating for children.</p>

<p>It sounds like Gunner really does take after his parents &#8212; and especially hi dad.</p>
<p>The adorable baby also &ldquo;loves [playing with] crystals.&quot;</p>
<p>Heidi also shares that he enjoys being in the presence of the <em>The Hills: New Beginnings</em> camera crew.</p>
<p>&quot;He loves an audience,&quot; she explains.</p>
<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s a great artist, actually,&quot; Heidi brags. &quot;He loves painting, and he&rsquo;s really great at the piano.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Spencer spoke just last month about what Heidi is like as a mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Heidi was a very, very intense-attachment parent,&rdquo; Spencer shared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure some would say extreme,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But to me it was just being a super mom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be honest, if it [wasn&rsquo;t] for&nbsp;<em>The Hills</em>, I don&rsquo;t know if she would have ever left Gunner&rsquo;s side,&quot; Spencer confessed.</p>
<p>It turns out that Heidi wonders the same thing.</p>

<p>This week, Heidi also acknowledged that the show &quot;was actually a blessing in disguise.&quot;</p>
<p>Or just a blessing. They&#8217;re getting money and reality stardom again. How many people get a second chance like that?</p>
<p>&quot;It was nice because I wouldn&rsquo;t have left [Gunner],&quot; she admitted. &quot;And I kind of needed a little encouragement and motivation to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s still really hard for me to leave him,&quot; Heidi shared.</p>
<p>Obviously, the most fun for me is being home and being with my son and I love being a mom,,&quot; Heidi emphasized.</p>
<p>&quot;[But] at the same time, it&rsquo;s good for both of us to go out sometimes,&quot; she points out very correctly.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Honestly, hearing that Gunner likes crystals is almost too funny.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising &#8212; most humans like them &#8212; but for Spencer, they were once a financially devastating addiction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see these two with their lives more or less in order.</p>
<p>We wish them the best of luck in giving Gunner a younger sibling!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re just days away from the debut of&nbsp;<em>The Hills: New Beginnings</em>, and the drama is already starting to boil over.</p>
<p>Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag will be among the familiar faces, and Pratt&#8217;s own sister, returning star Stephanie Pratt is already&nbsp;<a href="/2019/04/stephanie-pratt-slams-brother-spencer-and-heidi-montag-they-are/">putting the couple on blast</a>.</p>
<p>In a brand new teaser interview for&nbsp;<em>The Hills</em>&#8216; hotly anticipated reboot, Spencer and Heidi respond to Stephanie&#8217;s aspersions, and promise More Drama is on the way!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-683x1024.jpg" alt="Speidi at the MTV Movie and TV Awards" class="wp-image-331680" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/speidi-at-the-mtv-movie-and-tv-awards-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Speidi showed up to&nbsp;<em>The Hills: New Beginnings&nbsp;</em>premier&nbsp;event on Wednesday, where they were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1051110/spencer-pratt-reveals-his-hills-hit-list-teases-crazy-cast-drama">interviewed</a>&nbsp;by E! News&#8217; Justin Sylvester.</p>
<p>Justin begins the interview by asking what the couple has been up to, and if the nine years since&nbsp;<em>The Hills</em>&nbsp;ended had been difficult for them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great question since, as Stephanie&#8217;s podcast reminds us, the couple has been through some trying times in recent years.</p>
<p>But Heidi is quick to downplay that drama, saying that their hardest years were actually caught on camera during the original run of&nbsp;<em>The Hills</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a really challenging time in our relationship, when our friends were trying to tear us apart,&quot; Heidi explains.</p>
<p>According to Heidi, after&nbsp;<em>The Hills</em>, the couple finally got to relax and enjoy life, while Spencer attended USC to get his political science degree.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="400" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/spencer-pratt-shrugs-while-heidi-montag-beams.gif" alt="Spencer Pratt Shrugs While Heidi Montag Beams" class="wp-image-18982"><figcaption>(Entertainment Tonight)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Next, Justin shifts the focus to Spencer, and his history of being vindictive on the show.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like you can hold a grudge,&quot; the host suggests.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, my burn diary is out,&quot; Spencer admits, adding that he has a &quot;hit list&quot; of people he still has beef with.</p>
<p>Spencer even jokingly spoils the title of the first episode, &quot;I Don&#8217;t Hold Grudges&#8230; JK!!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope he&#8217;s kidding, because that&#8217;s a terrible title. But it&#8217;s crystal clear that Spencer still relishes the conflict he&#8217;s known for &#8212; and the screen time that goes with it!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Justin went on to ask Spencer who was the first name on his &quot;hit list&quot; going into the new season.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone. No one was safe,&quot; Spencer replies, looking very pleased with himself.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, some of that grudge must be aimed at his sister Stephanie, who will be returning to star in the reboot as well.</p>
<p>But when pressed on the issue, Spencer suddenly becomes quite diplomatic.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no beef with any family member,&quot; he assures Justin, adding that &quot;It&#8217;s totally one-sided.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Of course, just because the beef is one-sided doesn&#8217;t mean Spencer doesn&#8217;t deserve Stephanie&#8217;s ire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spencer definitely did a lot of the awful things his sister is mad about, but probably just doesn&#8217;t care enough to feel any kind of way about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He certainly doesn&#8217;t address any of their specific issues in the interview, saying it all took place off camera.</p>
<p>But when asked if Stephanie was just making the fight up to generate more interest in the series, he simply said &quot;I think Stephanie is a great asset to the show.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a suspiciously coy response, coming from someone who&#8217;s usually embarrassingly forthcoming.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Spencer puts his foot in his mouth just a moment later in fact, after unwittingly accusing co-star Brody Jenner of cheating on his wife!</p>
<p>While hijacking a question clearly posed to Heidi, Spencer proclaims that Brandon Lee is sure to be the new breakout star of the show.</p>
<p>Heidi agrees he&#8217;s quite the heartbreaker, calling Brandon the &quot;evolution&quot; of Brody&#8217;s portrayal on the original series.</p>
<p>But then Justin asks which of the two celebs had more game with the ladies.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Brody Jenner is still the biggest mack on&nbsp;<em>The Hills,&quot;&nbsp;</em>Spencer replies, definitively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;You think Brody Jenner is pulling more girls than Brandon Lee,&quot; the interviewer follows up incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Currently,&quot; Spencer responds.</p>
<p>What follows is a beautiful, stunned moment of silence as Justin looks at the camera and Spencer slowly realises what he&#8217;s said.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, oh wait, he&#8217;s married. Never mind!&quot; Spencer hastily corrects himself.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Not wanting to touch that, Justin shifts the focus back to Heidi, who tries to smooth over her husband&#8217;s problematic candor.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#8217;t want the truth out there, you should be scared,&quot; she concludes, much to Spencer&#8217;s delight.</p>
<p>We definitely want the truth out there!&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The interview wound down with a look ahead for Speidi&#8217;s role this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can expect Heidi&#8217;s arc to deal with being a mom and facing her seperation anxiety from her one-year-old son, who is seriously named Gunner.</p>
<p>The season will also feature Spencer running his healing crystal jewely business,&nbsp;<a href="https://prattdaddycrystals.com/">Pratt Daddy Crystals</a>. Yikes.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>New Beginnings</em>&nbsp;is as awkward and high-energy as this interview was, we have a lot to look forward to when the series debuts next week.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, not long after Spencer Pratt and company came together on the red carpet of the <a href="/2018/08/mtv-video-music-awards-and-the-winners-were/">MTV Video Music Awards</a> for a reunion photo, MTV made the announcement many had been waiting to hear for months:</p>
<p>THE HILLS IS COMING BACK!</p>
<p>As you can see above,&nbsp;Spencer and Heidi Pratt, Audrina Patridge, Jason Wahler, Justin Bobby, Stephanie Pratt and Frankie Delgado all showed up for the annual awards ceremony, causing some fans to think this mere red carpet gathering would be the only reunion they&#8217;d see for awhile.</p>
<p>But they were sorely (and awesomely?) mistaken.</p>

<p>Midway through the VMAs, MTV ran the promo featured here.</p>
<p>It teased a revival of the former reality series that will apparently be titled <em>The Hills: New Beginnings</em>.</p>
<p>And why not, we guess, right?!?</p>
<p>Last Man Standing is coming back this fall. So is Murphy Brown.</p>
<p>Netflix has found success with Fuller House and MTV itself has found enormous success with Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.</p>
<p>So &#8230; why not The Hills?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to a network press release, this new version of The Hills will reunite original cast members, alongside their kids, friends and returning favorites, while following their personal and professional lives while living in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It is scheduled to premiere in 2019.</p>
<p>In the first preview for the program, footage of Los Angeles plays as Stephanie is heard saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all growing up. It&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really weird. That&#8217;s sort of just how life works.</p>
<p>But <a href="/2017/10/spencer-pratt-and-heidi-montag-welcome-first-child/">Heidi and Spencer have a son</a> now and that <em>is</em> really weird!</p>

<p>Only one question now remains: Will Lauren Conrad appear on the reboot?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound that way.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think I would do another show that involved my family,&rdquo; Conrad told HuffPost earlier this year, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent a lot of years on a show focused on my personal life, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d do it again.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh well. We&#8217;re still all in on a The Hills reboot. How about you?!?</p>
