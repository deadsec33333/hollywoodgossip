<p>“Next year, when you all see me, you won’t recognize me,” he told fans in a moving <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jellyroll615/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> video. </p>



<p>“I am going to get under a pile of weights in a way that I never have.&#8221;</p>



<p>The news comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jelly-roll-quits-twitter-because-its-just-too-darn-toxic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jelly Roll&#8217;s decision to quit Twitter</a> due to the site&#8217;s issues with trolls and harassment. </p>



<p>His wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jelly-roll-divorce-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bunnie XO</a>, spoke on the matter and revealed that her husband was frequently bullied over his weight.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s video prominently features Jelly Roll&#8217;s nutrition coach, Ian Larios, who revealed some of the secrets behind the musician&#8217;s transformation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jelly-roll-s-new-routine">Jelly Roll&#8217;s New Routine</h2>



<p>Jelly Roll has made some major changes to his tour routine, cutting way back on the partying and doubling down on exercise and plant-based meals.</p>



<p>Larios revealed that Jelly Roll typically snacks on bananas before hitting the stage.</p>



<p>For larger meals, he still enjoys his favorites, like Nashville hot chicken — but with a healthier preparation. Larios explains that he removes the breading and air fries the chicken, thus “taking away the oil and the batter from it.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jelly Roll attends the 2024 Country Music Television (CMT) Awards at the Moody Center in Austin, Texas, on April 7, 2024." class="wp-image-511774" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2139242629-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll attends the 2024 Country Music Television (CMT) Awards at the Moody Center in Austin, Texas, on April 7, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>He also serves air-fried French fries that have been boiled in bone broth, which “ups the protein in it, but it also makes it have that nice crunch to it.”</p>



<p>“So it tricks your brain into thinking that this is, like, that nice greasy Nashville deep-fried hot chicken. He’s gonna feel like he’s eating at home,” Larios added.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-jelly-roll">What&#8217;s Next For Jelly Roll?</h2>



<p>Jelly Roll is only halfway through his current tour, which will keep him busy through November. And he just dropped <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/how-many-grammys-does-jelly-roll-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his tenth studio album</a>, <em>Beautifully Broken</em>, earlier this month.</p>



<p>Thus far, the project has exceeded expectations, in terms of both reviews and sales.</p>



<p>As for what the next big step in Jelly Roll&#8217;s career might look like &#8230; well, that&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>



<p>Fans want <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jelly-roll-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jelly Roll to replace Katy Perry on <em>American Idol</em></a>. But that would likely require him to take a break from touring and recording.</p>



<p>And it seems like he&#8217;s having too much fun as one of the world&#8217;s biggest singer-songwriters to go on hiatus. </p>

<p>Jelly Roll is removing himself from the social media narrative.</p>



<p>The 39-year-old singer announced on his former Twitter account this weekend that he would be leaving the platform after witnessing simply cruel and awful discourse across his timeline.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to argue the guy doesn&#8217;t have a point there.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511537" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152736376-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll arrives for the 59th Academy of Country Music awards (ACM) at Ford Center in The Star in Frisco, Texas, May 16, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO / AFP) (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is for sure the most toxic negative app to exist ever — PERIOD. Lol,” Jelly Roll wrote October 20. </p>



<p>“This place is different man, I always heard it was the Wild West on here but man it’s insane. It’s a safe place for everyone to say mean s&#8211;t to each other with no consequences. I’m out lol.”</p>



<p>Just prior to the star&#8217;s announcement, he had been posting photos from his appearance at the 2024 Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony&#8230; where he performed “Mama, I’m Coming Home” as a part of his Ozzy Osbourne tribute.</p>



<p>After uploading a backstage photo with his band and Jack Black &#8212; along with the caption, “This is crazy&#8221; &#8212; one user replied as follows: </p>



<p>“Jack Black looking real uncomfortable.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511538" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2150980980-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll performs on stage during the iHeartCountry Festival at Moody Center in Austin, Texas, on May 4, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This might not come across as an especially disdainful remark, but it did highlight the idea that total strangers feel a need to comment on basically anything via social media.</p>



<p>And those comments are pretty much always negative.</p>



<p>“Jack Black hung out with us for 10 hours in the green room,” Jelly Roll responded. “Coolest most comfortable dude I’ve ever met in my life lol.”</p>



<p>The rapper&#8217;s decision came mere days after an October 18 Tweet of his gained attention when he wrote:</p>



<p>“Learned a lot about how slimy the music business is this week, don’t worry yall know I’m going to expose it soon. This whole thing is smoke and mirrors yall. All that s&#8211;t Russ be talking about is REAL!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-688x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511539" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-688x1024.jpg 688w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-202x300.jpg 202w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-768x1143.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-645x960.jpg 645w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-726x1080.jpg 726w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-807x1200.jpg 807w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2161339404-scaled.jpg 1721w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll arrives for the 37th annual Nickelodeon Kids&#8217; Choice Awards at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, July 13, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Etienne LAURENT / AFP)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain to just whom or what Jelly Roll was referring in that message.</p>



<p>And now we may never know.</p>



<p>For the record, Jelly Roll’s Instagram account is still active &#8212; with the singer having garnered 3.4 million followers on that website.</p>



<p>He previously took a social media hiatus this spring, as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;My husband got off the Internet because he is so tired of being bullied about his f&#8211;king weight,&#8221; Jelly Roll’s wife, Bunnie XO, said in an April 22 TikTok promoting her April 24 episode of her podcast. &#8220;That makes me want to cry because he is the sweetest angel baby&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t show it to you guys but I&#8217;m gonna have a very vulnerable moment here.</p>



<p>&#8220;It hurts him. The Internet can say whatever the f-ck they want about you and they say ‘well you&#8217;re a celebrity, you&#8217;re supposed to be able to handle it,&#8217;—no the f-ck you&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Jelly Roll be replacing Katy Perry on <em>American Idol</em>?</p>



<p>A lot of fans would like to see it happen. Especially after his stint as a guest mentor.</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/katy-perry-pregnant-baby-number-2-american-idol-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Perry is quitting <em>American Idol</em></a>, who will fill her role as judge?</p>



<p>Jelly Roll&#8217;s name is on the lips of many viewers. But he&#8217;s not the only candidate to fill the pop star&#8217;s shoes.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jelly Roll in April of 2024." class="wp-image-497472" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll, winner of CMT Performance of the Year, Male Video of The Year and Video of the Year awards poses in the press room during the 2024 CMT Music Awards at Moody Center on April 07, 2024,<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Chris Saucedo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-on-american-idol-jelly-roll-is-making-quite-the-impression">On &#8216;American Idol,&#8217; Jelly Roll is making quite the impression</h2>



<p>During the Monday, April 8 episode of <em>American Idol,</em> the second half of the Top 24 finalists performed. This was just ahead of the talent competition announcing its Top 20.</p>



<p>Jelly Roll, a Country singer whose name evokes hunger, had joined the show as a guest mentor &#8212; and as a performer.</p>



<p>He soon became emotional when 19-year-old Mia Matthews dedicated her song to her late father.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jelly Roll on April 7, 2024." class="wp-image-497473" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_jellyroll_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll accepts the CMT Performance of the Year Award for &#8220;Need a Favor&#8221; onstage during the 2024 CMT Music Awards  at Moody Center on April 07, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hubert Vestil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I lost my father in 2019. So brave of you to pick that song,&#8221; an emotional Jelly Roll declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably the single hardest experience I ever had.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Country singer then joked: &#8220;Thanks for making me cry. I hate you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mia Matthews countered with: &#8220;I love you!&#8221; Jelly Roll then returned the sentiment, this time without joking.</p>

<p>At the moment, it&#8217;s unclear who will replace Katy Perry after she departs from the show. </p>



<p>Though speculation is that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-wedding-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Katy&#8217;s family life</a> is her new priority, there are also exciting whispers about her upcoming music.</p>



<p>Fans are speculating that Jelly Roll might step up to the judge&#8217;s chair. He certainly seems to be a likeable guy, with a sympathetic background and a success story.</p>

<p>Some fans are clamoring to see Jelly Roll fill Katy Perry&#8217;s spot. And it&#8217;s possible that producers invited him as a guest mentor as a sort of trial balloon, to see how audiences respond to him.</p>



<p>Additionally, Jelly Roll himself seemed to imply that he enjoyed his time on the infamous talent show.</p>



<p>On Monday, April 8, he tweeted: &#8220;I could get used to doing this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jordin Sparks famously won Season 6 of <em>American Idol</em>, back in 2007 when the show was truly popular. She was only 17 years old at the time.</p>



<p>In February of 2024, she threw her proverbial hat into the ring. </p>



<p>&#8220;Oh hiiii @AmericanIdol &#8212; I hear a seat opened up at the judges&#8217; table! I’m putting my name in the hat!&#8221; Jordin wrote.</p>

<p>Truth be told, many talent competitions attempt to cycle judges in and out who cover similar demographics. Slipping up can be disastrous. </p>



<p>Fans recently pointed out <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-voice-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how <em>The Voice</em> erred</a> in casting too many Country stars as coaches during the same season. And that is only one example.</p>



<p>Katy Perry is the biggest name in <em>American Idol</em>&#8216;s panel of revival judges. Perhaps production will look for someone more affordable, but doing so could sacrifice the allure of a high-profile star like Perry. Maybe Jelly Roll or Jordin Sparks can fit the show&#8217;s needs &#8230; or maybe not.</p>
