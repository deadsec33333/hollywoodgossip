<p>Kate Gosselin is still on the dating market, an ominous report warns.</p>



<p>Beware!</p>



<p>Despite reported <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/how-much-is-kate-gosselin-worth-broke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial difficulties</a> and the dismal <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/collin-gosselin-abuse-claims-kate-basement-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quality of her character</a>, the infamous reality TV villain still feels deserving of companionship, according to a new report.</p>



<p>However, she isn&#8217;t looking for love in the same way that most might. Kate has very <em>romantic </em>notions of how to find romance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-would-date-kate-gosselin">Who would date Kate Gosselin?</h2>



<p>According to what an inside source <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kate-gosselin-open-to-dating-but-wont-use-apps-to-find-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tells</a> <em>In Touch Weekly</em>, Kate Gosselin is still looking for someone willing to love her.</p>



<p>“She has a couple friends and as far as I know she’s not dating anyone,” the insider dished. </p>



<p>And when it comes to finding a potential partner or even a first date, she doesn&#8217;t want to do it the conventional way.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="753" height="768" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo.png" alt="Kate Gosselin TLC Photo" class="wp-image-412599" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo.png 753w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo-294x300.png 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo-735x750.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo-328x335.png 328w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo-340x347.png 340w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo-510x520.png 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/kate-gosselin-tlc-photo-628x640.png 628w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Gosselin is angry in this screenshot from her erstwhile reality TV career. Anger often appears to be her default state. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“She wants to meet a guy through friends,&#8221; the source explained.</p>



<p>The insider added: &#8220;Or the old-fashioned way, in a supermarket or coffee shop.”</p>



<p>This source then spelled out that the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/collin-gosselin-to-mom-tell-the-truth-and-we-can-talk-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely reviled</a> reality TV personality is &#8220;not about the dating apps&#8221; after &#8220;trying that route and hating it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-didn-t-she-have-plus-date-for-a-hot-minute">Didn&#8217;t she have &#8216;Plus Date&#8217; for a hot minute?</h2>



<p>In 2019, Kate Gosselin for some reason got her own reality show, <em>Kate Plus Date</em>.</p>



<p>Rather than focusing upon her reign of terror over her children (except for Collin, whom she had institutionalized against his will in 2016), <em>Kate Plus Date</em> followed her attempt to find her perfect match.</p>



<p>Obviously, she needed all of the help that she could get. </p>



<p>But not even the relationship and dating experts could help Kate find her forever man.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="760" height="534" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t.jpg" alt="Kate Gosselin Losing Her S--t" class="wp-image-245828" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t.jpg 760w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t-735x516.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t-335x235.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t-347x244.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t-520x365.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/kate-gosselin-losing-her-s-t-640x450.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Gosselin is always one moment away from an epic meltdown, it feels like.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ultimately, <em>Kate Plus 8</em> lasted only six episodes. (Which was, to be blunt, still six episodes too many)</p>



<p>Though she has had public relationships, they have been few and far between.</p>



<p>Perhaps she keeps things private.</p>



<p>Or maybe she is having trouble finding love because people know a little too much about what sort of person she is.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="593" height="609" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/kate-gosselin-sux.jpg" alt="Kate Gosselin Sux" class="wp-image-331166" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/kate-gosselin-sux.jpg 593w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/kate-gosselin-sux-292x300.jpg 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/kate-gosselin-sux-326x335.jpg 326w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/kate-gosselin-sux-338x347.jpg 338w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/kate-gosselin-sux-506x520.jpg 506w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Gosselin is not the most popular celebrity. She may, in fact, be the least popular.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-odds-of-her-making-that-connection">What are the odds of her making that connection?</h2>



<p>Years ago, Kate moved from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. </p>



<p>While NC is home to large cities and world-class hospitals where a registered nurse might find work, she now resides in the small town of Troutman in the Western portion of the state.</p>



<p>With a population under 4,000, she has narrowed her potential dating pool to the approximate size of a high school. </p>



<p>She might need <em>extraordinary </em>good luck to run into &#8220;mister right&#8221; at a coffee shop. </p>



<p>And that might be more good luck than she deserves.</p>

<p>It’s been a hot minute since anyone has heard from Kate Gosselin.</p>



<p>That is, unless you’re her ex-husband.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Gosselin family narrative has been squarely focused on Collin in 2024. Namely, for the first time as an adult, he has come forward to share his full side of the story of his upbringing and how his mother has, in his words, ruined his life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is, aside from Collin and his sister Hannah, both of who have elected to live with their father Jon over their mother Kate, not much has been seen or said from the rest of the family.</p>



<p>Given that Kate was such a public figure for so many years, and worked the reality show circuit so extensively, it’s hard to believe that she’s started to fade from fame.</p>



<p>It may even be harder to believe given that, last we heard, she’s pretty broke and even had to stoop as low as asking her ex for MONEY!</p>



<p>But let’s back up a bit…</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-gosselin-s-money-problems"><strong>Kate Gosselin’s Money Problems</strong></h2>



<p>B.I.G famously said&nbsp; mo’money, mo’problems , but no problems comes with it’s own challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, it was reported that Kate had found herself in a distressed financial situation.</p>



<p>Actually, to be blunt, as previously detailed right here on The Hollywood Gossip,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kate-gosselin-living-all-alone-broke-and-desperate-for-money/"> Gosselin was and perhaps still is practically broke</a>.</p>



<p>Yes, she has a nursing degree, but sources told <em>In Touch Weekly</em> that she&#8217;s made no effort to get back into the healthcare business since striking it big on reality television way back in the day on <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8.</em></p>



<p>That series went off the air in 2017 &#8211; but it was far from the end of her reality show career&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past six-plus years, Gosselin has appeared on such programs as <em>Kate Plus 8, Dancing With the Stars, Celebrity Wife Swap</em> and <em>Kate Plus Date.</em></p>



<p>Most recently, she was eliminated on the first episode of <em>Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test</em>&#8230; which likely means she earned less money than those who advanced farther on this Fox competition.</p>



<p>But still, all of those shows, that still has meant money coming in, but where did it all go?</p>



<p>Well, as any parent will tell you, kids are EXPENSIVE!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asking-jon-for-money"><strong>Asking Jon For Money</strong></h2>



<p><em>In Touch</em> quoted an insider at the time as saying Gosselin was &#8220;desperate&#8221; and had to explore perhaps the last avenue she wanted: her ex husband.</p>



<p>Now, before you throw her a pity party, she may very well be entitled to this cash from Jon.</p>



<p>According to the report, Kate took legal action and tried to get Jon to fork over $132,875 in back child support. The money allegedly owed to her goes all the way back to 2012 &#8212; which, again, does not mean she isn&#8217;t entitled to it.</p>



<p>It just also seems to be an indication that she isn&#8217;t bringing in any sort of salary on her own these days.</p>



<p>“She is relentless and desperate for money so she is now trying to sue,&#8221; The Sun wrote of Kate this fall.</p>



<p>Adds the aforementioned In Touch source:</p>



<p>“As the legal battle continues, she doesn’t know how she’s going to make ends meet.&#8221;</p>

It&#8217;s very sad.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jon-s-not-paying-up"><strong>Jon’s Not Paying Up</strong></h2>



<p>As far as we know, Jon never coughed up what she alleges he owed her. Instead, what’ has played out is two years for their son going public with allegations against Kate.</p>



<p>It started in the summer of 2023 after son<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/collin-gosselin-my-mom-sent-me-away-to-hide-her-abuse/"> Colin accused his mother of abuse</a>.</p>



<p>The young man claimed his mom sent him away to a special needs institution back when he was 13 in order to hide the way she had treated him. This snowballed into further accusations that he was kicked out of bootcamp to join the Army because of his time in the institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sum up, it appears Jon is using this family to ensure a fight over money would make Kate look small in comparison.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-speaks-for-herself">Kate Speaks For Herself</h2>



<p>While she has no addressed the rumors of financial ruin publicly, Colin’s&nbsp; accusationa caused Kate to issue a statement of her own.</p>



<p><strong>I have never wanted to have to do this, but I feel I have been backed into a corner and left with no choice. Although it saddens me to do so, I need to speak out now</strong>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kate-gosselin-breaks-silence-labels-son-as-troubled-young-man-who-needs-help/">Kate said to open a lengthy statement</a> on Instagram at the time.</p>



<p><strong>My son Collin, whom I love with all my heart, has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years.</strong></p>



<p><strong>For the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters and for his own well-being, he was placed in a facility following years of outpatient treatment which proved insufficient for his needs.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The decision to admit him was made by emergency room doctors following one of his many attacks/outbursts — this one involving his use of a weapon.</strong></p>



<p>Jon Gosselin rescued Collin from this facility in 2017 and was later awarded temporary custody of him.</p>



<p>In September 2020, Jon was then accused of assaulting the poor child.</p>



<p>He defended himself against this charge by stating at the time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/11/jon-gosselin-details-argument-with-manic-son-denies-abuse-claims/">Collin was having a manic episode</a> and he was simply trying to restrain the young man.</p>



<p>This type of incident <em>does</em> seem to correlate with what Kate is saying about Collin above.</p>



<p><strong>All measures that were taken in our home were at the explicit recommendation of his pediatric psychiatrist and/or his team of specialists and were put into place to safeguard every member of our family, our friends as well as our family pets</strong>, concluded Kate in July.</p>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, I believe Collin remains a very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help.</strong></p>



<p><strong>His brothers and sisters and I have not been directly involved in his life due to his history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies towards us.</strong></p>



<p><strong>This is all I have to say on the matter and I will not be discussing this subject any further at this time.</strong></p>

<p>According to a pair of new reports, Kate Gosselin is not living her best life these days &#8212; in fact, she&#8217;s broke.</p>



<p>First, <em>The Sun</em> claims that the former reality star is living all by herself in North Carolina because the four kids in her care &#8212; Aaden, Alexis, Leah and Joel &#8212; all moved away.</p>



<p>Gosselin famously is the mother to eight children.</p>



<p>But two (Mady and Cara) are working in New York after graduating from college; while two others (Hannah and Collin) live with her ex-husband, Jon.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kate-gosselin-actually-broke">Is Kate Gosselin Actually Broke?</h2>



<p>One might think that Gosselin is using this opportunity to get a job and to pad her dwindling bank account, but, well&#8230;</p>



<p>“Kate hasn’t had a job other than reality TV for 17 years,&#8221; a source tells<em> The Sun</em>, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;It is very clear that Kate has no interest in living a normal life and having a real job.</p>



<p>“It looks like Kate’s financial situation is dire.”</p>

<p>Kate (whose nursing license expires in 2025) <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kate-gosselin-returns-to-reality-tv-breaks-down-on-air/">returned to television last year</a> for the first time since 2019 in order to appear on Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test.</p>



<p>Relatedly, the year prior, Jon accused Kate of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/jon-gosselin-i-just-hope-our-kids-know-kate-is-a-thief/">stealing over $100,000 from their kids&#8217; trust</a>. This is another example (if true) that the latter is desperate to make ends meet.</p>

<p><em>The Sun</em> also reports that she recently asked a judge to force her ex to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kate-gosselin-to-ex-husband-help-i-need-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pay her $132,875 in back child support </a>payments that she alleges Jon owes her from nearly a decade ago.</p>

<p>Kate Gosselin has said very little in public of late. But she was prompted back into the spotlight last summer after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/collin-gosselin-my-mom-sent-me-away-to-hide-her-abuse/">Collin accused his mother of abuse</a>.</p>



<p>The teenager claimed Kate sent him away to a special needs institution back when he was 13 in order to hide the way she had treated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never wanted to have to do this, but I feel I have been backed into a corner and left with no choice. Although it saddens me to do so, I need to speak out now,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kate-gosselin-breaks-silence-labels-son-as-troubled-young-man-who-needs-help/">Kate said to open a lengthy statement</a> on Instagram at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;My son Collin, whom I love with all my heart, has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years.</p>



<p>&#8220;For the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters and for his own well-being, he was placed in a facility following years of outpatient treatment which proved insufficient for his needs.</p>



<p>&#8220;The decision to admit him was made by emergency room doctors following one of his many attacks/outbursts — this one involving his use of a weapon.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-painful-situation">A Painful Situation</h2>



<p>Jon Gosselin rescued Collin from this facility in 2017 and was later awarded temporary custody of him.</p>



<p>In September 2020, Jon was accused of assaulting the child.</p>



<p>He defended himself against this charge by stating at the time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/11/jon-gosselin-details-argument-with-manic-son-denies-abuse-claims/">Collin was having a manic episode</a>, and he was simply trying to restrain the young man.</p>



<p>This type of incident&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;seem to correlate with what Kate is saying about Collin above.</p>

<p>&#8220;All measures that were taken in our home were at the explicit recommendation of his pediatric psychiatrist and/or his team of specialists and were put into place to safeguard every member of our family, our friends as well as our family pets,&#8221; concluded Kate in July of 2023.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I believe Collin remains a very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help.</p>



<p>&#8220;His brothers and sisters and I have not been directly involved in his life due to his history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies towards us.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is all I have to say on the matter and I will not be discussing this subject any further at this time.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-kate-gosselin-do-to-stop-being-broke">What Can Kate Gosselin Do to Stop Being Broke?</h2>



<p>Getting back to her financial issues, Kate&#8217;s options seem pretty limited at the moment.</p>



<p>Insiders say that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kate-gosselin-i-need-money-someone-give-me-a-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate wants a new reality show</a>, which makes sense, as that&#8217;s how she got rich in the first place. But that seems highly unlikely given the allegations against her.</p>



<p>She recently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kate-gosselin-shares-very-rare-photo-of-kids-celebrates-milestone-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a rare photo of her kids</a>, possibly as part of an effort to rehab her image. However, that&#8217;s probably a case of too little, too late.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been talk of Kate filing for bankruptcy. And that might be her best option at the moment.</p>



<p>She might also want to consider changing her name and moving to a new country!</p>

<p>Collin Gosselin has a message for his seemingly evil mother.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the former reality star spoke to The Sun about the fractured nature of his relationship with parent Kate Gosselin&#8230; about a month after leveling <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/collin-gosselin-abuse-claims-kate-basement-prison/">harrowing allegations against her</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="398" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/kate-gosselin-collin-gosselin-2022.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510898" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/kate-gosselin-collin-gosselin-2022.jpg 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/kate-gosselin-collin-gosselin-2022-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is a split screen of Kate Gosselin and one of her kids.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;First and foremost, my relationship with my brothers and sisters is of top priority to me,” the 20-year old told this outlet. </p>



<p>“And I think the only way that my mother and I would be able to reconnect and fix our relationship in the future is, if she would just come forward with the truth and all the things that she has kept under wraps.”</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a whole lot of background here.</p>



<p>In 2018, Jon Gosselin was awarded custody of his son after Collin wrote to his dad for help from a mental health facility. </p>



<p>A few years later later, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/collin-gosselin-my-mom-sent-me-away-to-hide-her-abuse/">Collin accused Kate of institutionalizing him</a> to cover up the abuse he suffered at her hands &#8212; as revealed in a bombshell July 2023 interview on Vice’s Dark Side of the 2000s series.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-1024x576.webp" alt="Collin Gosselin on air" class="wp-image-502400" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview.webp 1160w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Collin Gosselin no longer talks to his mother, Kate Gosselin.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Entertainment Tonight)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;You know the many times that she’s tried to soil my name and my father’s name,&#8221; Collin also told The Sun on October 8. &#8220;I just would want her to come forward with the truth. [But] yes, that door would be open, 100 percent.</p>



<p>Collin is one of Kate and Jon&#8217;s eight kids &#8212; including twins Mady and Cara, 24, and sextuplets Alexis, Aaden, Hannah, Leah and Joel, 20. </p>



<p>The family’s lives were chronicled on the TLC series Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 (later rebranded Kate Plus 8 after their 2009 divorce), which ran from 2007 to 2017.</p>



<p>At this point, Collin and Hannah live with their father (and don&#8217;t speak to their siblings), while Kate is has the others. And <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kate-gosselin-i-need-money-someone-give-me-a-tv-show/">also may have some money problems</a>.</p>

Anger often appears to be her default state. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last month, Collin told Sun that his mom was physically and verbally abusive toward him and even forced him to live in their home’s basement. </p>



<p>“My mother had a room built in our unfinished section of the storage basement. She had a room put up with cameras in it, a tiny window in the corner and it was bolt-locked from the outside,” he told the newspaper in an interview published on September 9. </p>



<p>“It was like a containment room, literally, and it had a mattress on the floor and that’s how I lived.”</p>



<p>He went on to note that Kate allegedly “zip-tied my hands and feet together and bolt locked the door, turned the lights off and had cameras there just watching me.”</p>

<p>Just absolutely horrible if true.</p>



<p>But Kate says these accusations are false.</p>



<p>“I’ve kept quiet for a LONG time but I’m tired of Collin and Jon controlling what has become my narrative— and it’s ALL false,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/collin-gosselin-reality-tv-return/">Gosselin previously said online</a>, slamming her ex-husband and her son.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not support fiction no matter who it comes from.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I can’t support ANY reports that are distorted and fictitious.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to a new report in In Touch Weekly, the mother of eight is not in great shape these days.</p>



<p>She needs money. She needs excitement. She needs a purpose in life.</p>



<p>“She doesn’t date or socialize with friends. Even her nursing job that paid her a fraction of what she made on Kate Plus 8 didn’t pan out,” the <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kate-gosselin-is-still-trying-to-get-a-new-show-amid-money-woes/">tabloid insider said</a>. “She’s hurting for money and facing the very real possibility of having to sell her house in North Carolina.”</p>



<p>This is not the first time we&#8217;ve heard about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kate-gosselin-to-ex-husband-help-i-need-money/">Gosselin&#8217;s financial problems</a>.</p>



<p>Her twins, Mady and Cara, are living in New York City, however, and her other kids are in college, which is causing observers to wonder why Kate needs such a large house &#8212; and to whom she can turn when sad or troubled.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-682x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510594" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1155327930-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Gosselin at The Levi&#8217;s Store Times Square on June 11, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“She’s still trying to get a new reality show, but doors aren’t opening for her, especially now that she’s been painted a lunatic mom who zip-tied and locked her son in the basement room,” In Touch writes adds. “No one would be surprised if she started begging for handouts.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true:</p>



<p>Last month, son Collin told the world that his mom used to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/collin-gosselin-abuse-claims-kate-basement-prison/">tie him up and lock him in the basement</a>.</p>



<p>“My mother had a room built in our unfinished section of the storage basement,” the 20-year-old told The Sun.</p>



<p>“She had a room put up with cameras in it, a tiny window in the corner and it was bolt-locked from the outside.”</p>



<p>Collin described the area as a “containment room&#8221; and alleged: &#8220;It had a mattress on the floor, and that was how I lived.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-1024x576.webp" alt="Collin Gosselin on air" class="wp-image-502400" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/221130083408-collin-gosselin-interview.webp 1160w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Collin Gosselin no longer talks to his mother, Kate Gosselin.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Entertainment Tonight)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Collin claimed awhile back that Kate sent him away to an institution for so-called behavioral issues as a young teenager, but in actuality was just trying to keep him quiet.</p>



<p>“I know my mother was going through a lot of things. I mean, a divorce and plenty of different things that can’t be easy to go through,” Collin also shared during a July 2023 interview with Vice TV’s Dark Side of the 2000s.</p>



<p>“And, you know, I want to think that she needed someone to take out her anger and her frustration on. And it was just kind of me, you know, I was in the way and I was there. So, she chose me.”</p>



<p>Shortly after this interview went viral, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kate-gosselin-my-ex-husband-my-son-are-liars/">Kate Gosselin denied all allegations of abuse</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510596" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-113815968-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Gosselin attends the Style Icon 2011 Luxury Gifting Suite at the Galt House &#8211; Day 1 at the Galt House Hotel &amp; Suites Grand Ballroom on May 6, 2011 in Louisville, Kentucky. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Gentner/Getty Images for Style Icon)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>At the time, Kate said her son has “received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years,” has had many “attacks/outbursts,” one of which involved a “weapon,” and:</p>



<p>“His brothers and sisters and I have not been directly involved in his life due to his history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies towards us.”</p>



<p>Kate concluded by stating “this is all I have to say on the matter and I will not be discussing this subject any further at this time.”</p>



<p>These days, amid her apparently financial troubles, the insider tells In Touch: </p>



<p>“The feeling is if she were a nicer person, nice things would come her way, but she’s not and karma’s kicking her in the butt.”</p>

<p>Collin Gosselin has leveled some shocking new abuse claims at his mother.</p>



<p>In a new interview, Collin alleges that Kate Gosselin &#8220;zip-tied&#8221; him and locked him in the basement when he was a child.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/collin-gosselin-i-was-discharged-from-the-marines-and-i-blame-my-mom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collin was discharged from the Marines</a>.</p>



<p> And he blamed that development on damaging remarks made by his mother.</p>

<p>“She had a room put up with cameras in it, a tiny window in the corner and it was bolt-locked from the outside.”</p>

<p>He also spoke with <em>The Sun </em>this week. He claimed that he did not know about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/collin-gosselin-trashes-mom-in-rare-tv-interview-she-tore-our-family-apart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate&#8217;s allegedly abusive behavior </a>until he obtained custody of their daughter Hannah.</p>



<p>“The room in the basement where she kept Collin is still there,” Jon claimed. </p>



<p>“My friend&#8217;s in-laws bought our house. And one time they asked me ‘Why is there a room in the basement with a bed and a lock on the outside?&#8217;”</p>

<p>“It must have been terrifying for [Collin].”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-claps-back">Kate Claps Back</h2>



<p>Kate has not personally responded to the allegations.</p>



<p>But her attorney, Richard Puleo, has denied she ever “intentionally” harmed Collin.</p>



<p>Puleo tells <em>The Sun</em> that she “did what she did to protect herself and her family” from her son’s “troubled behavior.”</p>

<p>in July 2023, Kate told <em><a href="https://people.com/kate-gosselin-breaks-silence-jon-collin-accusations-exclusive-7563700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> magazine that Collin was “very troubled young man.&#8221; She described him as having a “history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies.”</p>



<p>“[He] has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years. … Collin’s distorted perception of reality is one of the many issues that he has always struggled with,&#8221; Kate alleged.</p>



<p>With his military career behind him, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/collin-gosselin-marines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collin now says he&#8217;s planning to enroll in college</a>. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as more information becomes available.</p>

<p><em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> is returning with &#8220;new&#8221; episodes for some reason. And it may be only the beginning.</p>



<p>That is great news for Kate amidst her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kate-gosselin-to-ex-husband-help-i-need-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported financial struggles</a>. But it&#8217;s terrible news for basic decency.</p>



<p>Kate is a terrible person. Bad on camera, yes, but one need only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/collin-gosselin-my-mom-sent-me-away-to-hide-her-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask Collin Gosselin</a> to learn hear what she was like <em>off</em> camera.</p>



<p>Reality TV audiences have seen and learned a lot more since <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> first reared its ugly head. And they&#8217;re expressing their disgust that this shameful chapter in television history is staging a comeback.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jon-amp-kate-plus-8-is-coming-back-to-tlc">&#8216;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&#8217; is coming back to TLC</h2>



<p>In 2007, <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> premiered on TLC.<em> Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> followed the couple, their twins, and their sextuplets. The titular Jon and Kate Gosselin would go on to divorce in 2009. Two years later, TLC canceled the series.</p>



<p>In 2015, the show returned in a new form, airing three Kate-centric seasons from then until 2017. Then, our long national nightmare came to an end with the show&#8217;s cancelation. &#8230; Or so we thought.</p>



<p>This week, the TLC <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C--7DleCW7W/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> account posted a video showing early footage of <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em>. </p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s ready for a trip down memory lane?&#8221; TLC&#8217;s caption ominously threatened followers.</p>



<p>Then, the caption announced: &#8220;A #JonandKatePlus8 season 1 marathon starts TONIGHT at 8/7c!&#8221;</p>



<p>As one can easily imagine, the comments flooded with justified horror and outrage that TLC is once again platforming Kate Gosselin.</p>

<p>Comment after comment showed TLC&#8217;s own followers express their disgust.</p>



<p>&#8220;She should just be banned,&#8221; one Instagram user wrote of Kate Gosselin. Another labeled her &#8220;the OG Karen,&#8221; as Kate&#8217;s demeanor, vibe, and iconic haircut have been synonymous with &#8220;can I speak to the manager&#8221; attitudes since long before the name &#8220;Karen&#8221; described such a person.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve never watched 1 episode of that before. It always reeked of child exploitation to me,&#8221; another commenter opined. &#8220;Y’all can correct me if I’m wrong.&#8221; (This person is not wrong; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/jon-gosselin-pained-as-trolls-target-mady-wishes-he-could-have-protected-kids-from-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon Gosselin himself</a> has spoken about how he wished that he had spared his children from this)</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just replay the Duggars while you&#8217;re spotlighting abusers,&#8221; asked one commenter. To be clear, the comment was sarcastic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many worry that TLC may seriously consider this. A <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> marathon could be a trial balloon for putting Jim Bob Duggar and his horde of offspring back on TV.</p>



<p>Collin has described how <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/collin-gosselin-trashes-infamous-mother-says-kate-took-her-anger-out-on-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate made him a target</a> for her infamous anger. And in addition to the infamous abuses of their fundamentalist cult, the Duggars concealed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/josh-duggar-torture-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Duggar&#8217;s sex crimes</a> for years &#8212; until he finally committed a crime too small for Jim Bob to keep quiet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-would-anyone-put-the-gosselins-back-on-television-like-this">Why would anyone put the Gosselins back on television like this?</h2>



<p>Jon Gosselin was a loser and a disappointment. Kate Gosselin was infinitely worse. </p>



<p>However, TLC doesn&#8217;t seem to care about the moral behavior of its reality stars unless they impact the bottom line. Not the Duggars, not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/michael-ilesanmi-angela-deem-divorce-details-abuse-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abusive <em>90 Day Fiance</em> stars</a>, and not Kate.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery &#8212; as the network that churns out garbage like <em>Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</em> accumulated enough wealth to buy a cultural institution like Warner Bros &#8212; care about profit. While David Zaslav doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing a good job of generating profit these days (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-q2-earnings-report-2024-84f85759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBD is down like $10 billion</a>), he <em>ostensibly </em>hopes to make money. </p>



<p>Let us all hope that viewing numbers do not incentivize a return of Kate Gosselin to anyone&#8217;s TVs.</p>

<p>Kate Gosselin just shocked the world.</p>



<p>No, she didn&#8217;t make up with her ex-husband; and, no, she didn&#8217;t take any responsibility as a poor and/or selfish parents who has made many mistakes over the past many years.</p>



<p>Instead&#8230; Gosselin gave us an intimate glimpse at four of her kids!</p>

<p>The polarizing reality star shared a rare photo of four of her sextuplets via Instagram on Sunday, May 12, marking their 20th birthdays by doing so. </p>



<p>&#8220;No more teenagers in this house!&#8221; the 49-year-old wrote alongside a snapshot of children Alexis, Aaden, Leah and Joel, addling along with these words: </p>



<p>&#8220;Happy 20th birthday, my forever babies! I love you! Who feels old? I know I do! #20yearsold #ItsaPICKLE&#8221;</p>



<p>As you can see below, the kids are hanging out in front of a birthday cake with two numbered candles marking this milestone occasion. </p>



<p>Moreover, the chocolate-frosted cake is decorated with peppers and a pickle.</p>

<p>Gosselin, of course, has two <em>other</em> kids who also turned 20 over the weekend.</p>



<p>Their names are Hannah and Collin, but they&#8217;ve been living with <em>Jon</em> Gosselin for quite a long time now.</p>



<p>The former spouses (who became household names back when they were married and co-stars on the TLC reality show Jon and Kate Plus 8) certainly don&#8217;t talk&#8230; and rarely say nice things about each other in general.</p>



<p>Back in 2016, Collin was sent (by Kate) to live at Fairmont Behavioral Health Institute in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>He has since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/collin-gosselin-trashes-infamous-mother-says-kate-took-her-anger-out-on-him/">accused his mother of emotional and physical abuse</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;After being there, I didn&#8217;t have a relationship with her,&#8221; Collin has said of Kate in reference to being institutionalized. &#8220;Even before [being] there, I don&#8217;t think we had much of a relationship and I think that just kept tearing it even more down.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to the aforementioned accusations, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kate-gosselin-my-ex-husband-my-son-are-liars/">Kate has fired back at both Collin and Jon</a>, trashing them as liars.</p>



<p>“I’ve kept quiet for a LONG time but I’m tired of Collin and Jon controlling what has become my narrative &#8212; and it’s ALL false,” she wrote in July 2023, for example.</p>



<p>“Time to take back my own story!”</p>

<p>Kate Gosselin also issued a lengthy statement last summer on Instagram that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kate-gosselin-breaks-silence-labels-son-as-troubled-young-man-who-needs-help/">referred to Collin as troubled and violent</a>.</p>



<p>She said he has “received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years,” has had many “attacks/outbursts,” one of which involved a “weapon,” and:</p>



<p>“His brothers and sisters and I have not been directly involved in his life due to his history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies towards us.”</p>



<p>Kate concluded by stating “this is all I have to say on the matter and I will not be discussing this subject any further at this time.”</p>

<p>Jon &#8212; who has custody at this point of Collin and Hannah &#8212; also paid tribute to the sextuplets in an Instagram Live session this weekend. </p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re 20 either,&#8221; he responded to fan. &#8220;I wished all my kids happy birthday publicly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hannah, for her part, shared new images of herself on social media on her and her siblings&#8217; birthday. </p>



<p>&#8220;Made you look, twice,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram. #20thbirthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jon Gosselin sat down this week with Kevin Frazier of Entertainment Tonight to delve into his past and his potential future.</p>



<p>As previously reported, the reality-star-turned-DJ has been in a serious relationship for awhile now with someone named <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/stephanie-lebo-jon-gosselin-is-an-great-dad-yes-my-boyfriend-is-misunderstood/">Stephanie Lebo</a>.</p>



<p>We just weren&#8217;t aware of <em>how</em> serious this romance was.</p>



<p>Until now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love Stephanie and I have future plans with her, but I want to be in maybe the best shape of my life,&#8221; <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jon-gosselin-on-where-he-stands-with-ex-kate-and-when-he-plans-to-marry-girlfriend-stephanie-lebo">Gosselin told ET</a> of a potential proposal. </p>



<p>&#8220;She loves me for who I am, dad bod or whatever, but in my mind, you know, we all see ourselves as 25 and fit… that&#8217;s where I wanna be.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be clear, Gosselin uttered these words at Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center in Los Angeles, where the father of eight was in attendance because he&#8217;s undergoing ultrasound therapy for weight loss from wellness expert Dan Holtz.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have plans,&#8221; Gosselin added of what his future with Stephanie might look like. </p>



<p>&#8220;We have a house together… but I want to get this figured out, my health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked how his infamous ex-wife, Kate Gosselin, might respond to Jon getting married again?</p>



<p>To Jon bringing a quasi stepmother into the fold, at least for kids Collin and Hannah, who have been living under Jon&#8217;s roof for years now?</p>



<p>&#8220;Kate doesn&#8217;t care what I do,&#8221; Jon said to ET, taking yet another opportunity to trash the mother of his children: </p>



<p>&#8220;Kate does what Kate does. Kate only cares about Kate.&#8221;</p>

Rodriguez/Getty Images for WE tv)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jon went on to say that he doesn&#8217;t speak these days to Kate, which doesn&#8217;t mean he doesn&#8217;t often speak <em>about</em> her.</p>



<p>The disc jockey was awarded <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/jon-gosselin-my-custody-battle-is-over-see-ya-kate/">custody of Hannah and Collin</a> in May 2023, saying afterward to Us Weekly:</p>



<p>“It’s a very freeing feeling to not have to worry about lawsuits from Kate and really opens the door for me to reach out to my other children.</p>



<p>“I truly hope for the best.”</p>

<p>Jon and Kate share twin daughters, Mady and Cara, as well as sextuplets Hannah, Collin, Aaden, Joel, Leah and Alexis.</p>



<p>The former spouses split way back in 2009 and then Kate didn’t show up to a custody hearing for Collin in December 2018.</p>



<p>In August 2021, Hannah moved in with her father and brother.</p>



<p>Jon has no relationship with the kids who reside with Kate &#8212; and he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/jon-gosselin-trashes-ex-wife-again-claims-kate-gosselin-alienate/">blames Kate for this estrangement</a>.</p>



<p>“[Communicating with] the children that live with Kate is very difficult, because I don’t have an open relationship with them,” Jon whined in 2022, adding at the time:</p>



<p>“I think it was a poor parenting decision. It would’ve been much better if she would have been more open with them and explained things better…</p>



<p>“I have been alienated from those children.”</p>

<p>Welp. Here we go again.</p>



<p><strong><em>Again</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Two months ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/kate-gosselin-loses-child-support-case-will-she-file-for-bankruptcy/">Kate Gosselin lost her legal case</a> for $132,000, as the former reality star claimed in court that she was owed this amount of money in back child support payments from ex-husband Jon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/jon-gosselin-to-kate-gosselin-get-a-job-you-deadbeat/">Jon Gosselin responded at the time</a> by dragging the mother of his eight kids, telling Kate to get a job and earn her <em>own</em> paycheck.</p>

<p>“At this point Jon just hopes Kate realizes the kids are all grown up and it’s time to earn her own money,” an insider told In Touch Weekly of where Jon stands these days.</p>



<p>Now, in a discussion with The Sun, Jon spoke out for himself.</p>



<p>And he sang pretty much the same irritated tune.</p>



<p>“This thing has already been quashed by judges and she still won’t let it go,” <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/10165179/jon-gosselin-slams-kate-dragging-back-past/">Jon told this outlet</a> of Kate appealing the aforementioned child support decision. </p>



<p>“My hands are tied, there’s not much more I can do, I’m done hiring lawyers. I’ve spent every last penny. I work just to protect myself from her.”</p>

<p>Jon and Kate share eight children.</p>



<p>They used to star on a TLC reality show titled Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8, which took viewers behind the scenes of their unique and very busy household.</p>



<p>The spouses split in 2009, yet their feud refuses to die.</p>



<p>While Kate has starred in multiple spinoff programs (none of which were very popular), Jon has gone to work as a DJ.</p>



<p>He has custody of teenagers Collin and Hannah, the former of whom <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/kate-gosselin-my-ex-husband-my-son-are-liars/">has accused his mom of abuse</a>, and he&#8217;s confessed to having had no contact with his other sons and daughters in years.</p>

<p>“I’ve been moving on &#8212; I’ve said this so many times &#8212; and she keeps dragging me back to 2009,” Jon also told The Sun. </p>



<p>“Honestly I want to say to her: ‘Hey Kate, 2009 called, they want Jon back.’”</p>



<p>Gosselin added that Kate has taken “every ability” for him to make money because he allegedly wasn’t permitted to do television gigs because it would breach his TLC contract. </p>



<p>He claimed that Kate accused him of using his DJing as a “front for drug dealing,” even though he had “never touched drugs.”</p>



<p>“They’d tried every way to throw me under the bus,” he said of Kate and her attorneys. “I had to work three jobs just to pay the child support.”</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Jon is estranged from twins Mady and Cara, 22; along with sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Joel, and Leah, 19.</p>



<p>Their ongoing battle over child support began in March 2018 when Kate filed a complaint requesting payments from her ex. </p>



<p>It took years, but a judge rejected her request in November and then Kate filed her appeal last month.</p>



<p>A rep for Jon told The Sun back then: </p>



<p>“Jon finally thought he was free of Kate’s endless legal attacks. Unfortunately, Kate can’t seem to let this go despite the judge’s decisions. This doesn’t look good for her. I’m sure the judges won’t take kindly to this. She is free now that all her children are in college. </p>



<p>&#8220;This seems like just another very desperate move to make money. I think it’s time for Kate to get a job.”</p>
