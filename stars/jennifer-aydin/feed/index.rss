<p>Jennifer Aydin spoke on the <em>RHONJ </em>reboot reports&#8230;</p>



<p>And now, she&#8217;s landed herself in hot water with her tone-deaf response.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-reboot-confirmed-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andy Cohen&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> comments</a> hinted at upcoming changes to the longtime Bravo series.</p>



<p>Well, Jennifer Aydin had something to say about that. And she&#8217;s not eliciting a positive fan reaction.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-rhonj-reboot-really-happening">Is the &#8216;RHONJ&#8217; reboot really happening?</h2>



<p>This summer, Andy Cohen opened up about upcoming changes to <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>.</p>



<p>His <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-F1w2VxkJI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments</a> suggested a revamp of <em>RHONJ</em>. While he didn&#8217;t say that it would be a true reboot &#8212; that is, an all new cast &#8212; there could be serious changes and new faces.</p>



<p>Naturally, word of this quickly spun into a belief that every Housewife on <em>RHONJ </em>will soon be out of a job. Well, out of <em>this </em>job.</p>

<p>Andy stressed that he had been &#8220;riffing&#8221; when he joked to an argumentative caller than there would be &#8220;all new faces&#8221; on a <em>RHONJ </em>&#8220;reboot.&#8221; Are changes on the way? Almost certainly. But the reaction has been overblown.</p>



<p>(The caller in question had been a diehard Teresa Giudice fan, and wanted Melissa Gorga and Margaret Josephs gone)</p>



<p>Since his off-the-cuff remark made its way around the internet, multiple Housewives have responded. Including Jennifer Aydin.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-jennifer-aydin-say-about-the-rhonj-reboot-rumors">What did Jennifer Aydin say about the &#8216;RHONJ&#8217; reboot rumors?</h2>



<p>As you can see in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-IcA1rxhFz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@bravosnarkside</a> video below, which features a TikTok montage of multiple Housewives, Jennifer Aydin spoke on the <em>RHONJ </em>reboot story.</p>



<p>First, she emphasized that she believes that Bravo will make the best decision. That is, she was very diplomatically not biting the hand that currently feeds her.</p>



<p>“People sit there and like, ‘Oh, what if you didn’t do the show?’ I mean I don’t know,&#8221; Jennifer Aydin said. &#8220;I guess I will go back to counting my Ferraris and all the bathrooms and go back to my fabulous life.&#8221;</p>

<p>While having numerous bathrooms in a home suggests that it is newer, larger, and more expensive, it can be an odd status symbol. Some would argue that it sounds more <em>desperate </em>than the line about Ferraris. </p>



<p>Other criticisms in the comments described her as trying too hard. This is not uncommon among Real Housewives. Some (allegedly) rent nicer houses than they could afford without the show, simply to project a more opulent lifestyle for Bravo viewers.</p>



<p>Anyone at risk for losing a high-paying gig has two choices. They can beg to keep their job, or they can act like they don&#8217;t need it. Both have their merits. Jennifer Aydin has responded to the <em>RHONJ </em>reboot rumors with the latter. Only time will tell how that works out for her.</p>



<p>As for the show &#8230; we won&#8217;t actually know what comes next until after Bravo decides. And that&#8217;ll likely be <em>after </em>this season.</p>

<p>Insiders tell Page Six tell that these cast members got into heated exchange &#8212; <strong>which turned physical</strong> &#8212; during an event hosted by Teresa Giudice last Thursday night.</p>



<p>“Jennifer pushed Danielle during the argument and Danielle retaliated by crumpling her plastic cup and hurling it towards Jennifer’s face, drawing blood,” a source tells this publication.</p>



<p>There were no major injuries, just to be clear.</p>



<p>A second source tells this same outlet that Aydin sustained only a scratch when Cabral threw her beverage; while the former did not receive medical attention on site.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly what prompted the back-and-forth, but the reality stars have &#8220;been falling out all season, [although] this argument escalated in ways it hadn’t yet,&#8221; a source tells People Magazine.</p>



<p>As a result of the apparent incident, Aydin and Cabral were suspended from filming for numerous days; as of this writing, the suspension remains in place.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither filmed this weekend but they have scheduled scenes this week,&#8221; a second source explained to People.</p>



<p>Neither Aydin nor Cabral has commented on the controversy.</p>

<p>Dolores Catania and friends of the cast Jennifer Fessler and Jackie Goldschneider were present at the time of the altercation, while other cast members Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs and Rachel Fuda did <em>not</em> attend the gathering.</p>



<p>Aydin debuted on this franchise back in 2018, while Cabral who entered the Rea Housewives fray last year.</p>



<p>The two notably got along during Season 13, but their dynamic shifted in a major way while filming the upcoming Real Housewives of New Jersey installment.</p>



<p>“They have clashed a lot,” Page Six reports. </p>



<p>“Jennifer has accused Danielle of not donating money during a recent charity event, while Danielle has accused Jennifer of stealing her hairdresser.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last week&#8217;s episode of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> had tearful moments <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/jennifer-aydin-and-rachel-fuda-clash-in-foul-mouthed-hilarious-feud/">and hilarious feuds</a>.</p>



<p>This week, it came down to Jennifer Aydin and Margaret Josephs. They traded nasty barbs.</p>



<p>Both women went right for the jugular, but Margaret caused such a stir with her insults that it spilled over onto social media, dividing fans.</p>



<p>When Teresa said that it&#8217;s better to have Margaret as a friend than as an enemy, she meant it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of <em>RHONJ</em>, Jennifer Aydin accused Margaret Josephs of being a &#8220;bad friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>Margaret&#8217;s response? &#8220;You are nothing but a disheveled little drug addict!&#8221;</p>



<p>That reply came in shout form, while Jennifer Fessler interceded to calm things down. Despite being on camera, she worried what the neighbors might think if they heard the nasty exchange.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Margaret was referring to marijuana, apparently, which had fans live-tweeting to wonder if that even counts.</p>



<p>Marijuana is a drug. So is alcohol. So is aspirin. And so is caffeine. </p>



<p>Some noted that there&#8217;s &#8220;nothing wrong&#8221; with smoking marijuana, which is true. But saying that there&#8217;s something &#8220;wrong&#8221; with another drug or an addiction (legal or otherwise) to it is sort of moralizing an illness anyway. Touchy, complex subject. Weird place to go for an insult.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Aydin wore this gorgeous sequined blouse in a rich jade green while speaking to the confessional camera. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Later, Jennifer (Aydin) brushed it off, telling Teresa Giudice that she thinks that Margaret is just &#8220;jealous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Actually, to put it even more bluntly, she opined that &#8220;she&#8217;s a f&#8211;king hater.&#8221; And she did not stop there.</p>



<p>“But again, she is jealous, she’s a f&#8211;king jealous wench,&#8221; Jennifer insisted. &#8220;I’m living the f&#8211;king dream.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Love her, hate her, or just find her weirdly fascinating, Jennifer Aydin has been a fixture on The Real Housewives of New Jersey for years. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember, Margaret and Jennifer have clashed over Bill Aydin&#8217;s cheating. Why? Because Jennifer stayed with him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love the life we’ve created together and I know that bothers you so much,&#8221; Jennifer taunted in the confessional.</p>



<p>“I know you would love for me to just get divorced and break my home,&#8221; she continued.  &#8220;But I don’t run away at the first glimpse of unhappiness, so f&#8211;k you.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Anyway, Teresa Giudice discussed her then-upcoming wedding. She hoped to honor her late parents by including a personalized message in her bridal veil.</p>



<p>&#8220;It just came to me &#8211; another word: Sempre Insieme. It means always together,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>This from the woman who constantly scrambles words, memorably saying &#8220;blow my casket&#8221; during a dinner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice expressed her anger by saying &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna blow my casket,&#8221; which was not what she meant to say.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Teresa then broke down in tears, sharing that the phrase appears on her parents&#8217; mausoleum.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me cry,&#8221; Milania told her mother.</p>



<p>It is hard to watch your mother, or any loved one, cry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Danielle Cabral Braces for Drama at Her Daughter&#039;s Birthday | RHONJ Sneak Peek (S13 E5) | Bravo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9c3T9y-Grk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Then, at Danielle&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s birthday party, Teresa opened up about keeping Margaret at arm&#8217;s length despite ostenisbly making up.</p>



<p>“It’s better to have Margaret as a friend than as an enemy,&#8221; she reasoned. That is true of many people, but especially of Housewives.</p>



<p>Teresa then advised newcomers to the cast: “Do your homework and pay attention.” Spoken like a true mother of four.</p>

<p>Last week, <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> viewers saw just how ugly things could get.</p>



<p>To be blunt, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/joe-gorga-threatens-to-break-luis-ruelas-effing-balls/">Joe Gorga threatened to break Luis Ruelas&#8217; f&#8211;king balls</a>. <em>His </em>words, not ours.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night, it was Jennifer Aydin&#8217;s turn to clash &#8212; this time with Rachel Fuda. Honestly? This ugly exchange of insults ended up being <em>very </em>funny. You&#8217;ll see.</p>



<p>Also, Melissa ended up attending Teresa&#8217;s &#8220;love bubble&#8221; party (ugh) solo. She came alone, and she left in tears.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Rachel Fuda made it clear that she was happy that the party&#8217;s host had invited her sister-in-law. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This week&#8217;s episode showed Teresa and Luis&#8217; big housewarming party, featuring mouthwatering platters of pasta.</p>



<p>The cast of stunned Housewives watched with the rest of us as Jennifer Aydin confronted Rachel Fuda.</p>



<p>“I called [Rachel] up and I said, ‘I’m sorry that I spoke about your nose job,’” Jennifer announced. “People bad-mouth me about my terrible nose job.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Love her, hate her, or just find her weirdly fascinating, Jennifer Aydin has been a fixture on The Real Housewives of New Jersey for years. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I felt bad about your terrible nose job, and I just felt bad. I was calling to apologize,&#8221; Jennifer explained. Hilarious.</p>



<p>In a flashback of Jennifer&#8217;s nose job jab (or faux pas, to hear her tell it), we hear Rachel explain to her friend Jennifer Fessler.</p>



<p>“So we leave the mozz party, she calls me [and] she’s like, ‘Hey, I hope I didn’t offend you by, like, bringing up your nose job. You know I’m just like not really happy with my results,’” Rachel recalled.</p>

<p>According to Rachel, the call swiftly became Jennifer &#8220;s&#8211;t talking&#8221; Dolores Catania at her, leaving her feeling uneasy.</p>



<p>So, at the party, Rachel confronted Jennifer. </p>



<p>“You had started talking s&#8211;t [about Catania], and what did I say to you? You said, ‘I’m giving context,’ and I said, ‘Jennifer, don’t get me involved,’” Rachel noted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Aydin wore this gorgeous sequined blouse in a rich jade green while speaking to the confessional camera. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That is not how Jennifer remembers it. She insisted that she was merely relating their &#8220;history&#8221; to Rachel. Sure.</p>



<p>When Rachel disagreed, Jennifer ended up shouting &#8220;You f&#8211;king idiot!&#8221;</p>



<p>“Watch your f&#8211;king mouth,” Rachel demanded, instructing her &#8220;do not call me an idiot.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Fuda did not back down while defending her recollection of things. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“You f&#8211;king idiot!” Aydin shouted at Fuda, who clapped back saying,  and “do not call me an idiot.”</p>



<p>“F–king idiot,” Jennifer repeated, doubling down.</p>



<p>At this point, both Dolores and Margaret tried to calm things down. And Dolores felt &#8220;offended&#8221; that Jennifer had been badmouthing you. Very understandable.</p>

<p>“You want a medal? That’s good! Somebody give her a medal!” Jennifer replied (sarcastically) when people tried to diffuse the situation.</p>



<p>At this point, Rachel grabbed her husband, John Fuda. The two began to walk away. “Keep it moving, don’t let the door hit you on the ass on the way out!” Jennifer taunted as they left.</p>



<p>Rachel snapped back: “There’s no door, asshole!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that was not the only ugly business of the night.</p>



<p>See, Teresa ended up inviting her brother, Joe, to her housewarming &#8220;love bubble&#8221; party with Luis Ruelas.</p>



<p>It was an olive branch. And Joe and Teresa both told each other &#8220;I love you&#8221; before hanging up. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Gorga broke the news to his wife that, despite the olive branch, he couldn&#8217;t quite bring himself to attend his sister&#8217;s party. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, he later told Melissa that he couldn&#8217;t go. He felt like it was a set-up. Given how things have been going with Luis, that&#8217;s understandable.</p>



<p>Melissa opted to attend anyway. An olive branch for an olive branch. She felt sad that her nieces couldn&#8217;t see their uncle that night.</p>



<p>And then this happened:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-470115" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/0301_teresagiudice_luisruelas_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice thanked her &#8220;chosen family&#8221; for attending her and Luis Ruelas&#8217; housewarming &#8220;love bubble&#8221; party, which felt like a jab.

<p>Both Luis and Teresa stood up on a table and thanked everyone for attending. No problem, right? (Also, credit where credit is due: Luis is wearing a fantastic shirt here)</p>



<p>Then they called the assembled guests Teresa&#8217;s &#8220;chosen family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Did that feel like an odd choice of words, even a hurtful choice, in light of Joe&#8217;s absence? Margaret sure thinks so.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Margaret Josephs immediately picked up on what seemed like a deliberate jab and offered her sympathies. She also accurately predicted how things would play out. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Immediately, a number of people in the crowd offered words of comfort to Melissa Gorga.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s there without her husband, already reeling emotionally.</p>



<p>Margaret also predicted to the camera precisely how Teresa would respond &#8212; claiming that she was simply saying something nice, and that she didn&#8217;t mean anything by it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga became tearful during her sister-in-law&#8217;s housewarming party on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether she meant something by it or not, Teresa&#8217;s words were hurtful.</p>



<p>Eventually, Melissa ended up leaving with tears in her eyes.</p>



<p>It was a hard night for her. The clash between Rachel and Jennifer was much more fun to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Despite an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-feud-divides-cast-they-wont-be-in-a-room-together/">ongoing feud dividing the cast</a> ahead of the premiere, <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> is back.</p>



<p>Season 13 got off to an explosive start &#8212; with a fiery callback to the previous Reunion.</p>



<p>Jennifer Aydin blew up at Dolores Catania, and she didn&#8217;t mince words, either.</p>



<p>In fact, her word choice was such that we can&#8217;t quite repeat what she said. She called Dolores a &#8220;f&#8211;king c&#8211;t,&#8221; and that&#8217;s only part of it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Okay, so what happened during Season 13, Episode 1 of <em>RHONJ </em>to set things off?</p>



<p>It started at a get-together that we saw late in the episode.</p>



<p>Many of the cast members were getting along. Some newer feathers ended up ruffled, but that&#8217;s pretty normal for a show like this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>However, Jennifer was talking about Dolores behind her back.</p>



<p>According to Jennifer, Dolores had shown her &#8220;disrespect&#8221; despite Jennifer having &#8220;kissed her motherf&#8211;king ass.&#8221;</p>



<p>So not only were her words clearly unkind, but it was all behind Dolores&#8217; back. But not for long.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Dolores overheard Jennifer and later pulled her aside.</p>



<p>Jennifer would go on to claim that she had been speaking about her like this in order to bring about a one-on-one conversation. </p>



<p>What, Jennifer the master strategist? Jennifer the manipulation prodigy? Anyway, if that really was her plan, it worked. Sort of.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“What the f–k is this? Third grade? It has to stop,” Catania commented. She told the confessional camera that she was now &#8220;f&#8211;king mad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Jennifer confronted her, accusing her of not being a &#8220;good friend&#8221; and of opting to &#8220;jump ship&#8221; on their friendship.</p>



<p>Why? Because Dolores didn&#8217;t condemn Margaret Josephs over the whole <em>Bill Aydin adultery slash hypocrisy </em>discussion during Season 12.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“You know what? You and I don’t agree on what a good friend is,” Dolores then stated.</p>



<p>Jennifer agreed, but added in a “I’m nice. You’re not,&#8221; for good measure. She then doubled down, telling Dolores that she&#8217;s &#8220;not f&#8211;king nice.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dolores countered that &#8220;no one has anything nice to say&#8221; about Jennifer, Ouch!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I thought you were my friend, [but] I just realized I never had one,” Jennifer yelled. This began to sound more and more juvenile.</p>



<p>She added: “Noted – she’s never been my friend, she’s a f&#8211;king phony, she’s f&#8211;king two-faced.”</p>



<p>Eventually, the other ladies swooped in to try to make peace (or at least be on screen for the fight). Bill tried to coax Jennifer into leaving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I thought she was going to be nice and then she’s a f–king c–t that she always is,&#8221; Jennifer spet as she left.</p>



<p>She blew a kiss in Dolores&#8217; direction, saying &#8220;I learned that word from you, babe.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was a reference to Dolores using the same insult for her during the previous Reunion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjlcsuj_uWU
</div></figure>



<p>Dolores expressed her sympathies that Bill is her &#8220;poor&#8221; husband who has to &#8220;go home with her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Jennifer griped &#8220;f&#8211;k her, f&#8211;k her, she looks like an old f&#8211;king handbag.&#8221; Super harsh, ladies.</p>



<p>Interestingly, odds are pretty good that they&#8217;ve made peace since this fight. Other cast members? Not so much.</p>

<p>Last month, Gorga and fellow Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member Aydin made headlines when an argument between the pair at the Gansevoort Hotel was caught on camera. </p>



<p>Shortly after the altercation, which included Aydin hurling her drink in the direction of Joe, Aydin’s social media assistant, Erica Madelyn, alleged in a TikTok video that Joe called her boss a “<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/melissa-gorga-jennifer-aydin-threw-her-drink-cause-joe-called-her-a-dirty-bitch/">f—king dirty bitch</a>.”</p>



<p><em>Yikes</em>, huh? Except&#8230;</p>

<p>“Everything that you heard is a lie,” Gorga claimed during an episode of the “Chicks in the Office” podcast on Friday, November 11, adding:</p>



<p>“The story is out there that she threw a drink at me, and I was saying these vulgar things to her. No.”</p>



<p>According to Joe, his wife, Melissa, “did say something” to Aydin, which caused the beverage to be thrown.</p>



<p>He blames everything on Aydin, however.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p> “If you watched her on the TV show through the years — she drinks a lot, she’s violent, she throws thing, she breaks glasses, she wants to stab you with it. She throws knives,” the businessman alleged. </p>



<p>“I mean, this is who she is, she’s crazy. </p>



<p>&#8220;Picture her in real life. That’s editing!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Joe Gorga looks pretty fired up in this photo from The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Joe confirmed on the aforementioned podcast that he got into a shouting match with Aydin&#8230; but clarified that the drink didn’t end up on him. </p>



<p>“She was out of control to the point where it was embarrassing,” he said on air. </p>



<p>“Yelling at the top of her lungs like a maniac.”</p>



<p>In late October, Melissa came forward her own account of the events, stating on her “On Display” podcast that Aydin gave her a “snarky stare in [her] eyes” as the Bravo personality made her way toward the elevators.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Aside from her assistant’s statements, Aydin has not addressed the altercation in depth.</p>



<p>However, a source previously told Us Weekly that Bravo was “not happy” after they learned about the scandal.</p>



<p>“Bravo PR did their best at keeping the split sides apart throughout the weekend but what happened outside of BravoCon was out of their control,” this insider revealed, noting there was an attempt to keep the cast “divided” throughout the weekend, but “they did cross paths.”</p>



<p>That same month, Andy Cohen weighed in on the drama, telling Entertainment Tonight: </p>



<p>“I think it’s gross. Period dot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last weekend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/jennifer-aydin-threw-her-drink-at-joe-gorga-you-betrayed-teresa/">Jennifer Aydin chucked her drink </a>during some sort of altercation involving Joe Gorga.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly a secret. It happened in the hotel lobby at BravoCon. People saw it. We even have a GIF of it.</p>



<p>Initially, no one knew the motive. Many assumed that Jennifer was just standing up for Teresa Giudice.</p>



<p>That may have factored into it, but Melissa Gorga admits that Jennifer&#8217;s actual motive was a little more immediate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We already knew that Jennifer Aydin and Joe Gorga had some sort of heated confrontation.</p>



<p>Not only did she seemingly throw her drink onto her castmate, but it looks like she also threw her cup.</p>



<p>It was a cup &#8212; plastic, most likely &#8212; and not a glass. Usually, these antics go down on the show, not behind the scenes like this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Now, Melissa Gorga has opened up <a href="https://www.podcastone.com/pd/Melissa-Gorga-On-Display">on her <em>Melissa Gorga On Display</em> podcast</a> about what happened.</p>



<p>She kept things thinly veiled, but shared that fans told her &#8212; in person &#8212; at BravoCon that &#8220;another cast member&#8221; was &#8220;bashing&#8221; her.</p>



<p>Imagine hearing that one of your castmates is dragging your name through the mud at the same event, to the same people who are coming to see you. And then you hear about from them. <em>Wow</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>During one of the BravoCon panels, Jennifer announced to the crowd that Melissa and Joe&#8217;s RHONJ future was in danger.</p>



<p>She claimed that the couple are &#8220;holding on for dear life&#8221; to their endangered reality TV careers.</p>



<p>On her podcast, Melissa clapped back: “First of all, stay in your lane. Second of all, I’m not sure which show you’re watching.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>According to Melissa, she and Joe were in the hotel and chatting with cast members from <em>Family Karma</em>.</p>



<p>This, she recalled, was when Jennifer Aydin and her assistant walked into the lobby.</p>



<p>Allegedly, Jennifer glared at Melissa with a &#8220;snarky stare in [her] eyes while heading towards the elevator.</p>

<p>It could have ended there. </p>



<p>But well behaved women rarely make the cast of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>.</p>



<p>By her own account, Melissa said: &#8220;Keep moving, wannabe. Come on, loser, just keep walking. There’s the elevator.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>According to Melissa, she did not do any &#8220;yelling or screaming&#8221; herself.</p>



<p>But she claimed that Jennifer had been &#8220;at a party before&#8221; arriving and &#8220;did not like&#8221; the comment.</p>



<p>Clearly, Melissa is insinuating that Jennifer had been drinking. Not scandalous, but it is what it is.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Melissa Gorga was one of the most outspoken castmates at the Reunion Part 1.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Melissa alleged that Jennifer began &#8220;screaming&#8221; and &#8220;yelling&#8221; and &#8220;cursing&#8221; in her direction.</p>



<p>She and Joe, Melissa said, were &#8220;still by the front door&#8221; where they had been before Jennifer&#8217;s arrival.</p>



<p>“My assistant, somebody that I work with, walks over to [Aydin]. … He goes, ‘You’re acting like trash. You can’t do this. Go inside. Stop yelling. Why are you acting like trash? Get out of here,&#8217;” Melissa recalled.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“She freaked out that he said that, OK?&#8221; Melissa described.</p>



<p>&#8220;Joe is now seeing her freak out, and Joe &#8212; and I have to say, I don’t think we give Joe enough credit,&#8221; she said of her husband.</p>



<p>Melissa then continued by acknowledging: &#8220;And he’s 100 percent wrong sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he literally said, ‘I don’t even know how this dirty bitch is on the show,'&#8221; Melissa quoted Joe.</p>



<p>&#8220;He did say that out loud,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;but he said it to the other people we were talking to.&#8221;</p>



<p>Melissa went on to confess: &#8220;Is he right? No, but he said that.”</p>

<p>This is apparently when Jennifer hurled her drink, catching Melissa&#8217;s assistant (and seemingly Joe) with her liquid.</p>



<p>Apparently the beverage got &#8220;all over the lobby&#8221; and &#8220;all over the security guard&#8221; who works for th ehotel.</p>



<p>“By the way, she should probably take care of his dry cleaning bill,” Melissa suggested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Melissa Gorga has had it with her husband. Will she really file to divorce him?</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to her narrative, Jennifer found herself being “escorted” up to her hotel room.</p>



<p>Melissa felt that Jennifer had caused a “scene” and ignited “tension that’s unnecessary at a celebratory event.”</p>



<p>It sort of feels like Jennifer was not the only culprit here. But she was clearly out of line. She just &#8230; wasn&#8217;t the only one.</p>

<p>We all heard a lot about who booed whom and who showed up at BravoCon 2022.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/teresa-giudice-fame-and-money-ruined-my-family/">Teresa Giudice made some surprising comments</a> at the convention, but she was obviously not the only <em>RHONJ </em>star present.</p>



<p>Jennifer Aydin was there. Joe Gorga was there.</p>



<p>And, ever firmly tucked away in Teresa&#8217;s corner, Jennifer allegedly threw her drink on Joe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We have all heard a lot about Teresa Giudice and her &#8220;minions.&#8221; </p>



<p>Half of the time, people just mean Jennifer Aydin.</p>



<p>Sure enough, Tre was allegedly front and center over the reported altercation that went down over the weekend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Teresa Giudice posed beside castmate, friend, and minion Jennifer Aydin at Tre&#8217;s bridal party.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Not all of the BravoCon drama went down during official panels, folks.</p>



<p>Jennifer Aydin and Joe Gorga were both in the lobby of their hotel in New York City.</p>



<p>This all went down on Sunday, October 16.</p>

<p>It is unclear what the two could possibly have been discussing.</p>



<p>But, in a video that social media users circulated with gleeful abandon, not even two security guards could prevent Jennifer from getting Joe.</p>



<p>In the video, she appears to dash Joe with a clear liquid.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We also see Jennifer throw her empty plastic cup at her castmate.</p>



<p>Some viewers of the video observed that she seemed to call him &#8220;Popeye&#8221; in anger.</p>



<p>Jennifer did not exactly walk up to the random fan recording the exchange to explain. However, many have guessed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Jennifer Aydin defends herself, using witty comebacks after being called &#8220;tone deaf.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Widespread speculation says that the point of contention is a familiar one.</p>



<p>This summer, Teresa Giudice married Luis &#8220;Louie&#8221; Ruelas, emphasizing the final word of &#8220;for better or for worse.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a fit of drama that has not yet unfolded on our screens, Melissa and Joe Gorga ended up not attending the nuptials. At all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t take an inside scoop to know that Jennifer Aydin was always going to take Teresa&#8217;s side in this dispute.</p>



<p>After all, this is what she does.</p>



<p>(Many of us sometimes wonder about when she will <em>snap </em>and turn on Tre &#8230; but that day has not yet come)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But we needn&#8217;t imagine how Jennifer feels about it.</p>



<p>At BravoCon, she spoke directly on the topic.</p>



<p>Specifically, Jennifer doesn&#8217;t feel that it was right for Joe and Melissa to ghost the wedding &#8212; no matter what.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“I understand that the reasoning they didn’t wanna go to the wedding was very superficial,&#8221; Jennifer claimed <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/rhonjs-jennifer-aydin-throws-drink-at-joe-gorga-amid-teresa-drama/">to <em>Us Weekly</em></a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she then asserted, &#8220;not matter of fact at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>When it comes to Joe, Jennifer speculated: “I think he’ll regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Just ’cause you don’t regret something now doesn’t mean that one day you won’t regret it,&#8221; Jennifer imparted at BravoCon.</p>



<p>&#8220;So things may be still hot for him,&#8221; she said, referring to Joe&#8217;s emotional state. </p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Jennifer then observed, &#8220;it is still very raw.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Jennifer even wondered if Joe and Melissa might feel differently after they watch Season 13.</p>



<p>“Plus, the season hasn’t even aired yet,&#8221; she noted. Many reality stars find it illuminating to view themselves through the TV lens.</p>



<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she added, &#8220;we are going to relive all these moments over again.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>This is a still image taken from the video Jennifer Aydin filmed to announce she has Covid-19.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“In addition to that, [we’ll] see what people said about us in confessionals,&#8221; Jennifer voiced.</p>



<p>Speaking from experience, she commented: &#8220;which could always be very hurtful.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jennifer described: &#8220;So [it] kind of like builds up the feelings all over again.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;So I don’t think that he’ll regret it maybe anytime soon,&#8221; Jennifer allowed.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she clarified, &#8220;I do feel that one day he will regret it.”</p>



<p>Perhaps. But that is not how Joe was feeling last week, two days before he found himself in the splash zone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Joe Gorga looks pretty fired up in this photo from The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I made a decision, and I don’t regret anything I do,” Joe asserted on Friday, October 14.</p>



<p>“I would regret it if that was me and everything’s reversed,&#8221; he said, meaning that he would have done things differently had he been in Teresa&#8217;s shoes.</p>



<p>Joe stated: &#8220;I’d be kicking myself in the ass every day.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“That’s my only family. So, what do you think? Yeah, it was devastating,” Teresa admitted on Saturday, October 15.</p>



<p>“I mean, the day before [our wedding], I was in tears ‘cause I just found out,&#8221; she expressed.</p>



<p>Teresa added: &#8220;It was heartbreaking [because] it’s my only family, and Luis was hurting for me. My children were hurting. But then [on] that day, that day was our day.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Judging from the <a href="/videos/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-reunion-trailer-im-done-f-k-yo/"><em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> Season 12 Reunion trailer</a> alone, things are <em>beyond </em>tense for this cast.</p>
<p>Accusations, screaming, and obscenities are normal. Threats to quit on the spot are not.</p>
<p>Dolores Catania took things up a notch as she put Jennifer Aydin on blast.</p>
<p>She bypassed the regular insults and went for the jugular, calling her the C-word with her whole chest.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Season 12 RHONJ Reunion special does not begin airing until May 3, but the trailer gave us plenty to digest.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt that Dolores had a hidden agenda,&quot; Jennifer is shown telling Andy Cohen in the trailer.</p>
<p>Mind you, she&#8217;s seated right next to Dolores &#8230; which is incredibly awkward.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Things escalate quickly when we see Dolores remark &quot;This f&#8211;king c&#8211;t,&quot; dropping the C-word.</p>
<p>Normally, we&#8217;d love to say that maybe this is out of context, but there&#8217;s no question at whom Dolores&#8217; words are aimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#8217;t call me a f&#8211;king c&#8211;t,&quot; Jennifer screams back at her.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Here we go, here we go,&quot; Melissa Gorga remarks in reaction to the conflict.</p>
<p>Obviously, we are denied the full context and aftermath of this.</p>
<p>The trailer&#8217;s job is to tease, not to give away everything that goes down on that messy stage.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, we can certainly discuss the friction between these two.</p>
<p>For most of Season 12, Jennifer and Dolores seemed to be doing just fine in terms of friendship and getting along.</p>
<p>However, Jennifer characterized Dolores as being a &quot;jerk&quot; to her as the show was airing &#8230; a claim that changed everything.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-reunion-trailer-im-done-f-k-yo"></a></figure>
<p>&ldquo;She claims to defend me &#8212; and she does in real life, she really does defend me,&quot; Jennifer said during an interview in February.</p>
<p>&quot;And I love her,&quot; she added. &quot;And I thought, &lsquo;She loves me in real life.&quot;</p>
<p>Jennifer then continued: &quot;And sometimes is a jerk to me on the show.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;But now I&rsquo;m starting to realize she doesn&rsquo;t like me,&quot; Jennifer shared.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she speculated, perhaps Dolores &quot;just appeases me for the show.&quot;</p>
<p>Jennifer expressed: &quot;So I don&rsquo;t know where we stand.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jennifer noted: &quot;I just know some of the things I saw [this season] were really hurtful.&quot;</p>
<p>She remained optimistic, at least back in February.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Jennifer said, &quot;we can try and work it out at the reunion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Weeks later, Dolores offered a public reply &#8230; and was clearly less than pleased.</p>
<p>She declared that she does not &quot;give a f&#8211;king motherf&#8211;k,&quot; which is an amazing unit of measure.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven&#8217;t [spoken],&quot; she said in a March interview. &quot;She&#8217;ll speak to me at the reunion.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Save it for the camera, fine,&quot; Dolors expressed, as if directing her words at Jennifer personally.</p>
<p>&quot;But have your peace with me and say it to my face before,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>Dolores then asked: &quot;Like, what even is that?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I was upset by it,&quot; Dolores admitted. &quot;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;What are you talking about?&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>According to some, Jennifer may have just been repeating whatever observation Teresa had made.</p>
<p>&quot;But I dont really give a f&#8211;king motherf&#8211;k,&quot; Dolores emphasized, &quot;so that&rsquo;s really too bad, Jennifer.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve stuck up for you every episode, even when you were not defendable,&quot; Dolores recalled.</p>
<p>As for why Jennifer made those remarks, Dolores speculated: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not for attention, [why] do you have to wait to tell me at the reunion?&quot;</p>
<p>Dolores then warned: &quot;Know that I will be a different person to you now for the rest of your life.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week,<em> The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> viewers saw tensions explode as <a href="/videos/bill-aydin-explodes-at-joe-gorga-evan-goldschneider-my-wifes-not/">the husbands clashed</a>.</p>
<p>That conflict is far from over, but there&#8217;s much more to come.</p>
<p>Bravo just dropped the Season 12 midseason trailer and it is filled with happy times, sad moments, and absolute fury.</p>
<p>Teresa doesn&#8217;t want anyone talking about her man &#8230; even if they&#8217;re only repeating what <em>everyone </em>is saying.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Like almost all trailers for this franchise &#8212; or any other reality series &#8212; things don&#8217;t start off on a sour note.</p>
<p>Instead, we get to see the Housewives and their husbands laughing and joking around together.</p>
<p>From trying extra spicy food (with kisses) to sharing laughs, even the most dramatic cast members are having fun.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On a less cheerful note, Teresa&#8217;s daughters have to cope with leaving their childhood home.</p>
<p>They have a lot of memories in that place, and have to pack things up and move.</p>
<p>Teresa&#8217;s relationship with Luis &quot;Louie&quot; Ruelas is getting more serious, which further complicates things.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Moving is going to be very sad,&quot; Gia admits.</p>
<p>Though she is 21, she still has a lot of connections to that house.</p>
<p>18-year-old Gabriella is more direct, admitting: &quot;I don&#8217;t want to leave this house.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;The only memories that we&#8217;re going to have was here with dad,&quot; Gabriella adds.</p>
<p>It is not as if they can make new ones in the United States, after all.</p>
<p>After hearing this, we see Teresa herself burst into tears over the emotional weight of this change.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The meat of the midseason trailer also relates to Teresa, but it is not about her children.</p>
<p>We see Joe Gorga, Teresa&#8217;s brother, questioning Luis about his past.</p>
<p>A lot has been said &#8230; and Luis seems on the fence about defending his poor reputation.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not going to sit here and say that I was this crown of a man,&quot; Luis admits.</p>
<p>This being a trailer, we do not get to see the full context of that.</p>
<p>But things don&#8217;t get explosive until the titular Housewives dig into the topic.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Teresa is feeling downright hostile, accusing Margaret of &quot;dragging&quot; Luis&#8217; name &quot;through the mud,&quot; as if she weren&#8217;t just repeating what&#8217;s been widely reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Like this one, he&#8217;s abusive,&quot; we hear in the trailer at one point.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#8217;t say he was abusive,&quot; Margaret clarifies. &quot;All the girlfriends said he was abusive.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We later see Margaret angrily declare: &quot;I&#8217;ll tell you where she belongs: a zoo.&quot;</p>
<p>That is not the end, as she adds &quot;I&#8217;m f&#8211;king done.&quot;</p>
<p>Margaret is heard warning: &quot;She f&#8211;ked with the wrong girl.&quot; Presumably, she is referring to Tre.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all about Tre and Margaret butting heads, either.</p>
<p>Things have gotten difficult between Jennifer Aydin and her husband, Bill, this season.</p>
<p>&quot;You were doing your thing without any consideration of me,&quot; she says, confronting him.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jennifer speaks to Margaret about these difficulties and Bill&#8217;s perceived lack of interest in putting in the work.</p>
