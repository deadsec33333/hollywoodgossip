<p>Taylor Lautner has gone there, folks. </p>



<p>He really, truly has.</p>



<p>And now we may need to pray for the actor as a result.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="932" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1024x932.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513447" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1024x932.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-300x273.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-768x699.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-2048x1865.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-960x874.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1080x983.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1200x1093.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Lautner attends the 13th annual NFL Honors at Resorts World Theatre on February 8, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This past Saturday, Lautner jumped on TikTok to take part in the latest viral trend… which features user making bold statements before &#8220;accidentally&#8221; turning the camera on themselves.</p>



<p>In his case, Lautner went WAY back in time, starting his footage with a look at the 2011 blockbuster The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 1, as it played on a flat-screen television and honed in on the scene where Bella Swan marries her vampire lover, Edward Cullen.</p>



<p>(Swan was played by Kristen Stewart and Cullen was played by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/robert-pattinson/">Robert Pattinson</a>, both of whom turned into enormous stars after taking on these beloved roles.)</p>



<p>Lautner &#8212; who portrayed Edward&#8217;s occasional rival, Jacob and who has gone on to star in Shark Boy and Lava Girl &#8212; wrote over the clip: </p>



<p>“Honestly screw Edward. Bella should have ended up with Jacob.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="570" height="928" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/taylor-lautner-suggests-twilight-shouldve-93849599.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513450" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/taylor-lautner-suggests-twilight-shouldve-93849599.webp 570w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/taylor-lautner-suggests-twilight-shouldve-93849599-184x300.webp 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (TikTok)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 32-year old then jokingly flipped the camera back on himself, acting shocked and afraid with the text “oh no no no” written on the screen.</p>



<p>He was obviously just having fun, but Lautner was also taking a chance because the Bella/Edward romance simply dominated pop culture back in the day.</p>



<p>Stewart and Pattinson became a couple while filming this franchise and loyal Twilight Saga fans engaged in plenty of debates at the time over just who Bella should have married.</p>



<p>We now know where Lautner stands.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513451" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Lautner reacts on the sideline prior to a game between the Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions in the NFC Wild Card Playoffs at Ford Field on January 14, 2024 in Detroit, Michigan. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Nic Antaya/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thankfully, Lautner earned praise for his joke, as nearly every user was well aware he was just kidding around. </p>



<p>“HE WON THIS TREND,&#8221; one person wrote in response, for example.</p>



<p>“This made my year,” another added.</p>



<p>Lautner starred as Jacob Black in the Twilight Saga from 2008 to 2012, earning massive praise and also many comparisons to Pattinson.</p>



<p>“We never really connected on a deep level just because we’re different humans,” Lauter said last year about his former co-star, explaining on the Call Her Daddy podcast that Pattinson is “fantastic” and “the sweetest person ever.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Billie Lourd went through what we hope will be the hardest experience of her life last December, and boyfriend Taylor Lautner was there by her side for that. Even as recently as May, the two still seemed joined at the hip, attending a Britney Spears concert together and posting about it.</p>
<p>But for over a month now, they&#8217;ve both seemed to ignore each other on social media, declining even to &quot;like&quot; each other&#8217;s photos. People noticed and wondered if something was up.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like this young, unspeakably beautiful couple has called it quits.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Billie Lourd is one of the stars of Ryan Murphy&#8217;s <em>Scream Queens</em> and she appeared in <em>Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens</em>, but the world knows her best as Carrie Fisher&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>And, of course, as Debbie Reynolds&#8217; granddaughter.</p>
<p>Fans knew who she was, but she became impossible to miss after <a href="/2016/12/carrie-fisher-dies-beloved-star-wars-actress-was-60/">Carrie Fisher&#8217;s tragic death</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no insult to her budding career.</p>
<p>Taylor Lautner might not have such famous relatives, but he&#8217;s extremely well-known.</p>
<p>Mostly, even now, for his role in the <em>Twilight </em>series that made no shortage of grown women tweet all <em>sorts </em>of things before finding out that he was only 17 when <em>New Moon</em> came out.</p>
<p>The guy&#8217;s got abs for days.</p>
<p>Together, they were a lovely couple.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This is no longer just speculation based on who does and doesn&#8217;t double-tap photos on Instagram.</p>
<p><a href="http://people.com/movies/billie-lourd-taylor-lautner-split/">Billie Lourd and Taylor Lautner have broken up</a> for realsies, according to <em>People</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;They aren&rsquo;t together anymore but they are still friendly,&quot; their source says.</p>
<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s really focused on her work right now.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s more than understandable.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not going to make this about Carrie Fisher&#8217;s death and Billie throwing herself into her work to cope.</p>
<p>(Though that could be a factor)</p>
<p>Billie is only at the start of what could be a long and epic career, and she surely wants to be taken seriously as an actress.</p>
<p>But we really don&#8217;t know what brought about this split.</p>
<p>And though Billie Lourd included the term &quot;Eiffel Tower&quot; in the captions of this photo of herself with Taylor Lautner and John Stamos a while back &#8230; we don&#8217;t think that this breakup was caused by post-threesome fallout.</p>
<p>(Probably)</p>
<p>She might not even know that Eiffel Tower is a sex position &#8230; even though that level of naivete would be hard to imagine in anyone her age, especially Carrie Fisher&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Whatever the cause, gone are the days when Billie Lourd <em>appears </em>to post about wanting a threesome with John Stamos.</p>
<p>(Maybe)</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not going to fall into that trap of bemoaning a couple breaking up just because we got used to the idea of them as a couple.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both young and talented and beautiful.</p>
<p>(Yes, even Taylor Lautner, who we <em>swear </em>wasn&#8217;t just hired for his almost comically perfect body &#8230; probably)</p>
<p>They have their whole lives ahead of them.</p>
<p>Billie and Taylor will always have their memories, but life usually involves a whole bunch of different lovers before you find your perfect match.</p>
<p>If you ever do.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We hope that they&#8217;re both doing okay, emotionally.</p>
<p>Breakups are hard.</p>
<p>And we especially hope for the best for Billie, because let&#8217;s not pretend that seven months is enough time to get over losing two of the most important people in your life.</p>
<p>Honestly, <em>I&#8217;m</em> still not over Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to imagine that she is.</p>
<p>But <a href="/2017/06/billie-lourd-speaks-out-about-carrie-fishers-toxicology-report/">Billie Lourd is well-spoken</a> and a skilled actress.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s amazing and she can do anything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been a long wait, you guys!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve waited just over one month for <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/2016/11/watch-scream-queens-online-season-2-episode-5/">Scream Queens Season 2 Episode 5</a>, and it really delivered on the shocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We picked up right where we left off, with Chanel #5 being stabbed in the back and Denise being pretty <em>dead</em>. Dean Munsch knew she needed to get rid of the body if there was any way of saving the hospital, but then it was revealed that every other patient had been murdered.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/season-2/chanel-pour-homme-icide/"></a></figure><figcaption>Watch Scream Queens Season 2 Episode 5 Online</figcaption>
<p>The Chanels and Zayday&nbsp;told Munsch it was time to go to the cops and she reluctantly agreed. However, she asked Zayday to help her with something and the two of them went to dispose of Denise&#8217;s body. Munsch revealed Denise was brain dead and that they could freeze her until they found a cure for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The did the deed, and Munsch agreed that her dream hospital was over. But, in true comedy fashion, we went three weeks later and the hospital was busier than ever. All of the bad press helped the hospital get enough recognition to become a fully functioning one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All it took was a string of murders from the Green Meanie. With the hospital being super busy and Chanel #5 bed bound due to the attack on her, Chanel and #3 were tasked with cleaning all the dirty things in the hospital. Chanel decided she was over it and went forward with a plan to bring in some new Chanels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She reeled in a man who was so obsessed with her that he sent her fan fiction about her life. It was totally tragic and pretty unsafe, but he was a number. She also reeled in two crazy patients from the hospital and Hester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the murderer who tormented their college years got back to being a Chanel. The reason? The mind of a serial killer will help them when the killer inevitably attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay then.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/canceled-which-shows-are-not-returning-next-season/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"></div><h2 class="block-title">CANCELED!

<p>Meanwhile, Zayday picked up #5 when she found out that Chamberlain was never actually employed by the hospital. The two of them were trying to connect the dots in order to find out if he could have been the baby from the Halloween party all those years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their suspicions hit a new high when they visited the nurse who is the mother, and got to see a picture of the father who looked a little too much like Chamberlain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Zayday confronted him, he confirmed he was never employed, but he liked looking after people and that the hospital was within walking distance to his home. He revealed he was upset with Zayday for trying to imply he was a bad person. This gave Zayday&nbsp;food for thought as she realized Chamberlain may be good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, #3, Brock and Cassidy contracted the Madonna Syndrome. This mysterious syndrome spread to them from a patient who couldn&#8217;t seem to keep the same accent. Brock&#8217;s cure for it was for all of them to watch American TV all weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munsch then confronted Dr. Hoffell about the way she was treating the Chanels and about her drug addiction. Munsch fired her, but Hoffell threatened to lift the lid about her terminal disease.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Don&#8217;t cross me slut, or I&#8217;ll make damn sure it&#8217;s the last thing you do,&quot; Hoffell barked.</p>
<p>The Chanels decided to throw a slumber party at the hospital to bait the new Chanels to the Green Meanie. They sent Chanel #8 to the morgue to get her gift, but #4 went after her because he wanted the choker. #8 left and #4 was murdered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hester then disappeared from the hospital, forcing Munsch to bring in some Chanels of her own. One of them was murdered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, it was revealed that Cascade is the kid from the hospital!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>If you thought the shocking character deaths were going to stop with Chad Radwell meeting his maker, then you were totally wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was Halloween in the hospital and Dean Munsch decided that it would be a good idea to have a party. That came from her wanting to unmask the killer in the wake of Chad being murdered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We picked up with Chanel as a broken woman. The man she loved and was set to marry had just been murdered. In typical Chanel fashion, she went to extremes, overreacting about how her life was over.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/season-2/halloween-blues/"></a></figure><figcaption>Watch Scream Queens Season 2 Episode 4 Online</figcaption>
<p>In actual fact, she never really loved Chad. What she loved was how well-known the Radwell name was and how much it would help her get to where she wanted in her career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chanel has become nothing more than a vile opportunist and it&#8217;s wearing a little thin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t change much for her when it was revealed the Radwell fortune was left to Dean Munsch. Yes, stupid Chad was given the whole fortune because his parents died on their private jet, while rushing to make sure Chad and Chanel did not get married.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the developments led to Chanel running across a table to attack the lawyer. It was a hilariously executed scene that proved Chanel could change things up if she wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munsch&nbsp;and Denise then went to meet up with Hester, to try and get some information on the killer. Hester revealed that they should throw a Halloween party to lure the killer out.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Hester also made a point of pleading with them to let her attend the party, but they laughed it off because of the safety concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Denise changed her tune when she was attacked by the killer, while setting up the hospital for the party. She got Hester an ankle bracelet and out of her cell for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Chanel argued with Dr. Holt about recent events and she said she was unwell, so he gave her silver corundum to try and make her better, but when she woke up she was blue all over.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chanel then went full steam ahead in her quest to make Holt look bad in front of Munsch, but she made it clear that Holt was having sex with her when Chad was murdered.</p>
<p>Chanel then stormed off after learning that someone stole another of her boyfriends. She was attacked by someone dressed as Ivana Trump and was quick to blame Chanel #5 for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5 did have a costume, but it was slightly different. The person in the other costume was revealed to be Hester. At the party, a group of teenagers appeared and they were all ill.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This forced the hospital into action to find a cure, but Chanel and Denise were nowhere to be found. They were busy contacting the spirit of Chad, who revealed that he and Denise had some really good times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scene was cut short when the hospital required them to return, as Zayday tried her best to get to the root of what was going on in the hospital. It turned out that the Green Meanie contaminated the dunking apple water and that&#8217;s why the teens were all ill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5 bumped into Hester, who got set to murder her, but the Green Meanie stabbed #5 in the back. This proved the two killers are working together and Hester knows more than she&#8217;s letting on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Denise appeared and tried to help #5, but she was forced to fight the Green Meanine once more. The murderer got the better of Denise and ended her life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means we&#8217;ve lost two main characters in just two weeks and another is hanging in the balance. What the heck is going on? The show is getting rid of the best characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/">watch Scream Queens online</a>, you&#8217;ll know that Chad and Denise make the show, so they will be sorely missed. Where do we go from here?</p>

<p>With the murders continuing at the hospital, the Chanels and&nbsp;Munsch&nbsp;thought it would be a good idea to visit Hester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you probably know if you <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scream-queens/full-episodes/">watch Scream Queens online</a>, Hester has some much needed intel on the new murderer who is stalking the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After some hilarious exchanges, Dean Munsch&nbsp;confirmed to Hester that she would be getting her a room with a view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Hester, it was in the form of an old VHS tape. Hester&#8217;s calm demeanor changed when Munsch confirmed the news that Chad knew who the murderer was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a parting gift, Hester revealed someone from Florida would be able to help them get closer to uncovering what the frack was going on at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That reveal came in the form of calling out Chanel for her dry skin. It was a subtle, but very effective hint. The Chanels, Zayday, Denise and Munsch took to Florida to meet up with Lynn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you care about the specifics, Munsch&nbsp;made it clear to the team that she was flying private, while the rest of them would need to fend for themselves on commercial class.</p>
<p>Lynn revealed that he became a millionaire for keeping quiet about the events of 1986. That explains why the Esrun cream business got a start.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Lynn made it clear to the women that he was being harassed my someone who threatened to murder him. This paved the way for some crazy theories between the women when they returned to the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chanel&#8217;s relationship with Chad went into overdrive when Chad realized he was about to lose Chanel to Holt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He opted to propose to Chanel to trap her with a huge diamond ring and an even bigger prenup that would secure his wealth when they inevitably broke up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing that made all of this crazy was that Chad had cold feet straight after. He desperately tried to prove that Holt was the killer, but Munsch came to the conclusion that Chad was the child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason that theory could work is that Denise revealed when she hit bone town with Chad, he came clean about the fact he was held back from school for eight years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would make Chad thirty-years-old!</p>
<p>There were bigger twists than that one peppered throughout this thrilling hour of the series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patient of the week was a woman who hit orgasms pretty much every few minutes. It cost her her everything and she was totally over it.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This served as a great opportunity for Chanel #3 and Cassidy Cascade to get closer than ever before. #3 revealed that she did not think orgasms were real and that she&#8217;s never had one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return, Cassidy revealed that he died several years ago after a frat party. It sounds completely ludicrous, but #3 struggled to get up close and personal with Cascade because he&#8217;s just too damn cold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She feels like she&#8217;s snuggling up to a snowman. Maybe there&#8217;s some truth to his story, but he&#8217;s totally sketchy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, #3 and Cassidy cured the woman, but there was no way in hell she was making it out of the hospital in one piece.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Chamberlain and Zayday were escorting the woman out of the hospital, the Green Meanie showed their knife throwing skills once more and beheaded the poor woman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chamberlain was injured, but was totally fine. The funny thing about all of it was that the killer flat out refused to harm Zayday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This made Zayday more intrigued than ever to get the truth about what was going on in the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, everyone had to attend Chanel and Chad&#8217;s wedding. Zayday and #3 were the bridesmaids, but poor #5 was relegated to the side as the ring bearer and forced to dress as a dog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will she ever catch a damn break?</p>
<p>Chad was a complete no show for his own wedding. It gave Chanel a flurry of emotions. It would be totally Chad if he done a runner, but he was actually dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Chad&#8217;s corpse came through the ceiling at the wedding and almost hit Chanel in all of its bloody glory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This puts to bed the theory that the Kappa Murders survivors are totally safe. Also, why did Chad have to die?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We probably have Hester to thank for that, or Dean Munsch. Revealing to Hester that Chad knew who the killer was probably foreshadowed his death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, Hester is in the hospital basement, but will she make it up the ranks to be in contact with the patients?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll need to tune in to find out.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The drama in the spooky hospital reached dizzying new heights on the latest episode of Scream Queens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started things off with Chanel #5 being blamed for the big murder at the close of the season premiere. It was a hilarious scene, but it was a little too obvious she would be blamed for the murder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being the only one who laid eyes on the killer is not the best defense and the police officer knew that. That probably explains why Munsch tried to discredit the officer&#8217;s credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chanel and Chanel #3 burst in to the crime scene and noted that #5 has started up the murders because she was jealous she never got invited on a date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the drama with the new murder sent Zayday&nbsp;on a mission to find out what Munsch&#8217;s true motives were. This was met with a less than stellar response from Chamberlain who informed her that she was playing with fire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He does have a point. Munsch was the one who took gave her a job when she really needed it. There&#8217;s nothing quite like biting the hand that feeds you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zayday&#8217;s investigation led to her finding out there was a Halloween party in 1986 and that every single person on the hospital staff was brutally murdered by the Green Meanie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that there would be no way in hell a hospital would open back up, but thanks to Munsch, the hospital&#8217;s sick past was concealed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zayday&nbsp;and Chamberlain then went full steam ahead to get the truth from Munsch, who burst out crying and let us in on a shock secret about about her true motives.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Munsch thinks she&#8217;s dying and has no idea what the heck her condition is. It makes sense, but she would have been better investing the money solely on research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There must be a lot of over head costs at the hospital. She did say she was funding it all on her own dime. Right?!</p>
<p>Zayday found out that Munsch had eaten a human corpse and she has a disease that cannibals get and gives her just one year to live. Yikes!</p>
<p>Ingrid is listening into the whole thing with a bug she placed under Munsch&#8217;s desk, but what the heck is she really up to?</p>
<p>Ingrid tried to get intel about the Chanel&#8217;s from Zayday, but she quickly knew what was going on and declined. It should be interesting to unravel how Ingrid is all over the place, trying to find out things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Chanel #5 got her start on the relationship ladder with Tyler, who had a disease that made him look like a monster.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>She made it her mission to find a way to cure him, but the Chanels ridiculed her every step of the way. She made a fundraising video to purchase a laser for the hospital, but it did not go down well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chad returned to the show in the most hilarious fashion. His friend had a bad case of stage fright, but Chad also had an ulterior motive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He wanted Chanel back as his girlfriend. There was a huge obstacle in the way and that was Dr. Holt. The two men sparred throughout the hour to get Chanel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to Holt&#8217;s hand writing a mysterious food order, Chad managed to find out that Holt&#8217;s transplanted hand came from a serial killer, who butchered close to 600 victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chad had the leverage he needed to get rid of Holt, but he did not quite go that far.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>When Munsch was attacked, she realized she would need to reel Denise in to get to the root of what was going on at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That paved the way for the Chanels, Munsch and Denise to visit Hester, who had some lofty demands to give them intel on the killer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious Hester is going to end up at the hospital, so the killings must get so frequent that they go through with getting her out of her asylum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We closed off this thrilling episode with Tyler being murdered by the killer. He had a nurse helping him to the punch.</p>
<p>Could the new killer be in #cahoots with Zayday?</p>
