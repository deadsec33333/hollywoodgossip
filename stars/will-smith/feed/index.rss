<p>Will Smith has spoken out about what&#8217;s become of his career.</p>



<p>Or, to be more specific, he has RAPPED about what&#8217;s become of his career.</p>



<p>As we&#8217;re sure you must recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/will-smith-speaks-about-oscar-slap-for-first-time-chris-rock-wont-talk-to-me/">Smith slapped Chris Rock</a> on stage at the Academy Awards in 2002&#8230; an incident that we still cannot believe actually took place.</p>



<p>The actor issued an apology and semi-explanation shortly afterward, but hasn&#8217;t said a lot in public since.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1000" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-1024x1000.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522369" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-1024x1000.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-300x293.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-768x750.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-2048x1999.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-960x937.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-1080x1054.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2155539049-1200x1172.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith poses during a photoshoot for the movie &#8216;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&#8217; at Angel de la Independencia on May 31, 2024 in Mexico City, Mexico. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Hector Vivas/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On March 28, however, Smith released a new album titled &#8220;Based on a True Story.&#8221; </p>



<p>The first first track is titled “Int. Barbershop — Day,&#8221; and it opens with the phrase: <em><strong>Will Smith is canceled</strong></em>.</p>



<p>The single &#8212; which features Smith’s Fresh Prince collaborator DJ Jazzy Jeff and B. Simone &#8212; features differently-pitched voices discussing rumors and opinions about the actor and rapper in a freestyle manner.</p>



<p>“Who the f-ck Will Smith think he is?” one voice asks, to which another replies: “I ain’t never going to forgive him for that s-it he did.”</p>

<p>As a refresher&#8230; Rock served as host of the 2022 Oscars when he made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. </p>



<p>Smith reacted by walking up on stage and striking Rock across the face. </p>



<p>When the actor returned to his seat, he screamed: “Keep my wife’s name out of your f-cking mouth!” </p>



<p>Later on in the ceremony, Smith returned to the stage to accept the Oscar for best actor for his performance in “King Richard.” It was wild, guys.</p>



<p>On this new album, meanwhile, Smith addresses the scandal directly with the lyrics: </p>



<p>“I heard he won the Oscar but he had to give it back/ And you know they only made him do that shit because he’s Black.” </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Will Smith slaps Chris Rock at the Oscars in 2022." class="wp-image-502646" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith slaps US actor Chris Rock onstage during the 94th Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California on March 27, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear and accurate, Smith did NOT have to return his Oscar.</p>



<p>Instead, the Academy banned him from attending any event related to the organization for 10 years. </p>



<p>Smith also resigned his Academy membership <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/will-smith-speaks-about-oscar-slap-for-first-time-chris-rock-wont-talk-to-me/">and issued an apology</a>, saying that he was “deeply remorseful” for his actions.</p>



<p>This is the first time Smith has tried to claim that the color of his skin had anything to do with his punishment.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="698" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-1024x698.jpg" alt="Will Smith in February of 2015." class="wp-image-502649" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-768x523.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-2048x1396.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-960x654.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-1080x736.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_05-1200x818.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith attends the Warner Bros. Pictures&#8217; &#8220;Focus&#8221; premiere at TCL Chinese Theatre on February 24, 2015.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The aforementioned single later references Smith’s infamous response to Rock’s joke with the line: “Him and Jada both crazy girl, what you talkin’ bout?/ You better keep his wife’s name out of your mouth.”</p>



<p>Elsewhere, on the track “You Lookin’ for Me?,&#8221; Smith also hints at the controversy, rapping: </p>



<p>“Took a lot, I’m back on top/ Y’all gon’ have to get acclimated/ Won’t stop, my shit still hot/ Even though I won’t get nominated.” </p>



<p>To again be clear and accurate, Smith’s ban from Academy events does NOT impact his eligibility for future Oscar nominations.</p>

<p>The last time we wrote about Will Smith, he was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/will-smith-nearly-kisses-india-martinez-calls-marriage-into-question-again/">nearly kissing another woman on stage</a>.</p>



<p>On the professional front, “Based on a True Story” marks Smith’s first full-length solo music project in 20 years, with his previous release being 2005’s “Lost and Found.”</p>



<p>Last summer, he co-starred with Martin Lawrence in “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” which garnered more than $400 million worldwide.</p>

<p>First, it was the Slap Heard &#8216;Round the World.</p>



<p>Now, it&#8217;s the near-kiss.</p>



<p>As you very likely know at this point, Will Smith has scarcely been heard from over the past three years. Ever since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/will-smith-still-hates-chris-rock/">he whacked Chris Rock</a> on stage at the Academy Awards.</p>



<p>Now, however, the actor has returned to the spotlight &#8212; once again, though, for a reason that has raised eyebrows across the Internet.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520210" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1445900188-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith attend Apple Original Films&#8217; &#8220;Emancipation&#8221;  Los Angeles premiere at Regency Village Theatre on November 30, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last week, you see, Smith and India Martinez performed the single &#8220;First Love&#8221; during Univision&#8217;s 37th Premio Lo Nuestro Awards at Miami&#8217;s Kaseya Center.</p>



<p>In Instagram footage that was later uploaded by Martinez and which has since spread like wild and dangerous fire, the artists get very close, comfortable and steamy together on stage.</p>



<p>They lean their heads close to one another and get as close as humanly possible to making out as two people possibly can. Without actually should so, we should note.</p>



<p>Martinez captioned the video as follows: “I want that first passion. I want them first hugs. I want them hard cries. I want that FIRST LOVE.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smith, of course, is married to actress Jada Pinkett Smith.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been talk, though, that the spouses <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/will-smith-responds-did-he-really-sleep-with-duane-martin/">are in an open marriage</a>&#8230; or at least an unconventional marriage.</p>



<p>Jada, for example, previously told <em>Today</em> Show host Hoda Kotb that the pair effectively split up in 2016, saying on air: &#8220;It was not a divorce on paper, but it <em>was</em> a divorce&#8230;</p>



<p>“I think by the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying,” Jada expressed. “I think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be.</p>



<p>&#8220;I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through whatever. And I just haven’t been able to break that promise.”</p>

<p>Jada also admitted in 2020 that she had a romantic &#8220;entanglement&#8221; with singer August Alsina.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth remember, as we try to figure <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/will-smith-divorce-jada-pinkett-smith/">Will and Jada&#8217;s marriage out</a>, that Smith smacked Rock at the aforementioned Oscars because the comedian made a joke at Jada&#8217;s expense.</p>



<p>Last month, meanwhile, a source told People Magazine the couple is &#8220;still together&#8221; despite having &#8220;separate homes for years.&#8221; </p>



<p>Another insider explained they were &#8220;living their own lives&#8221; but hadn&#8217;t &#8220;completely severed ties.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this union is none of our business and we&#8217;ll likely never understand the way it works.</p>



<p>But if Smith is trying to salvage his reputation, practically swapping spit with another woman in public likely isn&#8217;t the way to get it done.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was waiting for Jada to come out from left stage and smack the s&#8212; outta her for kissing her man,&#8221; wrote one Instagram user in the video&#8217;s comments section.</p>



<p>&#8220;Will Smith gives off really creepy old man vibes in this clip. Cringe,” another comment reads.</p>



<p>A third tried to play peacemaker and attempted to be the voice of reason, stating in response:</p>



<p>&#8220;The way y&#8217;all talk about these people relationship as though you personally know them is wild.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Smith wants to make one thing perfectly clear:</p>



<p>He has zero involvement in the never-ending <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-accuser-says-mogul-raped-her-as-revenge-for-tupac-murder-accusation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations surrounding Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs</a>.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is currently behind bars</a> awaiting trial on a whole slew of charges, many of which stem from rape and sexual assault allegations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-scandal">A Growing Scandal</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/jay-z-accused-of-teaming-with-diddy-to-rape-13-year-old-rapper-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Z became embroiled in the scandal</a>, as an anonymous accuser alleged that the hip hop legend raped her alongside Diddy.</p>



<p>She was just 13 at the time of the alleged incident, which she claims took place in 2000.</p>



<p>Perhaps seeking to preemptively avoid any legal drama of his own, Will disavowed any connection with Diddy during a concert in San Diego Thursday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="728" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-496584746-1-1024x728.jpg" alt="Will Smith attends the Centerpiece Gala Premiere of Columbia Pictures' &quot;Concussion&quot; during AFI FEST 2015 presented by Audi at TCL Chinese Theatre on November 10, 2015 in Hollywood, California.

<p>“The world we’re in right now is really hard for y’all to discern what’s real and what’s true,” Will told the crowd, in footage obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/13/will-smith-says-nothing-to-do-with-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>. </p>



<p>“I haven’t addressed any of this publicly, but I just wanted to say this very clearly: I don’t have s&#8211;t to do with Puffy, so y’all can stop all the memes.”</p>



<p>Will didn&#8217;t go into specifics with regard to the memes, but it seems he&#8217;s upset by some content that he&#8217;s seen circulating on social media.</p>

<p>“You can stop all that bulls&#8211;t I ain’t been nowhere near those damn Freak-Offs. I do enough of my own s&#8211;t, don’t be putting other people’s bulls&#8211;t,&#8221; he continued, referring to Diddy&#8217;s infamous sex parties.</p>



<p>&#8220;I ain’t been anywhere near that man [or] did none of that stupid s&#8211;t, so whenever you guys hear that, it’s a damn lie.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, Will was quite adamant about his lack of any connection to Diddy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1024x683.jpg" alt="Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures' premiere of &quot;Gemini Man&quot; on October 06, 2019 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-515195" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures&#8217; premiere of &#8220;Gemini Man&#8221; on October 06, 2019 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But he also kept things somewhat light, joking that he “doesn’t even like baby oil.” Clearly, Will does not want to wind up answering any Diddy-related questions, as Jay Z might soon find himself doing</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-diddy">What&#8217;s Next For Diddy?</h2>



<p>As for the man at the center of all of this, it&#8217;s looking more and more like he might remain locked for a very long time.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the jailed hip hop mogul continue to maintain his innocence.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ll get the chance to make their case in court when Diddy&#8217;s trial gets underway in May.</p>



<p>But however the trial unfolds, we think it&#8217;s safe to say that the court of public opinion has already reached its verdict.</p>

<p>Are Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith divorced for real?</p>



<p>Longtime fans of the celebrity pair have expressed confusion over their complex relationship. Things have intensified since the couple has been out of the spotlight for over a year.</p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/will-smith-family-photo-jada-pinkett-smith-easter-sunday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith and his family</a> are Hollywood royalty. But are he and Jada still family?</p>



<p>What is the actual status of his marriage to Jada? Here, we break down the rumors and the truth</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="774" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-1024x774.jpg" alt="Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith in March of 2022." class="wp-image-501068" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-1024x774.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-300x227.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-768x580.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-2048x1547.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-960x725.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-1080x816.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_willsmith_jadapinkettsmith_01-1200x907.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith attend the 94th Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood and Highland on March 27, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-smith-amp-jada-pinkett-smith-are-they-still-married">Will Smith &amp; Jada Pinkett Smith: Are They Still married?</h2>



<p>In the time since Will famously slapped Chris Rock across the face at the Oscars, he and wife Jada Pinkett Smith have kept a low profile. </p>



<p>That all changed in late 2023, when Jada set out on her press tour to talk about her memoir, <em>Worthy</em>.</p>



<p>Naturally, the press was interested in Jada&#8217;s marriage and how things were going with Will after nearly 30 years together.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when she dropped the bombshell: Jada and Will were no longer together. </p>



<p>According to Jada, the couple had been secretly but effectively separated since 2016. At the time, that meant seven years of leading their own lives while masquerading as a still-committed couple.</p>



<p>However, legally speaking, the couple are still together. They are not, effectively, divorced. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="EXCLUSIVE: Jada Pinkett Smith reveals she and Will Smith have been separated since 2016" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4O8qJNQurQ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it was not a divorce on paper, but it was a divorce,&#8221; Jada told <em>Today</em> Show host Hoda Kotb.</p>



<p>She then touched upon rumors that had circulated about the couple. Some wild claims included whispers that the two were <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/will-smith-responds-did-he-really-sleep-with-duane-martin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a lavender marriage</a>, or that they were swingers.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can definitely understand why there would be misunderstandings,&#8221; Jada diplomatically acknowledged. &#8220;But none of it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>



<p>But what is true is, when Will Smith shouted at Chris Rock to keep his &#8220;wife&#8217;s name&#8221; out of his mouth, Jada had not been Will&#8217;s wife for quite a bit of time. </p>

<p>Naturally, most people with the financial means to move on might find it easier to split than to pretend that their relationship remains unchanged.</p>



<p>So, why take the step of separating and not just pull the trigger on a divorce? Seven years is a long time to just be separated. But Jada insisted it was more complicated that that. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think just not being ready yet,&#8221; Jada reasoned. &#8220;Still trying to figure out between the two of us how to be in a partnership.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;And in regards to how do we present that to people, you know? And we hadn&#8217;t figured that out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think by the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying,&#8221; Jada expressed. &#8220;I think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be.&#8221; </p>



<p>She admitted: &#8220;I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through whatever. And I just haven&#8217;t been able to break that promise.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smiths-holy-slap-saved-our-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When it comes to divorcing now</a>, even when this is no longer a secret, Jada emphasized: &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to. We love our family. And we love each other. It&#8217;s more of a life partnership. Ten years from now, Hoda, who knows?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-smith-breaks-his-silence-on-split-from-jada">Will Smith Breaks His Silence On Split From Jada</h2>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/14/arts/jada-pinkett-smith-worthy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith told</a> <em>The New York Times</em> that his wife&#8217;s open and honest discussion of matters of the head and heart were inspirational to him. </p>



<p>&#8220;When you’ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in,&#8221; he characterized.</p>



<p>Will acknowledged: &#8220;You can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties.&#8221;</p>



<p>A year later, while sitting down for an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u3zCZW6v4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">306 with Speedy,</a> Will admitted that more revelations about his marriage would likely be discussed in the future, though maybe in less of a bombshell ways as before.</p>



<p>“I’m gonna do it more artfully this year,&#8221; Will explained in March 2024. &#8220;I’m certainly going to be a little more delicate with it, but to me, the process of evolving and elevating and learning how to love, and learning how to share, and learning how to interact — that’s what we’re all doing&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-smith-is-a-divorced-man-how-his-first-marriage-ended">Will Smith Is A Divorced Man: How His First Marriage Ended </h2>



<p>In May of 1992, Will and Sheree married. They welcomed their son, Trey, in November of that year.</p>



<p>The married did not last. In 1995, the couple divorced &#8212; a painful decision that continues to haunt Will Smith, as he memorably told Jada on <em>Red Table Talk</em> in 2020.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">&#8220;Divorce was the worst thing in my adult life, divorce was the ultimate failure for me,&#8221; Will Smith expressed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been hurt a lot in my adult life, but I don&#8217;t think anything touches the failure of getting divorced from my 2-year-old son&#8217;s mother.&#8221;</p>



<p>Both Will and Sheree moved on. Will married Jada in 1996. Sheree married Terrell Fletcher in 2007, though the two would divorce in 2014.</p>



<p>Many people know Sheree best from<em> The Real Housewives</em>. She joined <em>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</em> in 2002, both as a successful businesswoman and as a famous Hollywood ex.</p>



<p>Sheree and Will have managed to act as co-parents for Trey, even as exes. This has continued into Trey&#8217;s adulthood. Loving family units come in many shapes and sizes, and exes can still be family.</p>

<p>As we&#8217;ve mentioned, for the most part, the couple have kept a low profile.</p>



<p>Having said that, the man still has to go to work!</p>



<p>On May 30, 2024, Will Smith made a public appearance with his family for the <em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em> premiere. That <em>includes </em>still-wife Jada Pinkett Smith.</p>



<p>His son Trey, whom he shares with ex-wife Sheree Zampino, was there. So were son Jaden and daughter Willow, whom he shares with Jada. Jada&#8217;s mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, was also present.</p>



<p>Will Smith and Jada are not divorced. But it&#8217;s clear that neither of them know exactly what the future holds for their family. They&#8217;re doing what works, for as long as it works.</p>

<p>Did Chris Rock ever sue Will Smith?</p>



<p>Will Smith is set to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/will-smith-bet-awards-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform a new song at the 2024 BET Awards</a>. His years-long<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/will-smith-oscars-attending-academy-awards-chris-rock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ban from attending the Oscars</a> does not extend to other events, obviously.</p>



<p>But, more than two years after the infamous and polarizing &#8220;slap&#8221; incident &#8230; what was the closure, there?</p>



<p>American society has a reputation for being litigious. Did Chris Rock end up taking Will Smith to court over the slap heard round the world?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-infamous-will-smith-vs-chris-rock-oscars-slap-revisited">The Infamous Will Smith vs Chris Rock Oscars Slap Revisited</h2>



<p>In March of 2022, Chris Rock stood on the stage at the Oscars.</p>



<p>Hosting the Oscars is not exactly an enviable gig. Some do better than others, but it&#8217;s a thankless job that can ruffle (powerful) feathers and risks hurting a comedian&#8217;s brand with viewers.</p>



<p>Oscars hosting is not usually a contact sport. Chris Rock is not the first to cross the line when poking fun at a famous guest, but no one has forgotten the clapback.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-1024x680.jpg" alt="Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith in early March of 2022." class="wp-image-502713" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-960x638.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-1080x718.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_willsmith_01-1200x797.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith attend the 27th Annual Critics Choice Awards at Fairmont Century Plaza on March 13, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Alberto E.

<p>As for what happened, Chris cracked jokes about Jada&#8217;s hair. She has alopecia, and he opted to joke about her shaved head.</p>



<p>Many on social media have since pointed out that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/its-not-jada-pinkett-smiths-fault-that-chris-rock-is-so-obsessed-with-her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Rock&#8217;s apparent obsession with Jada</a> goes back decades. TBH &#8211; It&#8217;s weird.</p>



<p>However, Will Smith&#8217;s response was not a stern look or social media condemnation. He took a few long strides onto the stage and smacked Chris Rock on the face. Returning to his seat, he advised the host to keep Jada&#8217;s name out of his mouth.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Rock on the Oscars stage in 2022." class="wp-image-502710" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Rock onstage during the 94th Oscars after being slapped in the face by Will Smith. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-chris-rock-respond">How did Chris Rock respond?</h2>



<p>Infamously, the slap was extremely polarizing on social media.</p>



<p>Some people were in hysterics, acting as if Will Smith were a monster &#8212; some even comparing this to domestic violence. (Chris Rock is not Smith&#8217;s child, partner, or other family member &#8230; in case anyone was wondering)</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another faction acted as if this were no big deal. Obviously, that&#8217;s not the case. In general, hitting someone in the face is assault. No matter the possible provocation, it&#8217;s never <em>nothing</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>On stage, Chris Rock himself largely kept his composure &#8212; largely, at first, out of shock.</p>



<p>Will Smith issued apologies. First, to everyone in general (during his Oscar acceptance speech). Then, the next day, he used social media to apologize directly to Chris.</p>



<p>He also received a decade-long ban from attending the Academy Awards. Still, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smiths-holy-slap-saved-our-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some good came from it</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Rock at the Oscars in March of 2022." class="wp-image-502712" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0625_chrisrock_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this handout photo provided by A.M.P.A.S.,  Chris Rock is seen backstage during the 94th Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 27, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Al Seib /A.M.P.A.S. via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-did-chris-rock-sue-will-smith">But did Chris Rock sue Will Smith?</h2>



<p>But now to the question and answer: No, Chris Rock did not sue Will Smith following the 2022 Oscars slap.</p>



<p>That must have been a complex decision.</p>



<p>It could have arguably hurt his brand. Society as a whole and especially fans can be weird about lawsuits &#8212; the justified ones and the totally unjustified alike.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Chris Rock Live Stand-Up | Date Announcement | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eve1ozpvaxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Arguably, Chris did end up getting the last laugh. Netflix <a href="https://memeburn.com/2023/03/netflix-how-chris-rock-got-the-40m-last-laugh-over-will-smiths-slap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly offered him $40 million</a> for a standup special. (That&#8217;s a believable report; Netflix&#8217;s financial choices are <em>fascinating</em>) During <em>Selective Outrage</em>, which aired a year after the Oscars incident, he repeatedly brought up Will Smith.</p>



<p>&#8220;People are like, &#8216;Did it hurt?&#8217; It still hurts. I&#8217;ve got [Will&#8217;s song] &#8216;Summertime&#8217; ringing in my ears,&#8221; Chris joked. But I&#8217;m not a victim, baby, you will never see me on Oprah <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/gayle-king-sports-illustrated-swimsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or Gayle</a> crying. &#8230; I took that hit like Pacquiao.&#8221;</p>



<p>He further explained: &#8220;A lot of people say, Chris, why did you do nothing back? How come you didn&#8217;t do nothing back? Because I got parents, that&#8217;s why. Because I was raised. I got parents, and you know what my parents taught me? Don’t fight in front of white people.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to Will Smith debuting a new song on Sunday, June 30, many other talented entertainers will take the stage for Culture&#8217;s Biggest Night.</p>



<p>That includes Ms. Lauryn Hill &amp; YG Marley, Tyla, and of course <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/ice-spice-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the beautiful Ice Spice</a> as performers.</p>



<p>GloRilla, Latto, Muni Long, Sexyy Red, Shaboozey, Victoria Monet, and Tanner Adell will also perform. And Taraji P. Henson will be hosting the event for the third time. Good for her!</p>

<p>Well, the song may slap &#8230; we don&#8217;t know yet. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/will-smith-oscars-attending-academy-awards-chris-rock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith won&#8217;t be attending the Oscars</a> any time soon, but other venues are much more respective.</p>



<p>Most people these days just know Will Smith for making movies and attractive, talented children. But he is also a musician of <em>historic </em>importance &#8212; his rap was <em>the </em>first to win a Grammy.</p>



<p>And, at the 2024 BET Awards, he&#8217;s going to perform a new, original song.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-2024-bet-awards-will-be-will-smith-s-first-major-solo-performance-since-you-know">The 2024 BET Awards will be Will Smith&#8217;s first major solo performance since, you know</h2>



<p>On Sunday, June 30, Will Smith will unveil and perform his new, original song at the BET Awards.</p>



<p>That would be exciting news on its own. After all, his music is legendary and helped to catapult him into his spectacular acting career.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t actually know what Smith will be performing. His most recent performance was a cameo with J Balvin <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/coachella-surprise-guests-2024-weekend-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Coachella</a> back in April. And that was a <em>Men In Black</em> reference.</p>

<p>Connie Orlando, EVP of Specials, Music Programing, &amp; Music Strategy at BET <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/will-smith-to-perform-new-song-bet-awards-1236045275/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to</a> <em>Variety </em>about inviting Will Smith to perform.</p>



<p>“From his start as a rapper to &#8216;The Fresh Prince&#8217; to being a box office king as one of the Bad Boys, Will Smith is truly a global icon, and we are honored to welcome him back to grace the BET Awards stage,&#8221; Orlando affirmed.</p>



<p>Orlando then expressed: “We look forward to Will adding to yet another defining night for the culture that is not to be missed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obviously-will-smith-appearing-at-an-award-show-is-a-touchy-topic">Obviously, Will Smith appearing at an award show is a touchy topic</h2>



<p>At the 2022 Oscars, the A-list actor marched up onto the stage and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/will-smith-smacks-chris-rock-in-most-shocking-oscars-moment-of-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smacked Chris Rock</a>.</p>



<p>This was not a scripted action. And it was also not spontaneous or out-of-the-blue. Chris Rock had, and not for the first time, seemed to show an apparent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/its-not-jada-pinkett-smiths-fault-that-chris-rock-is-so-obsessed-with-her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unhealthy obsession with Jada Pinkett Smith</a>. This time, poking fun at her hair loss.</p>



<p>The reactions were divided. And despite the polarization, many people&#8217;s responses seemed (perhaps due to the nature of social media) so extreme that they were unreasonable.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Will Smith in October of 2019." class="wp-image-502647" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_willsmith_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures&#8217; premiere of &#8220;Gemini Man&#8221; on October 06, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One camp was likening the infamous slap to <em>evils </em>like domestic violence, or suggesting that this was akin to random violence against comedians.</p>



<p>The other suggested that Smith had done nothing wrong, that the incident was so mild that it was not worth commentary.</p>



<p>Obviously, Smith and Rock are not family or in a relationship. They are also not strangers. These were two extremely famous millionaire adults who have known each other for decades. But, let&#8217;s be clear: hitting someone in the face is assault. <em>Even </em>with possible verbal provocation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-a-career-comeback">Is this a career comeback?</h2>



<p>Well &#8230; no. This is not a comeback because his career is doing just fine.</p>



<p>The same month as the BET Awards, <em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em> released in theaters and raked in 9 figures at the box office. Yes, that&#8217;s the film where <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/will-smith-slapped-on-screen-returns-to-box-office-dominance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith gets slapped on screen</a>.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s not allowed at the Oscars for years to come. But that won&#8217;t stop Smith from making extremely successful films &#8212; or music. Or from attending other awards shows. Shows where, one might hope, people will keep his wife&#8217;s name out of their mouths.</p>

<p>Will Smith is back from the dead.</p>



<p>Or, at least, back from wherever one goes after one slaps the host of the Academy Awards on stage in front of millions of viewers because said host made a pretty basic joke about his wife.</p>



<p>This is a long and confusing way of stating the following:</p>



<p><strong>Bad Boys: Ride or Die earned $104.6 million globally this weekend after being released on Friday.</strong></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-1024x577.webp" alt="Bad Boys Ride or Die photo" class="wp-image-501561" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-1024x577.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-768x433.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-960x541.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024-1200x676.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/DF-23377_r-H-2024.webp 1296w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in Bad Boys Ride or Die.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (FRANK MASI/SONY PICTURES)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The impressive figure came as a surprise to some because Smith has been out of the spotlight for years, really.</p>



<p>As cited above, he made the shocking decision in March 2022 to confront Chris Rock at the Oscars after Rock made a quip about Jada Pinkett&#8217;s bald head&#8230; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/will-smith-smacks-chris-rock-in-most-shocking-oscars-moment-of-a/">smacking Rock in the face at the time</a>.</p>



<p>We truly still can&#8217;t believe this happened.</p>



<p>At one point in Bad Boys 4, Smith&#8217;s character gets slapped in the face repeatedly by Martin Lawrence&#8217;s character in a scene that we&#8217;d have to imagine was included purposely as some kind of nod to Smith&#8217;s bizarre behavior back then.</p>



<p>“The scene acts as a kind of pop exorcism,” critic Owen Gleiberman wrote in Entertainment Weekly, explaining in his review: </p>



<p>“It’s ‘punishing’ Smith, making cruel fun of his transgression, and just maybe, in the process, allowing him to crawl out from under the image of it.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-1024x683.jpg" alt="Will Smith with the press" class="wp-image-501563" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155076389-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martin Lawrence and Will Smith pose during the red carpet for the movie &#8216;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&#8217; at Cinepolis Parque Toreo on June 1, 2024 in Naucalpan de Juarez, Mexico.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Angel Delgado/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Smith, of course, was one of the most popular celebrities alive pre-slap.</p>



<p>But he was criticized sharply for basically assaulting Rock in the aforementioned manner, while folks were then left to also analyze his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/will-smith-divorced-jada-pinkett-smith/">unusual marriage to Pinkett Smith</a>.</p>



<p>The spouses appear to be together, but have also hinted in the past that they have an open marriage.</p>



<p>Not that we&#8217;re judging. Whatever works, you know?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-1024x683.jpg" alt="Martin Lawrence and Will Smith pose" class="wp-image-501565" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155539026-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Martin Lawrence and Will Smith pose during a photoshoot for the movie &#8216;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&#8217; at Angel de la Independencia on May 31, 2024 in Mexico City, Mexico.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Hector Vivas/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For Smith, going back to a franchise such as Bad Boys in order to return to big screen prominence has clearly worked out.</p>



<p>In a six-minute video posted to his Instagram and YouTube accounts about two years ago, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/will-smith-speaks-about-oscar-slap-for-first-time-chris-rock-wont-talk-to-me/">Smith addressed the Rock slap</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will say to you Chris, I apologize to you. My behavior was unacceptable and I’m here whenever you are ready to talk,&#8221; the actor said, talking to the comedian directly and later adding:</p>



<p>“I’m not going to try to unpack all of that right now, but I can say to all of you, there is no part of me that thinks that was the right way to behave in that moment,” Smith said.</p>



<p>“There’s no part of me that thinks that is the optimal way to handle a feeling of disrespect or insults&#8230;</p>



<p>“I know it was shocking, but I promise you I am deeply devoted and committed to putting light and love and joy into the world, and you know, if you hang on, I promise we’ll be able to be friends again.”</p>

<p>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith are all smiles in their latest family photo.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/will-smith-oscars-attending-academy-awards-chris-rock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith did not (and could not) attend the 2024 Oscars</a>, the echoes of his 2022 attendance still ring in people&#8217;s ears.</p>



<p>That same Oscars stage controversy helped <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smiths-holy-slap-saved-our-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save Will and Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s marriage</a>.</p>



<p>Even so, each new revelation about the A-list couple has people wondering where things stand.</p>

<p>Will Smith himself is, of course, in the foreground. But this is a group selfie, and he&#8217;s far from alone.</p>



<p>Behind him, we see his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Jaden, his 25-year-old son, and Willow, his 23-year-old daughter, are both there. Jada&#8217;s mom, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, is also there &#8212; though you&#8217;d be forgiven for mistaking her for Jada&#8217;s sister.</p>



<p>Will&#8217;s mother, Caroline Bright, is present and accounted for. So is his brother, Harry, and Will&#8217;s other son, 31-year-old Trey. Trey is Will&#8217;s son with ex, Sheree Zampino.</p>

<p>The photo of the family together is refreshing, given that most fans are confused on where Will and Jada stand these days. </p>

<p>“We’re staying together forever,” Jada affirmed. “I think that one of those next stages in relationships is when you really learn how to accept yourself fully, you really learn how to accept your partner fully as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jada went on to characterize her experiences: “That’s been a journey all in itself.”</p>

<p>Jada also explained at that time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/will-smith-smacks-chris-rock-in-most-shocking-oscars-moment-of-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith&#8217;s infamous slap</a> at the 2022 Academy Awards had done good things for her marriage. He was, after all, acting in her defense.</p>



<p>“You learn how to accept everyone else even when you’re dealing with their shadow,” Jada reasoned. “You just learn how to embrace the light of people as well as the shadow.&#8221;</p>



<p>She affirmed: &#8220;I love Will as who he is. I’ve learned to love and embrace Chris as who he is. And myself as well. And that’s what it’s about. We’re all here just trying to figure it out.”</p>

<p>In light of all of the couple&#8217;s (mostly) quiet ups-and-downs, a lot of Will and Jada&#8217;s longtime fans have felt curious about where things stand. So Will and Jada appearing together in this family photo is great news.</p>



<p>Clearly, they&#8217;re still enjoying each other&#8217;s company and bringing the entire family together for holidays. </p>



<p>Marriage can take so many forms. What works for some people might not work for Will and Jada. </p>

<p>Is Will Smith allowed to attend the Oscars this year?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, but it was back in 2022 when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/will-smith-smacks-chris-rock-in-most-shocking-oscars-moment-of-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith smacked Chris Rock at the Oscars</a>. It was a shocker &#8212; and a divisive moment when it come to how people reacted on social media.</p>



<p>The frenzy of extremely polarized takes has had plenty of time to cool off since then.</p>



<p>The question is &#8230; will Will Smith attend this year&#8217;s Oscars? Did the Academy even invite him?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-will-smith-attend-to-oscars-this-year">Can Will Smith attend to Oscars this year?</h2>



<p>On April 8, 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) made a determination. AMPAS banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars for ten years, and also included all other Academy events.</p>



<p>This means that he will not be a presenter, will not be an invited guest, and cannot be a plus one. Peculiarly, he cannot even attend these events virtually &#8212; making it feel less like an excessive safety precaution and more like a shunning.</p>



<p>Will Smith publicly accepted the Academy&#8217;s decision. So it&#8217;s (obviously) unlikely that he&#8217;s going to attempt to &#8220;crash&#8221; one of these events.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-will-smith-receive-a-10-year-ban-from-the-oscars">Why did Will Smith receive a 10-year ban from the Oscars?</h2>



<p>The short answer is that Will Smith smacked Chris Rock in the face when Rock was giving the Best Documentary Feature presentation in 2022. The full answer requires some background.</p>



<p>Will Smith and Chris Rock have known each other for decades. They have both known Jada Pinkett Smith, Will&#8217;s wife, for decades.</p>



<p>And historically, Chris Rock has seemed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/its-not-jada-pinkett-smiths-fault-that-chris-rock-is-so-obsessed-with-her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obsessed with Jada</a>, making odd  jabs at her. On March 27, 2022, he used the Oscars stage to crack a joke about Jada&#8217;s shaved head.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-same-night-will-smith-actually-won-an-oscar">That same night, Will Smith actually won an Oscar</h2>



<p>Will Smith ended up taking home <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/2022-oscar-winners-they-actually-handed-out-some-awards-on-slap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Best Actor </a>award, which happened <em>after </em>the infamous slap. </p>



<p>At the time, he apologized to the Academy and to the other nominees who were present. It was only the next day when he took to social media and apologized to Chris Rock.</p>



<p>Will Smith also resigned his AMPAS membership days after the incident. Amidst some intense and at time disproportional backlash, he was facing potential suspension or expulsion. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-can-will-smith-attend-the-oscars-again">When can Will Smith attend the Oscars again?</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the famous actor received a 10-year ban from all Academy events, including (and especially) the Oscars.</p>



<p>Given the wording and timing of AMPAS&#8217; decision, he will only be able to attend such events again starting on April 8, 2032.</p>



<p>Unless the Academy Awards happen after that date that year, he&#8217;ll be able to attend the Oscars in 2033.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-was-jada-pinkett-smith-s-role-in-all-of-this">What was Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s role in all of this?</h2>



<p>Some social media malefactors hoped to &#8220;blame&#8221; Jada for the entire event. Why? Because misogyny rots your brain.</p>



<p>Her only role in this was being a witness, being <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smiths-holy-slap-saved-our-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Smith&#8217;s wife</a>, and being the target of yet another unkind joke from Chris Rock.</p>



<p>Notably, on a 2018 Red Table Talk episode, Jada had opened up about her alopecia areata. The reason for her shaving her head was not a secret, and the joke was in decidedly poor taste.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="696" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-1024x696.jpg" alt="Will Smith in March of 2022." class="wp-image-495243" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-1024x696.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-768x522.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-1536x1045.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-2048x1393.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-735x500.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-335x228.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-347x236.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-520x354.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-640x435.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-960x653.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0308_willsmith_05-1080x734.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith attends the 94th Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood and Highland on March 27, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ultimately, the incident was extremely polarizing because it is also more complex than either side would like to acknowledge. People suggesting that it was unremarkable were mistaken, just as the people who (tastelessly) compared the incident to domestic violence.</p>



<p>On the one hand, what we saw were two adult men, both world-famous millionaires, who have known each other for decades. One has made repeated digs about the other&#8217;s wife, and the other responded with a slap.</p>



<p>But on the other hand, the Oscars is more or less a &#8220;work event.&#8221; Not only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/chris-rock-will-he-press-charges-against-will-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was it a crime</a> (yes, assault is a crime), but one can understand <em>some </em>reaction by AMPAS &#8212; just as management would have to respond if one office coworker smacked another at a retirement party.</p>

<p>In early spring of 2022, a lot of people lost their collective minds over the Oscars.</p>



<p>After Chris Rock&#8217;s jabs about Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith jogged up to the stage and slapped him.</p>



<p>In the aftermath, people simply refused to be normal about it. The world also learned a lot about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/jada-pinkett-smith-will-and-i-have-been-separated-for-seven-years/">Will and Jada&#8217;s troubled marriage</a>.</p>



<p>But Jada recently shared something else. That infamous slap? It may have saved their marriage.</p>

<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-12827701/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-reveals-shell-never-leave-Smith-separate-homes-Oscars-slap-saved-marriage.html">with <em>The Daily Mail</em></a>, Jada Pinkett Smith shared how Will Smith&#8217;s ardent defense of her at the 2022 Academy Awards helped clarify a lot of things for her.</p>



<p>She knew in that moment that she and Will would, and should, always be together.</p>



<p>“After all those years trying to figure out if I would leave Will’s side,&#8221; Jada said. &#8220;It took that slap for me to see I will never leave him.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Who knows where our relationship would be if that hadn’t happened?” Jada then asked.</p>



<p>Back in October, she shared that she and Will had actually separated &#8212; quietly, secretly &#8212; seven years ago.</p>



<p>According to her, they had become &#8220;exhausted with trying&#8221; to make their marriage work. This was after nearly two decades of marriage, by the way. No small feat.</p>

<p>At the time, Jada had emphasized that, &#8220;on paper,&#8221; she and Will were still married. There was no secret divorce filing or anything of the sort.</p>



<p>However, in their minds, they were no longer a couple. They were exes who respected each other and co-parented their amazing children.</p>



<p>In public, of course, they continued to present themselves as one of Hollywood&#8217;s most doting couples. They&#8217;d had decades of practice, after all.</p>

<p>As you may recall, Chris Rock decided to make jokes at the Oscars about Jada&#8217;s closely shaved head.</p>



<p>Jada has alopecia. Additionally, the comedian has a reputation for having some sort of fixation about her. It&#8217;s unsettling.</p>



<p>That was why Will strode up to the stage and slapped Chris. The exchange between the two incredibly wealthy men was a scandal &#8230; justifiably, but many blew it out of proportion.</p>

<p>“I call it the ‘holy slap’ now,&#8221; Jada revealed in her recent interview.</p>



<p>She explained that she calls it that &#8220;because so many positive things came after it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jada admitted: “I nearly didn’t even attend the Oscars that year, but I’m glad I did.”</p>

<p>“That moment of the s&#8211;t hitting the fan,&#8221; Jada expressed, &#8220;is when you see where you really are.”</p>



<p>In other words? To his core, Will is someone who will hurt his own career and public brand in order to defend her.</p>



<p>That means a lot to both of them.</p>
