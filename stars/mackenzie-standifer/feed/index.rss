<p>Mackenzie Standifer has been putting up with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ryan-edwards-yes-im-back-on-drugs-but-i-did-not-pull-a-knife-on-mackenzie-standifer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Edwards&#8217; nonsense</a> for years.</p>



<p>And while she might have been willing to cover for him during their marriage, these days, Mackenzie has no problem calling out her ex.</p>



<p>The latest drama began when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/mackenzie-edwards-ex-feud-ryan-edwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan&#8217;s girlfriend, Amanda Conner</a>, hinted that she might be pregnant with his child.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-ryan-edwards-expecting-another-child">Is Ryan Edwards Expecting Another Child?</h2>



<p>Now, Ryan and Amanda have not officially confirmed that they&#8217;re expecting another kid. But an eagle-eyed fan spotted a major clue in one of Amanda&#8217;s recent TikTok posts.</p>



<p>“Love Your videos! I’m a creeper. I can see what’s on your refrigerator,&#8221; the follower commented, according to <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/mackenzie-standifer-throws-shade-at-ryan-edwards-amid-baby-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>.</p>



<p>“… oh f–k,&#8221; Amanda replied, realizing, it seems, that an ultrasound had been displayed on the fridge.</p>



<p>The situation led to another possible revelation about Ryan&#8217;s personal life, courtesy of a comment allegedly made by Mackenzie.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mackenzie-standifer-claims-that-ryan-will-soon-be-a-father-of-five">Mackenzie Standifer Claims That Ryan Will Soon Be a Father of Five</h2>



<p>The Teen Mom Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAOkXp_PLD1/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@tm_chatter</a> claims that Mackenzie left a comment in which she alleged that Ryan is concealing a secret child.</p>



<p>“You have five kids. Please take care of them and yes I can count on,” Mackenzie wrote, according to the account.</p>



<p>When another commenter questioned Mackenzie&#8217;s claim, the former reality star (allegedly) replied:</p>



<p>“NDA’s, money and connections cover a lot of transgressions.”</p>

<p>We&#8217;re not sure how it would be possible for Ryan to hide a whole child, given how publicly he lives his life.</p>



<p>But according to Mackenzie, Ryan is a master of secrecy and manipulation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/ryan-edwards-mackenzie-standifer-divorce-details-revealed-is-he-banned-from-seeing-the-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mackenzie divorced Ryan</a> in 2023, and she claims that he&#8217;s been presenting a phony version of his life ever since.</p>



<p>The exes have two children together, and Mackenzie claims that Ryan has falsely convinced his fans that he&#8217;s a good dad.</p>

<p>“They get ZERO financial, emotional, physical support from their ‘father’ but thank GOD they get 30 mins of his precious time 2x a month stopping by for a pic for proof he saw them,” Mackenzie recently wrote on Instagram, according to tm_chatter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/ryan-edwards-arrested-again-handcuffed-in-court-this-time-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan&#8217;s battle with addiction</a> has led to numerous arrests and legal problems over the years.</p>

<p>For a while, it looked as though Ryan would finally be locked up for a long period of time.</p>



<p>But a sympathetic judge allowed the troubled <em>Teen Mom</em> star to enter treatment instead.</p>



<p>While in rehab, he<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/ryan-edwards-to-remain-behind-bars-into-2024-girlfriend-amanda-conners-asks-fans-for-prayers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> met Amanda</a>, and now, it sounds as though they&#8217;re expecting a kid together.</p>



<p>Ryan has yet to respond to the allegations that he has another kid that the public doesn&#8217;t know about.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll keep you updated on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Ryan Edwards appears to once again be in trouble with the law.</p>



<p>According to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/02/12/exclusive/">Mackenzie Edwards called the police</a> on her ex-husband back on January 31 because he allegedly threatened her via text message.</p>



<p>The 911 call was placed around 8:30 p.m. on this date.</p>



<p>Based on an official incident report (obtained by the aforementioned website), Mackenzie told the cops that she wanted them to be aware that Ryan was headed to her house to grab a computer cord&#8230; but she wanted the authorities aware “in case anything happened.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer don&#8217;t look happy in this throwback photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A local deputy was dispatched to the scene in order to meet Ryan there. </p>



<p>After he was apparently unable to locate the item that inspired his visit, the former Teen Mom participant said he&#8217;d come back another day and look for it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the home Ryan stopped by here was the same one <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-destroys-wifes-home-scrawls-death-threats-all-over-the-walls/">he trashed in February 2023</a>.</p>



<p>During that incident, Edwards scrawled VERY disturbing messages on the walls of his ex-spouse&#8217;s residence, including one that read:</p>



<p>“You slutting around is why this house felt cold and alone. I just could not stand you.”</p>



<p>On January 31 of this year, meanwhile, Mackenzie claims Ryan sent her <em>more</em> threatening messages after he left her home empty-handed.</p>

<p>“Shortly after Ryan and I left the residence, Mackenzie called back in advising Ryan texted her threatening messages,” the aforementioned deputy wrote in his police report. </p>



<p>“Mackenzie advised Ryan sent her a message stating, ‘You’re going to be hard-pressed to find another place to live and no one is going to survive anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mackenzie also told the cops that her former husband allegedly vowed to return to the home the next day to “retrieve his weapons,&#8221; explaining in further detail, per this same report:</p>



<p>&#8220;The only weapon in the house is her personal every day carry pistol. Mackenzie stated that she was going to bring the pistol with her to work just in case Ryan comes to the house.&#8221;</p>

Does that really surprise anyone?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ryan Edwards has been in and out of both jail and rehab on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>He was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/ryan-edwards-arrested-again-handcuffed-in-court-this-time-around/">most recently arrested in December</a> and is scheduled to go in front of a judge on April 23 to talk about his probation &#8212; which stems from a charge of harassment against Mackenzie last year.</p>



<p>Mackenzie, who filed a restraining order against Ryan in February of last year, told police in this case that she is “scared Ryan could harm her.”</p>

<p>In December, following his latest arrest, Ryan was ordered by Judge Gary Starnes to follow a strict set of rules.</p>



<p>For example, he is required to take monthly Vivitrol shots, which is a prescription injectable medicine designed to help curb alcohol and/or opioid dependence.</p>



<p>He was also ordered back then to attend counseling sessions and agree to random drug tests.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear at this time whether the new accusations will impact Ryan&#8217;s probation in any way.</p>

<p>It looks like Mackenzie Edwards is still in a feud with her ex &#8230; and her ex&#8217;s sentimental new gal.</p>



<p>Despite what rumors claim, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/mackenzie-edwards-responds-to-the-rumor-is-she-back-together-with-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mackenzie is not back with Ryan Edwards</a>. And she&#8217;ll always set people straight.</p>



<p>Ryan&#8217;s actual girlfriend is Amanda Conner &#8230; who is getting all <em>mushy </em>about him on social media.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mackenzie is shading these social media displays, and followers are <em>eating it up</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amanda-conner-was-feeling-sentimental">Amanda Conner was feeling sentimental</h2>



<p>On Instagram, Amanda shared a video to emphasize how strong her relationship with Ryan Edwards remains.</p>



<p>She shared a clip of Ryan driving in a truck with some very sappy lyrics playing.</p>



<p>It was the sort of emotional post that you&#8217;d expect from someone who&#8217;s 15 or maybe 20. But it&#8217;s fine; adults are also allowed to be a little <em>cringe </em>with their emotions, right?</p>

<p>Amanda shared that over the weekend.</p>



<p>A very short while later, Mackenzie shaded both her ex (feud or not, she and Ryan aren&#8217;t <em>officially </em>former spouses yet) and Amanda.</p>



<p>She took to her own Instagram Story to <em>vaguepost </em>&#8230; and she was not especially subtle.</p>

<p>“Y’all check on your ex[es], this wind is blowing trash around,” Mackenzie&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mackedwards95/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram Story</a> post read.</p>



<p>The post was simple text, white on black. No images, and no <em>explicit </em>references to the subject at hand.</p>



<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s shady post continued: “This weather is crazy.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-amanda-weigh-in-on-mackenzie-and-ryan-as-the-exes-feud">Did Amanda weigh in on Mackenzie and Ryan as the exes feud?</h2>



<p>Either Amanda did not see Mackenzie&#8217;s shade, did not interpret it as being about her, or chose to not respond.</p>



<p>Instead, she shared an inspirational message about how she has been clean (that is, sober) for six months &#8220;and counting.&#8221; Good for her!</p>



<p>While we&#8217;re not clear on why Amanda chose to share a series of her own mugshots to mark this milestone, that&#8217;s her business.</p>

<p>Amanda and Ryan met in rehab, earning the title &#8220;rehab girlfriend&#8221; from many in the <em>Teen Mom</em> fandom.</p>



<p>Ryan ended up in prison last year for not following the terms of his probation. His release from prison came in late December.</p>



<p>Amanda&#8217;s sappy video comes just a few weeks after his release. She&#8217;s clearly head over heels for him &#8230; but not everyone in his life feels the same way.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-amanda-spell-trouble-for-ryan-edwards">Does Amanda spell trouble for Ryan Edwards?</h2>



<p>Apparently, Amanda has a &#8220;reputation&#8221; for trouble where she lives. It seems that she would not dispute that, given her collection of mugshots.</p>



<p>Right now, those closest to Ryan want him to work on himself, staying clean and well-behaved. Or close enough.</p>



<p>There is a real worry that Ryan spending time with a volatile person with similar struggles will set him back. But Ryan has never needed someone else&#8217;s help to get into trouble.</p>

<p>Ryan Edwards was released from jail on December 23.</p>



<p>The former Teen Mom participant had been placed behind bars early last month after he failed to complete court-ordered requirements in the wake <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/ryan-edwards-arrested-again-handcuffed-in-court-this-time-around/">of his latest arrest</a>.</p>



<p>According to various reports, Edwards must take monthly shots of a medicine designed to curb substance above and must also attend a number of counseling sessions in order to remain free.</p>



<p>With questions about Ryan&#8217;s legal future now answered, many observers have turned to questions about his <em>personal</em> life.</p>

<p>Specifically, following ex-wife Mackenzie shared a video of Ryan playing with the former couple&#8217;s daughter, Stella, a handful of social media users are now wondering:</p>



<p><strong>Are the ex-spouses actually back together?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?</strong></p>



<p>Simply put, no.</p>



<p>“For 2024, the kids and I are going forward, not backwards. This was an old video,” <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/01/02/exclusive-mackenzie-edwards-responds-to-rumor-shes-back-with-ex-ryan-edwards-reveals-where-they-currently-stand/">Mackenzie said in response</a> to the uproar, telling The Ashley that Stella’s birthday was on Monday and adding:</p>



<p>“He is wearing his wedding ring in the video because we were married at the time.”</p>

<p>Ryan is currently dating a woman named Amanda, who was actually with him in late November when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/ryan-edwards-involved-in-bar-brawl-with-new-girlfriend-amanda-conners-will-he-be-heading-back-to-prison/">Edwards got into a bar altercation in Tennessee</a>.</p>



<p>The two are reportedly living together, which Mackenzie claims is a major reason why she isn&#8217;t talking to her ex these days.</p>



<p>“We don’t speak because [Ryan and Amanda] feel it’s disrespectful toward their relationship,” Mackenzie also told The Ashley.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope eventually Ryan and I can reestablish communication so we can co-parent our kids.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mackenzie filed for divorce from Ryan in February of 2022; she also request a protection order against him at the time. </p>



<p>In court documents last year, Mackenzie alleged that Ryan held a pocket knife to her back, grabbed her by the neck and shoved her against the wall, punched holes in the walls of their home, threw menthol nicotine in her eyes and committed acts of violence against her.</p>



<p>In April 2023, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-destroys-wifes-home-scrawls-death-threats-all-over-the-walls/">Ryan massacred the home</a> he had been sharing with Mackenzie and their kids. </p>



<p>In addition to Stella, the exes also share son Jagger &#8212; and both have sons from a previous relationship.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all very sad and we can only hope Ryan Edwards gets the help he so clearly needs, for the sake of his children if not for himself.</p>

<p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/">Ryan Edwards was arrested</a> on a slew of charges and sentenced to one year in prison.</p>



<p>A compassionate judge decided to grant Ryan a furlough in order to attend rehab, and these days, the troubled Teen Mom star is residing in a sober living facility instead of a jail cell.</p>



<p>During an appearance on last week&#8217;s <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </em>reunion show, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/ryan-edwards-says-he-tried-to-kill-himself-is-now-now-five-months-sober/">Ryan revealed that he tried to take his own life</a> amid his latest round of legal and substance abuse issues.</p>



<p>He added that he is now five months sober and intends to stay that way.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="572" height="420" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/76461147-12621981-Reunion_episodes_Ryan_Edwards_admitted_to_intentionally_overdosi-m-77_1697094407684-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-485296" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/76461147-12621981-Reunion_episodes_Ryan_Edwards_admitted_to_intentionally_overdosi-m-77_1697094407684-copy.jpg 572w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/76461147-12621981-Reunion_episodes_Ryan_Edwards_admitted_to_intentionally_overdosi-m-77_1697094407684-copy-300x220.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/76461147-12621981-Reunion_episodes_Ryan_Edwards_admitted_to_intentionally_overdosi-m-77_1697094407684-copy-335x246.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/76461147-12621981-Reunion_episodes_Ryan_Edwards_admitted_to_intentionally_overdosi-m-77_1697094407684-copy-347x255.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/76461147-12621981-Reunion_episodes_Ryan_Edwards_admitted_to_intentionally_overdosi-m-77_1697094407684-copy-520x382.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards makes an appearance here on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Fans of the show have been quick to praise Ryan&#8217;s success, and many have taken to social media to wish him well and encourage him to stay the course.</p>



<p>Edwards&#8217; future has never looked brighter, and amazingly, he&#8217;s even managed to repair his relationship with his teenage stepson, Bentley.</p>



<p>It was big of Bentley to forgive his dad for all the pain he&#8217;s caused.</p>



<p>But another one of Ryan&#8217;s victims will never give him a second chance, and with very good reason!</p>

But that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re talking, of course, about Mackenzie Standifer </p>



<p>Now, Mackenzie has three kids with Ryan, so she has no choice but to maintain ties with her ex.</p>



<p>(It also looks as though the exes haven&#8217;t finalized their divorce yet, so there&#8217;s that small matter to attend to.) </p>



<p>Anyway, before his latest arrest, Ryan trashed Mackenzie&#8217;s house so badly that she and her kids were forced to move &#8212; so yeah, she&#8217;s justified in being a little angry with the guy.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Recently, there were rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/mackenzie-standifer-did-she-really-dump-her-boyfriend-the-day-that-ryan-edwards-got-out-of-prison/">Ryan and Mackenzie were back together</a>, but thankfully, we now know that that&#8217;s not the case.</p>



<p>Mack was quick to put those rumors to rest when an Instagram follower broached the topic on Standifer&#8217;s page.</p>



<p>“Isn’t she back with Ryan?” this person commented, <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/teen-moms-mackenzie-edwards-denies-reconciling-with-ryan/">according to</a> <em>In Touch</em>.</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Standifer promptly responded, “God no lol.”</p>

<p>We have to take <em>In Touch</em>&#8216;s word for this, as Mackenzie has since deleted her Instagram page.</p>



<p>She might be so traumatized by her relationship with Ryan that the mere mention of his name is enough to chase her off of social media.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, we certainly don&#8217;t blame her.</p>

<p>Like so many others, Mackenzie was put through hell because of Ryan, repeatedly betrayed and punished for her continued trust in her husband.</p>



<p>Ryan has certainly suffered because of his misdeeds, but he&#8217;s also had remarkable luck.</p>



<p>Instead of serving his year in prison, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/ryan-edwards-has-a-new-girlfriend-an-ex-con-single-mom-whom-he-met-in-rehab/">Edwards is currently a free man with a new girlfriend</a>.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;s back on TV, to boot!</p>



<p>No wonder he&#8217;s not Mack&#8217;s favorite topic of conversation.</p>

<p>Back in July, Ryan Edwards received some good news for a change:</p>



<p>Edwards was in jail serving a one-year sentence for stalking and harassing his estranged wife, Mackenzie Standifer, when a generous judge decided to give the troubled <em>Teen Mom</em> star a second chance.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/">Ryan received a furlough </a>so that he could check into an inpatient rehab program and undergo treatment for his addiction issues.</p>



<p>When he went back to court a month later, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ryan-edwards-finishes-rehab-returns-to-courtroom-for-dramatic-hearing/">the judge was so pleased with Edwards&#8217; progress</a> that he allowed him to move into a sober living house instead of going back to jail.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-1024x633.png" alt="" class="wp-image-478599" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-1024x633.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-300x186.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-768x475.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-735x455.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-335x207.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-347x215.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-520x322.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-640x396.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-960x594.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM-1080x668.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-4.05.38-PM.png 1106w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards is BACK on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter! But that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>These days, Ryan is a semi-free man:</p>



<p>Sure, he has to pass daily drug tests and be in bed before curfew, but he&#8217;s allowed to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ryan-edwards-leaves-sober-living-house-to-play-golf-with-son-bentley-fans-express-concern/">step out and play golf with his son</a> now and then, which is the sort of independence most recently convicted felons can only dream of.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is all great news for Ryan, but it might be bad news for &#8230; Mackenzie&#8217;s ex-boyfriend?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie Standifer posted this selfie on Instagram in 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, according to a <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/9001881/teen-mom-mackenzie-edwards-dumped-boyfriend-josh-panter-ryan/">new report </a>from UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>, Mackenzie abruptly broke up with Josh Panter when she learned that Ryan had been released from jail.</p>



<p>“Josh thought the relationship was great,&#8221; says a source close to the situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;She even told people she was going to marry Josh, including family members. He feels like she faked it for seven months.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Josh Panter poses with his mother in a photo from 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Facebook)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The insider explains that Josh “didn’t see the split coming&#8221; and felt completely blindsided.</p>



<p>Panter&#8217;s pain was reportedly exacerbated by the fact that Mackenzie had gotten close to his entire family.</p>



<p>“When Ryan got out of prison, she dropped him and his family,&#8221; says the source.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie Standifer is sporting a different look these days. And while most fans seem to love the look, a handful of haters are giving her a hard time. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;They went to eat with some good friends and she was affectionate and happy with Josh throughout the night like nothing was wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, we don&#8217;t know if Mackenzie&#8217;s decision to dump Josh had anything to do with Ryan getting out of prison.</p>



<p>The timing is certainly interesting, but we doubt that Mackenzie has any real interest in getting back together with her estranged husband.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer are headed for divorce court. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After all, the reason Edwards was locked up was that he&#8217;d gone on a bender and spent several days terrorizing Standifer and her kids.</p>



<p>At one point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/ryan-edwards-stalked-mackenzie-standifer-with-assault-rifle-trashed-their-house-before-arrest/">Ryan trashed Mackenzie&#8217;s house</a> so badly that she was forced to move.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s generally not the kind of behavior that makes a woman miss her ex.</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan has publicly and repeatedly accused his wife, Mackenzie Standifer, of being unfaithful. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then again, we didn&#8217;t think <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/maci-bookout-blasted-by-fans-for-allowing-son-to-hang-out-with-abusive-piece-of-trash-ryan-edwards/">Maci Bookout would ever forgive Ryan Edwards</a>, and these days, she&#8217;s his biggest supporter!</p>



<p>The dude is clearly in possession of some sort of magic that only works on baby mamas and judges!</p>



<p>Hopefully, this time, he&#8217;ll realize how lucky he&#8217;s been and actually work to turn his life around.</p>



<p>But even if Ryan gets sober and becomes a model citizen, Mackenzie still shouldn&#8217;t forgive him.</p>



<p>The man has traumatized her kids quite enough already.</p>

<p>These days,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/"> Ryan Edwards is living in an inpatient rehab facility</a>, having been temporarily released from jail to undergo addiction treatment.</p>



<p>We wish him all the best in his efforts to get clean, but the reality of the situation is that he probably has more jail time coming to him, even if he finally manages to sober up.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/mackenzie-standifer-claps-back-at-trolls-who-say-she-deserved-to-be-abused-by-ryan-edwards/">Ryan stalked and harassed Mackenzie Standifer</a> and went on a drug-fueled bender prior to his latest arrest.</p>



<p>And because Edwards was already on probation when all of this happened, completing the program probably won&#8217;t be enough to make him a free man.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is another Ryan Edwards mug shot. We&#8217;ve lost track how many it&#8217;s been now for him.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But none of that had transpired when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/maci-bookout-offers-support-to-ryan-edwards-after-learning-he-was-placed-on-suicide-watch-during-recent-lock-up/">Ryan filmed a scene with Maci Bookout</a> for this week&#8217;s episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</em></p>



<p>In fact, it looked as though Bentley&#8217;s mom and dad were on the verge of repairing their co-parenting relationship.</p>



<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-answers-to-all-of-your-questions-about-the-worst-baby-daddy-in-teen-mom-history/">every other part of Ryan&#8217;s life </a>was in shambles, a fact he admitted to during the conversation.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Mackenzie is being an absolute pain in my ass. She don&#8217;t know why she left, it&#8217;s been everything under the sun. It&#8217;s because of my addiction, because I was outside in my garage,&#8221; he told Maci.</p>



<p>She responded by advising him to &#8220;keep focusing on you and all these crazy children and stay away from her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not shocking to me. I know when we filmed the reunion and had that conversation about starting fresh with coparenting, she&#8217;s not gonna let this happen, she&#8217;s not,&#8221; Maci later told her husband, Taylor McKinney. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;And then she lost her mind anytime him and Bentley were gonna go do something because she couldn&#8217;t go, because it was supposed to be the two of them.&#8221;&#8216;</p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a little surprising to hear Maci take Ryan&#8217;s side against Mackenzie, but it&#8217;s important to remember that at that time, she was only hearing his side of the story.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do think this has everything to do with Ryan and Bentley&#8217;s relationship growing, me and Ryan trying to work together. I don&#8217;t think she can handle it,&#8221; Bookout continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Bentley is the one that pays for all of this, so we have to stay on the same team. I hope this divorce doesn&#8217;t get messy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Maci added that Bentley was &#8220;kind of shocked&#8221; to learn about his dad&#8217;s divorce, he didn&#8217;t seem &#8220;bothered by it or upset.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s never really been a big fan of Mackenzie&#8217;s,&#8221; she explained.</p>



<p>But despite Maci&#8217;s hope that the Ryan&#8217;s split wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;get messy,&#8221; it quickly did exactly that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan has publicly and repeatedly accused his wife, Mackenzie Standifer, of being unfaithful. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Later in the episode, a <em>Teen Mom </em>producer named Kiki paid a visit to Ryan in order to ask about some shocking allegations made by Mackenzie.</p>



<p>&#8220;She said I f&#8212;ing held a knife to her back or something like that … f&#8212; no, that&#8217;s so dumb,&#8221; he said, denying that he held her at knifepoint. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone knows when I get angry, I get f&#8212;ing angry. So she&#8217;s gonna use that against me. But I ain&#8217;t never put my hands on a woman ever before.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer are headed for divorce court. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ryan has publicly accused Mackenzie of cheating on him on numerous occasions, and it seems he was fixating on the idea at the time of the previous night&#8217;s argument.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, she left this house last night and there was only one reason why she left this house,&#8221; he told Kiki. </p>



<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t lie very well, she&#8217;ll stumble over every word she says and I was like, &#8216;Where the f&#8212; did you stay last night?&#8217; and she couldn&#8217;t come up with a good answer. So I started putting two and two together.&#8221;</p>



<p>He went on to suggest that Mackenzie was jealous of his friendship with Maci.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what kind of pissed Mackenzie off too, like really. I don&#8217;t think she ever wanted us to have a relationship,&#8221; he said, adding that Bentley &#8220;didn&#8217;t like [Mackenzie] anyways.&#8221; </p>



<p>Kiki then asked whether he felt his wife was &#8220;threatened&#8221; by his coparenting relationship, to which he replied:</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I think that really f&#8212;ing sent her over the edge.&#8221;</p>



<p>Eventually, of course, the truth of the confrontation came out:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards is in trouble with the law once again. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an addict, you are getting a divorce, can&#8217;t go back to your house, kids no longer live with you. That is a slippery slope,&#8221; Kiki said, prompting Ryan to blurt out, &#8220;I done f&#8212;ed up, I ain&#8217;t gonna lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>The producer then asked Ryan if he had relapsed amid all of the latest drama, to which he replied, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>So yeah, given that Ryan was on drugs at the time of the incident, and he later came back and trashed the house, we&#8217;re gonna go ahead and believe Mackenzie&#8217;s version of events.</p>



<p>Edwards is due back in court on August 12, at which time a judge will assess his progress and determine his fate.</p>

<p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/mackenzie-standifer-demands-longer-sentence-for-ryan-edwards-as-teen-mom-stars-connections-to-judge-are-exposed/">Ryan Edwards was arrested </a>following a public meltdown that could have ended in tragedy.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-destroys-wifes-home-scrawls-death-threats-all-over-the-walls/">accusing Mackenzie Standifer of cheating on him</a>, Ryan stalked and harassed her, and trashed the house they once shared to the point that it was no longer livable.</p>



<p>At the time of his arrest, Ryan was found passed out in his car with multiple drugs in the glove compartment.</p>



<p>Edwards was on probation at the time of his most recent brush with the law, and it was widely assumed that he would remain behind bars for a long time to come.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="520" height="520" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend.png" alt="Ryan Edwards, On the Mend?" class="wp-image-404451" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-300x300.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-150x150.png 150w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-480x480.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-320x320.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-200x200.png 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-335x335.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ryan-edwards-on-the-mend-347x347.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards has battled an addiction to drugs for years. We hope he&#8217;s now all clean and sober. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>So Ryan was probably as surprised as anyone when a judge granted a furlough on the condition that he check into an addiction treatment facility.</p>



<p>Ryan was serving a 1-year sentence for harassing Mackenzie, and he&#8217;s still awaiting trial for a slew of other charges.</p>



<p>But Judge Gary Starnes took pity on the 35-year-old former reality star and gave him one last chance at getting clean.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="735" height="708" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo.png" alt="Ryan Edwards MTV Photo" class="wp-image-408890" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-300x289.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-335x323.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-347x334.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-520x501.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-640x616.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards has had many brushes with the law.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s time for you to go to the program. It’s your last chance to do this,” the judge told Ryan, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/8587871/teen-mom-ryan-edwards-court-drugs/">according to</a> UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>. </p>



<p>“You need to do what you can. If you violate rehab, if you leave, you’ll be charged with escape and you will get consecutive sentences.”</p>



<p>Judge Starnes revealed that he had reviewed Ryan&#8217;s extensive legal and medical histories &#8212; which he called “disturbing&#8221; &#8212; before reaching his decision.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="452" height="405" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-in-trump-hat.jpg" alt="Ryan Edwards in Trump Hat" class="wp-image-403458" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-in-trump-hat.jpg 452w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-in-trump-hat-300x269.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-in-trump-hat-335x300.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-in-trump-hat-347x311.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards is a fan of Donald Trump. Does that really surprise anyone?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The judge indicated that Ryan&#8217;s time in rehab would count toward his sentence, and he hinted that successfully completing treatment would lead to a shorter sentence for his other crimes.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don’t want to spend two to three years in custody if you can get treatment,&#8221; said the judge.</p>



<p>Ryan is due back in court on August 14, at which time, Judge Starnes will evaluate his progress.</p>

<p></p>



<p>It&#8217;s the sort of second chance that many inmates would no doubt kill for.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s reason to believe that Ryan might not be able to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-sentenced-to-1-year-in-prison-for-harassing-estranged-wife-mackenzie-standifer/">Edwards has fled rehab multiple times</a>, with his most recent escape coming earlier this year.</p>



<p>It was a development that left Judge Starnes with no choice but to lock him up.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mackenzie was in court, but the reporter for <em>The Sun</em> says she did not communicate with Ryan or his parents in any way.</p>



<p>Mack and Ryan have two children together, and she was likely on hand just to find out what sort of fate would be handed down to the father of her kids.</p>



<p>No one from Ryan&#8217;s family has publicly commented on the situation.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>It&#8217;s been a tough year for troubled Teen Mom star Ryan Edwards.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/maci-bookout-supports-ryan-edwards-in-court-troubled-teen-mom-star-to-remain-behind-bars/">Edwards is currently behind bars</a> awaiting trial on a slew of charges.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s already been sentenced to a year in jail for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-seen-fighting-with-cops-in-shocking-new-arrest-video/">stalking and harassing his estranged wife, Mackenzie Standifer</a>.</p>



<p>And since we was on probation during his latest bender and the arrest that brought to a halt, it&#8217;s likely that Ryan will be locked up for a very, very long time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan and Mackenzie in happier times. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s bad news for Ryan, but it&#8217;s likely welcome news for Mackenzie, who&#8217;s spent years being terrorized by her soon-to-be ex-husband.</p>



<p>For most of this year she kept a low profile, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/mackenzie-standifer-claps-back-at-trolls-who-say-she-deserved-to-be-abused-by-ryan-edwards/">Mackenzie returned to TikTok</a> last week to assure her fans (and haters) that she&#8217;s thriving in her new life as a single mom.</p>



<p>Mack was instantly reminded of why she took a hiatus in the first place, as fans promptly resumed speculating wildly about her personal life.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan has publicly and repeatedly accused his wife, Mackenzie Standifer, of being unfaithful. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Specifically, they began alleging that Mackenzie has entered a romantic relationship with a longtime friend named Josh Panter.</p>



<p>Now, in a new interview with In Touch, Mackenzie has denied the rumors, insisting that she&#8217;s single and focusing on her duties as a working mom.</p>



<p>I</p>



<p>F</p>



<p>“I do not have a boyfriend. I’m focused on my career and my children,” Mackenzie tells the outlet.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie Standifer is sporting a different look these days. And while most fans seem to love the look, a handful of haters are giving her a hard time. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I’m working on myself to give them the life and future they deserve.”</p>



<p>Panter echoed the statement, telling UK tabloid The Sun that he and Mackenzie are just friends.</p>



<p>“I have known Mackenzie for 10 years or so, then earlier this year we got reconnected,” Josh tells the outlet. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie has a message for all the haters out there. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Mackenzie and I are friends and enjoy each other’s company. Neither of us are worried about ‘titles.’ We both just came out of a marriage.”</p>



<p>The rumor seems to have originated with a Facebook post from Josh&#8217;s mom, in which she shared a photo of Mackenzie&#8217;s kids and gushed about them in the caption.</p>



<p>“My blonde bandits … I love them littles,” Cindy Green Panter wrote.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie Standifer posted this selfie on Instagram in 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Many took the fact that their families were on vacation together as confirmation of the Mackenzie-Josh romance.</p>



<p>But it seems that the two newly single divorcees are just enjoying one another&#8217;s company in a platonic way &#8212; for now, at least.</p>



<p>Neither party has ruled out the possibility of a future romance, but it seems that Mackenzie has enough going on in her life these days without adding a new love affair into the mix.</p>

<p>But hey, they say the best romantic relationships start off as frienships!</p>



<p>Whatever happens, it seems that with a very dark chapter behind her, Mackenzie&#8217;s future is looking extremely bright!</p>

<p>Ryan Edwards might be the worst husband in the history of the Teen Mom franchise, which is really saying something.</p>



<p>And of course, no one has suffered more on Ryan&#8217;s account than his estranged wife Mackenzie Standifer.</p>



<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/maci-bookout-supports-ryan-edwards-in-court-troubled-teen-mom-star-to-remain-behind-bars/">Edwards is in prison</a> after being arrested for stalking and harassing Standifer.</p>



<p>During his latest bender, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-sentenced-to-1-year-in-prison-for-harassing-estranged-wife-mackenzie-standifer/">Ryan broke in to the house he once shared with Mackenzie</a> and trashed the place so badly that it was rendered unlivable. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer are headed for divorce court. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Ryan is currently awaiting trial, and since he was on probation at the time of his most recent arrest, it&#8217;s possible that he could be locked up for several years.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s bad news for Ryan &#8212; but great news for Mackenzie, who&#8217;s finally enjoying some freedom after years of being tethered to an abusive, narcissistic addict.</p>



<p>Mack has been keeping a low profile in the months since Ryan&#8217;s latest arrest, but she returned to TikTok this week to send a message to the trolls and haters who think that she deserved to be abused.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie has a message for all the haters out there. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Sitting in her car with what looked to be a set of scrubs on, Mackenzie mouthed the following words:</p>



<p>&#8220;B&#8211;ches be like, &#8216;Um, I heard something about you.&#8217; Uh, okay, cool. Go do it again, Debbie. I don&#8217;t give a f&#8211;k.&#8221;</p>



<p>The caption she added to the video made it clear that the intended target was the critics who accused her of ignoring Ryan&#8217;s red flags:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.tiktok.com/@mackedwards85/video/7252792184024337707?is_from_webapp=1&#038;sender_device=pc&#038;web_id=7236340838733202987
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Me when someone says I deserved every bit of what happened,&#8221; Mackenzie wrote.</p>



<p>To be clear, Ryan was an addict with a long history of legal troubles and abusive behavior long before he met and married Mackenzie.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that she&#8217;s in any way to blame for the abuse that she endured.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie Standifer is not happy about the criticism she&#8217;s been receiving online.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For starters, she was 21 years old when she married Ryan.</p>



<p>He was an older, established television star, and he managed to conceal the worst parts of his character until Mackenzie had already committed herself to him.</p>



<p>Of course, none of that really matters, as abuse victims are literally never to blame for the actions of their abusers.</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mackenzie Standifer is sporting a different look these days. And while most fans seem to love the look, a handful of haters are giving her a hard time. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Mack concurs with the belief that she stayed with Ryan longer than she should have, but it&#8217;s important to bear in mind that she has kids to take care of, and she may have thought that staying married was the best of way of providing them with stability and consistency.</p>



<p>And like many people with addicts in their lives, Mackenzie likely <em>wanted</em> to believe that Ryan would get clean, and that desire made her vulnerable to his frequent promises to sober up.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, she&#8217;s a victim who&#8217;s now going about the very difficult business of rebuilding her life, and the social media strangers who are making that process more difficult should probably take some time and reflect on why they&#8217;re so awful.</p>
