<p>After everything he&#8217;s been through, is this really how King Charles&#8217; reign will end?</p>



<p>Buckingham Palace announced in February of last year that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/king-charles-breaks-silence-on-stunning-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles had been diagnosed with cancer</a>, but officials did not offer any specifics with regard to the severity of his condition or the organs affected.</p>



<p>The same went for Kate Middleton after she announced her cancer diagnosis. For whatever reason, the royals have decided to keep their conditions under their hats &#8212; or, under their crowns, if you like.</p>



<p>However, insiders claim that Charles&#8217; prognosis is an &#8220;open secret&#8221; among royal staffers, and that those closest to him know exactly what kind of cancer he&#8217;s battling. </p>



<p>And he is, truly, in for the fight of his life. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-pancreatic-cancer-diagnosis-what-would-it-mean-for-his-future">King Charles&#8217; Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis: What Would It Mean For His Future?</h2>



<p>According to a report from <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/king-charles-given-2-years-to-live-with-pancreatic-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>, King Charles was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given just two years to live.</p>



<p>Charles reportedly received the diagnosis after undergoing surgery for an enlarged prostate earlier this year.</p>



<p>We should note that the <em>In Touch</em> report has not been confirmed by either Buckingham Palace or any other media outlets.</p>



<p>The report also claims that Charles plans to undergo treatment to &#8220;extend his life&#8221; and will continue to take a partial break from his royal duties.</p>



<p>Pancreatic is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, and it&#8217;s claimed the lives of such public figures as Steve Jobs, Alex Trebek, and Patrick Swayze.</p>

<p>Charles, of course, waited 73 years to become king, and his commitment to his royal duties is the stuff of legend.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that he plans to continue working despite his recent &#8212; and allegedly quite serious &#8212; health issues.</p>



<p>“Charles is keeping up with some appearances, not only to squash the wild conspiracy theories and false reports of his death, but to ensure people that he’s still able to perform his duties as king,” says one insider.</p>

<p>The source adds that Charles is “following doctors’ orders and willing to try any treatment to extend his life by a few years, at least.”</p>



<p>Palace officials have confirmed that Charles has cancer and that he plans to continue working, but they&#8217;ve said little else about his condition.</p>



<p>“His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties,” the palace’s statement said. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-king-charles-feeling-now">How is King Charles Feeling Now?</h2>



<p>“Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.”</p>



<p>“His aides can tell that Charles still worries about his legacy,” the second insider shares, adding that the head royal “tends to worry himself.”</p>



<p>Charles&#8217; wife, Camilla, his sister, Anne, and his son William have all been taking on additional royal duties to pick up the slack for the ailing king.</p>



<p>But as the year has progressed, His Royal Highness has made several high-profile appearances. In fact, despite his condition, Charles has attended more royal events this year than his daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, who was also diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer. (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-says-shes-in-remission-from-cancer-one-year-after-starting-treatment/">Kate is now in remission</a>.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-royal-family-in-crisis">A Royal Family In Crisis</h2>



<p>Ever since both Kate and Charles were diagnosed, the royal family has been plagued with rumors.</p>



<p>Both royals have become the subjects of conspiracy theories, with Kate carrying the brunt. In fact, it was the horrendous conspiracy theories ranging from William&#8217;s infidelity to talk of bulimia that ultimately forced Kate to reveal she had cancer.  </p>



<p>Meanwhile, social media users actually alleged that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/king-charles-dead-palace-responds-to-latest-fatal-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles had passed away</a>, and his death was being kept secret by Buckingham Palace.</p>



<p>The palace refuted that rumor with a swift statement reading, “We are happy to confirm that The King is continuing with official private business.&#8221;</p>



<p>But keeping the nature of his cancer so hush-hush has caused concern now, nearly a year later, that same concern is mounting. </p>



<p>Especially if this report turns out to be true.</p>

<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton are reportedly taking steps to prepare for the death of King Charles.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-worrying-update-stepson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles was diagnosed with cancer</a> in 2024, and the specifics of his condition remain unclear.</p>



<p>Insiders have claimed that the monarch is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-diagnosed-with-pancreatic-cancer-given-two-years-to-live-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffering from pancreatic cancer</a>, which has one of the highest mortality rates of any form of the disease.</p>

<p>That news has not been confirmed by Buckingham Palace.</p>



<p>The king&#8217;s trip to Australia in late 2024 briefly bolstered hopes for a full recovery. But the lack of official updates is troubling.</p>



<p>And the latest reports indicate that in order to prepare for all eventualities, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-queen-ready-health-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William and Kate are preparing to take over as king and queen</a> at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-and-william-are-reportedly-prepared-to-take-over-for-charles">Kate and William Are Reportedly Prepared to Take Over For Charles</h2>



<p>“It’s not a subject that people really talk about very openly. But everyone is aware that Charles’ health is failing,” the source close to the situation tells <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/william-and-kate-prepping-for-failing-king-charles-death-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>. </p>



<p>“The last thing Kate and William want to do is to put a case forward for Charles to abdicate. They want him to go on as long as he physically wants to,&#8221; the insider adds.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there is that horrible reality of the fact he’s not getting any younger, and his condition means that the time to step up will be sooner rather than later in the years ahead.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="719" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-1024x719.jpg" alt="Queen Camilla, King Charles III, Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales pose for a photograph ahead of The Diplomatic Reception in the 1844 Room at Buckingham Palace on December 05, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-511908" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-768x539.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-2048x1438.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-960x674.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-1080x758.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1833488726-4-1200x842.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Queen Camilla, King Charles III, Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales pose for a photograph ahead of The Diplomatic Reception in the 1844 Room at Buckingham Palace on December 05, 2023 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images For Buckingham Palace)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles is 75, and Will and Kate would likely be preparing for the challenges of the throne even if he weren&#8217;t battling cancer.</p>



<p>But the preparations have an added layer of urgency as a result of the king&#8217;s health struggles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-charles-illness-creates-atmosphere-of-urgency">Charles&#8217; Illness Creates Atmosphere of Urgency</h2>



<p>“The reality is they have to prepare themselves for that eventuality and brace themselves to deal with it, both mentally and in practice,” says the source.</p>



<p>“They’ll be wonderful monarchs. William has been preparing all his life, but Kate has shown herself to be equally capable,” the palace insider adds.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="734" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1806223959-1024x734.jpg" alt="Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales attend a ceremonial welcome for The President and the First Lady of the Republic of Korea at Horse Guards Parade on November 21, 2023 in London, England.

<p>Obviously, the timing is less than ideal, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-cancer-treatment-complete-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate also battled cancer </a>recently.</p>



<p>But the source says she and William are well prepared to assume monarchical duties.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-says-shes-in-remission-from-cancer-one-year-after-starting-treatment/">Kate is in remission</a> from the illness, and she&#8217;s put in numerous public appearances in recent months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-william-and-kate-prepare-for-the-throne">William and Kate Prepare For the Throne</h2>



<p>“Charles is so happy William chose such a wonderful partner and future queen. It’s a big worry off his mind because he knows the monarchy will be in good hands,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p>“This is becoming more and more at the forefront of their minds. And Charles couldn’t be happier knowing that his legacy will eventually be taken over by them.”</p>

<p>In October of last year, Charles recently paused his treatment for an official state visit to Australia.</p>



<p>A second source described the trip as “just another example of the extraordinary work ethic he got from his mother.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>King Charles and his loved ones made a much-anticipated public appearance on December 25, attending Christmas Day services at a church on Sandringham.</p>



<p>This was an especially noteworthy event because the monarch was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and because he was joined by, among other, Kate Middleton.</p>



<p>The Princess of Wales has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/kate-middleton-returns-welcomes-special-u-k-visitors-see-the-photos/">slowly returning to public duties</a> after her <em>own</em> cancer diagnosis and a course of chemotherapy.</p>

<p>“All of us go through some form of suffering at some stage in our life, be it mental or physical,” the king said in his pre-taped message for his annual Christmas address, as well. </p>



<p>“The degree to which we help one another &#8212; and draw support from each other, be we people of faith or of none &#8212; is a measure of our civilization as nations.”</p>



<p>As of this writing, it remains unclear just what type of cancer Charles and Kate have been battling.</p>



<p>We cannot confirm reports that the former is suffering from pancreatic cancer and only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-diagnosed-with-pancreatic-cancer-given-two-years-to-live-report/">has two years or so to live</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in his annual message, Charles told the public:</p>



<p>“I am speaking to you today from the Chapel of the former Middlesex Hospital in London and thinking especially of the many thousands of professionals and volunteers here in the United Kingdom and across the Commonwealth who, with their skills and out of the goodness of their heart, care for others, often at some cost to themselves.&#8221;</p>



<p>Charles didn&#8217;t cite Middleton by name during this address, but made a clear reference to her as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;From a personal point of view, I offer special heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses who this year have supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am deeply grateful too to all those who have offered us their own kind words of sympathy and encouragement.&#8221;</p>

<p>This marked the king&#8217;s third Christmas speech since he ascended the throne after his mother, Queen Elizabeth, passed away in September 2022.</p>



<p>It is the first, however, since he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February.</p>



<p>In a voiceover for the broadcast of her annual Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey &#8212; which was recorded this month but broadcast on Tuesday evening &#8212; Middleton for her part reflected on the love and support that she has received over the past many months.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;It also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have an update on the condition of King Charles.</p>



<p>According to a Buckingham Palace source who spoke on Friday to NBC News, the monarch&#8217;s cancer treatment is “moving in a positive direction,” nearly a year after he was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/king-charles-breaks-silence-on-stunning-cancer-diagnosis/">diagnosed with the awful disease</a>.</p>



<p>The insider emphasized that while progress <em>has</em> been made, the King&#8217;s cancer remains in a “managed condition,” meaning that his “treatment cycle will continue into next year.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515635" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-960x641.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2190119861-1200x802.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">King Charles III attends a reception at Waltham Forest Town Hall on December 20, 2024 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mina Kim &#8211; WPA Pool / Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It remains unclear just what type of cancer has afflicted King Charles.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been chatter that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-diagnosed-with-pancreatic-cancer-given-two-years-to-live-report/">he&#8217;s battling pancreatic cancer</a>, which has an extremely low five-year survival rate; to be clear, we cannot confirm this rumor.</p>



<p>King Charles was just a year and a half into his reign when Buckingham Palace initially confirmed his cancer diagnosis in February. </p>



<p>The statement explained that the 76-year-old chose to share his health status partly “in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="729" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-729x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515636" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-729x1024.jpg 729w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-768x1079.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-1458x2048.jpg 1458w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-683x960.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-769x1080.jpg 769w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-854x1200.jpg 854w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2189853930-scaled.jpg 1822w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">King Charles III and Paris priest Fr Dominic Robinson SJ leave an Advent Service celebrating the strength and courage of faith communities at The Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception on December 17, 2024 in London, England.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Arthur Edwards &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>During a visit to the Dyson Cancer Center at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, England in September, Queen Camilla &#8212; who married Charles in 2005 &#8212; was asked by Suzy Moon of Macmillan Cancer Support about the king’s health status. </p>



<p>&#8220;He is doing very well,&#8221; she responded at the time.</p>



<p>Charles resumed his Royal duties in April after taking several weeks off.</p>



<p>In January, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kate-middleton/">Kate Middleton</a> was hospitalized for almost two weeks to undergo abdominal surgery for unspecified reasons back then.</p>



<p>While initial tests did <em>not</em> indicate cancer, further testing revealed “cancer had been present,” she said in a taped video statement.</p>

<p>For his part, the 75-year old monarch issued his first public statement in regard to the illness not long after we learned about it.</p>



<p>“I would like to express my most heartfelt thanks for the many messages of support and good wishes I have received in recent days,” the King said through Buckingham Palace.</p>



<p>“It is equally heartening to hear how sharing my own diagnosis has helped promote public understanding and shine a light on the work of all those organisations which support cancer patients and their families across the U.K. and wider world.</p>



<p>“My lifelong admiration for their tireless care and dedication is all the greater as a result of my own personal experience.”</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, it seems that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-diagnosed-with-pancreatic-cancer-given-two-years-to-live-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">King Charles&#8217; battle with cancer</a> has brought him closer to his eldest son, Prince William.</p>



<p>Equally unsurprising is the fact that Charles&#8217; health issues have put him in a reflective mood and led him to dole out advice to the future king.</p>



<p>But while you might expect that Charles would be advising his son on how to fulfill the duties of the throne, it seems the monarch has been focusing on much more personal matters.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-offers-marriage-advice-to-prince-william">King Charles Offers Marriage Advice to Prince William</h2>



<p>According to journalist and royal expert Ingrid Seward, Charles recently cautioned William not to repeat the mistakes that he had made in his own marriages.</p>



<p>“[His father] said, ‘Look, William, there’s nothing more important than your family,’” Seward claimed in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/king-charles-warned-prince-william-dont-make-mistakes-made-marriage-expert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a>.</p>

<p> “&#8217;I just did duty, duty, duty. I neglected my marriage, and look what happened.’”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-charles-marital-history">Charles&#8217; Marital History</h2>



<p>Charles has been married to Queen Camilla since 2005, but the couple&#8217;s path to the altar was not an easy one.</p>



<p>They first met at a polo match in 1970, but whatever courtship they initiated was interrupted by Charles&#8217; stint in the Royal Navy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="716" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1229527136-1024x716.jpg" alt="Britain's Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge attend a National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in Westminster, amid the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease on November 8, 2020 in London, England.

<p>He and Camilla both married other people and later divorced.</p>



<p>Charles&#8217; first wife and William&#8217;s mother, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/prince-harry-loses-police-protection-lawsuit-cops-treat-me-worse-than-princess-diana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Diana, was killed in a 1997 car accident</a> at the age of 36.</p>



<p>The marriage between Charles and Diana was famously fraught, and the two separated on contentious terms.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Britain's King Charles III and Prince William, Prince of Wales attend the National Service of Remembrance at The Cenotaph on November 12, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-514980" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1778211000-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Britain&#8217;s King Charles III and Prince William, Prince of Wales attend the National Service of Remembrance at The Cenotaph on November 12, 2023 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kin Cheung &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But by the time of Diana&#8217;s death, she and Charles had worked out a civil co-parenting arrangement, and he was reportedly devastated by her passing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-william-s-situation">William&#8217;s Situation</h2>



<p>William&#8217;s love life has followed a much more conventional path, but it hasn&#8217;t been without its challenges.</p>

<p>Now, as she and William prepare for their new lives as king and queen, Charles is understandably eager to offer advice.</p>



<p>And it seems that his life of royal duty has ironically taught him that nothing is more important than family.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/king-charles-of-course-i-booted-harry-and-meghan-from-frogmore-cottage-they-deserved-it/">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were evicted from Frogmore Cottage</a> by order of King Charles.</p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s apartments in the Windsor estate had served as their home base during visits to the UK, and Charles&#8217; decision to kick the Sussexes out was regarded by many as an unnecessary act of aggression.</p>



<p>Defenders of the king say he was merely cutting costs, while Sussex supporters insist that this was a punitive measure prompted by Charles&#8217; outrage over claims made in Harry&#8217;s memoir.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the move seems to have had the effect of deepening the rift between the warring factions of the royal family, at least temporarily.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-and-prince-harry-s-tense-relationship">King Charles and Prince Harry&#8217;s Tense Relationship</h2>





<p>There have been occasional signs of easing tensions, such as when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/prince-harry-meghan-markle-blasted-by-royal-insiders-for-leaking-details-of-birthday-call-to-king-charles/">Harry and Meghan called Charles on his birthday</a>, and royal insiders say the king happily accepted this long-distance olive branch.</p>



<p>Apparently, the monarch chatted with his youngest son, his daughter-in-law, and his two American grandchildren for several minutes before reluctantly hanging up to mingle with his in-person guests.</p>



<p>It was a surprising turn of events, as only a few months prior, Harry had poignantly suggested to his father that the eviction might lead to a permanent estrangement.</p>

<p>The source of this information is a controversial book by journalist Omid Scobie, a longtime ally of the Sussexes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-throwing-down-the-gauntlet">Throwing Down the Gauntlet</h2>



<p>According to Scobie, when Charles kicked the Sussexes out of Frogmore, Harry indicated that the move might have lasting consequences.</p>



<p>“Don’t you want to see your grandchildren?” Harry allegedly asked Charles.</p>

<p>There are many ways that that question can be interpreted, and since Scobie is a longtime Sussex defender, he likely intended the anecdote to bolster the duke&#8217;s image by demonstrating his ability and willingness to stand up to his domineering father.</p>



<p>But not everyone took it that way.</p>



<p>Critics insist that Harry was threatening Charles and attempting to use his own children as bargaining chips.</p>





<p>The account seems to have backfired, as many have praised Charles for his refusal to back down in the face of Harry&#8217;s &#8220;bullying.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>The far more likely explanation for this exchange is that Harry was simply pointing out to his father that it would be more difficult for him to visit with the entire family in tow if the king took steps that would force him to secure his own accommodations.</p>



<p>And indeed it has been. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h2>



<p>Due to security concerns, Harry has traveled solo during his past several visits to London. And once again, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-excluded-from-royals-christmas-plans-for-sixth-straight-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Sussexes will <em>not </em>be making the trip to the UK for Christmas</a> this year.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Charles&#8217; role as the royal landlord is now creating additional issues, as he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/king-charles-prince-andrew-feud-royal-residence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked Prince Andrew to vacate Windsor Castle</a>, but the king&#8217;s brother has thus far refused.</p>



<p>Apparently, Charles is more sympathetic to the scandal-plagued Andrew than to his own son.</p>



<p>The birthday phone call may have been a step in the right direction, but clearly, this family has a long way to go before they can spend a peaceful holiday together.</p>

<p>No, all is still no well with the Royal family. Perhaps it never will be. </p>



<p>Last month, Prince Harry was back in the United Kingdom. As the world very well knows, his father has a serious illness.</p>



<p>Put those two facts together and one would think that Harry and King Charles would reunite at some point over the while he was in town, right?</p>



<p>Wrong! One might think this, but one would apparently be mistaken.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-hasn-t-seen-king-charles-in-a-hot-minute">Prince Harry Hasn&#8217;t Seen King Charles In A Hot Minute</h2>



<p>According to <em>The Daily Beast</em>, Queen Camilla is discouraging any contact between her husband and his son in the wake of the latter previously abandoning his family and the former having been diagnosed with cancer.</p>



<p>“[Camilla] has been the principal voice urging Charles to slow down and take things easy,” her <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/queen-camilla-wants-king-charles-to-skip-meeting-with-prince-harry-sources">friend told the aforementioned outlet</a> over the weekend, adding: </p>



<p>“The last thing she wants him to do is to get stressed out over a meeting with Harry.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="708" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-1024x708.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510442" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-300x207.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-768x531.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-960x663.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-1080x746.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670-1200x829.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1240575670.jpg 1479w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">King Charles proceeds through the Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament at the Houses of Parliament, in London, on May 10, 2022. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by HANNAH MCKAY/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-relationship-right-now">Their Relationship Right Now</h2>



<p>In late July, we reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/prince-harry-king-charles-no-longer-on-speaking-terms/">Harry and Charles weren&#8217;t talking</a> to each other.</p>



<p>The Prince of Wales even has concerns that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-king-charles-never-again/">he&#8217;ll never see his dad alive again</a> considering Charles revealed several months ago that he was battling some form of cancer.</p>



<p>The 75-year old monarch has only seen his youngest son once this year&#8230; when the Harry flew to his native country in February after hearing of his father’s illness.</p>



<p>Later this month, however, the King has an important trip to Australia planned &#8212; and those close are afraid that meeting up with Harry might increase his levels of anxiety.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510443" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-991339412-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Charles and Camilla, look at each other as they reopen the newly-renovated Edwardian community hall The Strand Hall during day three of a visit to Wales on July 4, 2018 in Builth Wells, Wales.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To date, Charles is heeding this advice.</p>



<p>But, deep down, this same <em>Daily Beast </em>insider says the King years to make up with his estranged child.</p>



<p>“The king has an instinctive impulse towards Christian reconciliation, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/king-charles-cancer-explained/">his cancer diagnosis</a> has only sharpened that,” the friend says.</p>



<p>“He wants this settled, not just because he loves both his sons, but because it has been so destabilizing for the monarchy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The New York Post has reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment in the wake of this report, but has not yet heard anything back.</p>

<p>King Charles is celebrating his 76th birthday today.</p>



<p>And the occasion is made all the more special by the fact that the royals have endured a tremendously tumultuous year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-devotes-his-birthday-to-service">King Charles Devotes His Birthday to Service</h2>



<p>Charles will reportedly spend his day visiting a &#8220;surplus food festival&#8221; as part of the Coronation Food Project that he launched last year.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://people.com/kate-middleton-prince-william-lead-tributes-king-charles-birthday-8744716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>, the project is designed to &#8220;tackle food waste and food insecurity across the UK.&#8221;</p>



<p>Demonstrating to the world that he remains a hands-on king despite recent challenges, Charles will spend his birthday touring facilities and speaking with the project&#8217;s workers and beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The Windsors are not usually a very demonstrative family, but they make a point of publicly extending birthday greetings to one another via social media.</p>



<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton kept the tradition going today with an Instagram post saluting Charles.</p>



<p>On their official account, the couple posted a photo of Charles from his recent trip to Samoa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wishing His Majesty The King a very Happy Birthday today,&#8221; <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a62905813/william-kate-royals-wish-king-charles-happy-birthday-76-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their caption reads</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reached out to Charles. The couple is not currently active on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hope-for-a-better-year-ahead">Hope For a Better Year Ahead</h2>



<p>Despite the difficulties of the past year, Charles shows no signs of slowing down. He spent the night before his birthday attending the London premiere of <em>Gladiator II</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to Charles&#8217; health issues, the royals have dealt with a number of other crises in recent months.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/kate-middleton-working-out-again-doing-well-following-chemotherapy-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Middleton is still battling cancer</a>, though she appears to be on the upswing. The Princess of Wales recently revealed that she&#8217;s completed chemotherapy.</p>



<p>And in recent weeks, reports of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/king-charles-prince-andrew-feud-royal-residence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles&#8217; feud with Prince Andrew</a> have dominated tabloid headlines in the UK.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been dreadful. It&#8217;s probably been the hardest year in my life,&#8221; the Prince of Wales said during a recent appearance at the Earthshot Awards</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1243634887-4-900x1024.jpg" alt="Camilla, Queen Consort, King Charles III, Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales pose for a photo ahead of their Majesties the King and the Queen Consortâs reception for Heads of State and Official Overseas Guests at Buckingham Palace on September 18, 2022 in London, England.

<p>.&#8221;So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult.&#8221;</p>



<p>No doubt Charles and the rest of the royals are praying for a less eventful 2025.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s hoping his birthday wish comes true.</p>

<p>King Charles and Prince Andrew have always had a complicated relationship.</p>



<p>In recent years, the main point of contention has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/prince-william-kate-middleton-support-decision-to-evict-harry-meghan-wed-rather-live-next-door-to-sex-offender-prince-andrew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew&#8217;s numerous scandals</a>, including his involvement with infamous sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p>But the rift appears to be less serious than the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/prince-william-bans-prince-harry-from-family-functions-in-spite-of-king-charles-wishes-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud between Prince William and Prince Harry</a>. After all, Charles and Andrew are still on speaking terms.</p>

<p>That said, the monarch and his black sheep younger brother have been butting heads for years. And it seems that the situation is now coming to a head thanks to a dispute over housing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-is-trying-to-evict-prince-andrew">King Charles Is Trying to Evict Prince Andrew</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/entertainment/prince-andrew-shoving-two-fingers-up-at-king-charles-dishonoring-royals-over-royal-lodge-standoff-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em>, Charles has been strongly urging Andrew to vacate his current residence, the Royal Lodge on the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>



<p>Andrew currently lives there with his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, and it seems the exes lack the necessary income to maintain the property.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="711" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-71247161-711x1024.jpg" alt="Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales arrive for the first day of Royal Ascot 2006, at Ascot Racecourse on June 20, 2006 in Ascot, England.

<p>Charles has proposed that they move out of the 31-room property and relocate to the much smaller Frogmore Cottage.</p>



<p>(You might remember that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle used to claim Frogmore as their own before they were <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/king-charles-of-course-i-booted-harry-and-meghan-from-frogmore-cottage-they-deserved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evicted by Charles</a>.)</p>



<p>But Andrew&#8217;s lack of income is due largely to the fact that Charles has tightened the royal purse strings.</p>



<p>He now views the king&#8217;s eviction attempt as another public humiliation. And it seems he&#8217;s drawn a line in the sand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-brotherly-dispute">A Brotherly Dispute</h2>



<p>According to royal expert Christopher Wilson, the situation is much more serious than a simple dispute over housing.</p>



<p>He believes that by refusing to vacate the house that was formerly home to the Queen Mother, Andrew is showing tremendous disrespect to his late grandmother.</p>



<p>“It’s dishonoring [the Queen Mother’s] memory,” Wilson recently told <em><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/31493383/prince-andrew-king-charles-fortune-money-royal-lodge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>.</p>



<p>“It’s shoving up two fingers at King Charles. The state of his mind is reflected in the state of his home.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1425178012-1024x683.jpg" alt="King Charles III, Anne, Princess Royal and Prince Andrew, Duke of York watch on as The Queen's funeral cortege borne on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy as it departs Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022 in London, England.

<p>Wilson says that Andrew&#8217;s disregard for his family is evidenced by the house&#8217;s disrepair.</p>



<p>“It is falling all around him,” said the journalist. “He doesn’t care anymore.”</p>



<p>But Charles does care, and he might soon double down in his efforts to convince his brother to downsize.</p>

<p>As we previously stated, Charles is no stranger to familial evictions. Amid great controversy, he removed Harry and Meghan from Frogmore last year, just one day before the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s memoir</a>.</p>



<p>With multiple sexual assault allegations against him, Andrew has certainly brought greater shame to the family.</p>



<p>And polls indicate that he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-who-is-the-most-popular-royal-of-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the least popular royal</a> by a significant margin.</p>



<p>But Charles has always seemed to have a soft spot for his brother. So don&#8217;t be surprised if this dispute drags on for a while.</p>

<p>King Charles might be gambling with death by maintaining his grueling work schedule.</p>



<p>At least that&#8217;s the claim being made by one source close to the monarch.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-heckled-by-senator-in-australia-you-are-not-our-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles paused his chemotherapy treatments</a> for recent state visits to Australia and Samoa.</p>

<p>And according to insiders, that decision might have cost him dearly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-is-dicing-with-death-says-insider">King Charles Is &#8216;Dicing With Death,&#8217; Says Insider</h2>



<p>Charles&#8217; trip was only 11 days long. But it seems that over the course of his travels, he began to show troubling signs of fatigue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although Charles is trying to show that it&#8217;s business as usual, it&#8217;s not working out that way,&#8221; a source recently told <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/ing-charles-taking-turn-for-worst-monarch-suffering-agonizing-lip-sores-fatigue-endless-grueling-chemo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>. &#8220;Anyone can see he&#8217;s not well.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="671" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-1024x671.jpg" alt="Prince Charles, Prince of Wales waves as he attends the Royal Cornwall Show on June 07, 2018 in Wadebridge, United Kingdom." class="wp-image-512707" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-1024x671.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-768x503.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-2048x1343.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-960x629.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-1080x708.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-969171828-4-1200x787.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Charles, Prince of Wales waves as he attends the Royal Cornwall Show on June 07, 2018 in Wadebridge, United Kingdom.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Tim Rooke &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The insider went so far as to claim that Charles is &#8220;dicing with death&#8221; as a result of his grueling work schedule.</p>



<p>&#8220;His sore lips have caused some people to draw back in horror,&#8221; revealed the tipster. </p>



<p>&#8220;And his complexion is raw and ruddy. His courtiers worry he&#8217;s neglecting his health by putting the kingdom first. Clearly, he&#8217;s sicker than he makes himself out to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The source claims that Charles&#8217; decline was most evident during a visit to a Sydney indigenous community center.</p>



<p>&#8220;There were whispers going around Charles seemed so very frail,&#8221; continued the insider. </p>



<p>&#8220;It looked like all he could do was just smile, shake hands, and bob his head while he let Camilla be the animated one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The source went on to state that unlike <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kate-middleton-will-continue-to-limit-stress-following-chemotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Middleton, who has completed chemotherapy</a>, Charles still has a long road ahead of him.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still receiving treatment and there is no end date, which is a red flag in itself,&#8221; said the insider. </p>



<p>&#8220;Unlike Princess Kate, who&#8217;s now in remission from her own cancer, the king is far from being given the all-clear.</p>



<p>&#8220;But he insists on cramming his schedule with more public appearances. It all seems too much too soon. He&#8217;s not looking well, and one would suspect he&#8217;s not feeling well either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Palace officials still have not revealed the nature or severity of Charles&#8217; illness.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been speculation that he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/king-charles-diagnosed-with-pancreatic-cancer-given-two-years-to-live-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battling pancreatic cancer</a>, but that remains unconfirmed.</p>



<p>Insiders say that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/prince-william-kate-middleton-preparing-for-death-of-failing-king-charles-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate and Prince William have begun preparations to accede to the throne</a> in the event of Charles&#8217; sudden death. But those reports also have not been verified.</p>
