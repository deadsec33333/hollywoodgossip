										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Amanda Stanton rose to fame as a contestant on Bachelor in Paradise.</p>
<p>Which is ironic right about now.</p>
<p>Because the reality star admits she&#8217;s living in Hell these days.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;re being a tad dramatic, but Stanton has opened up for the first time since Bobby Jacobs ended their relationship and it&#8217;s very clear she didn&#8217;t see this split coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, I want to let y&rsquo;all know I am totally fine,&rdquo; the 29-year old reality star says in her Instagram Story, adding late yesterday:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to confirm &#8211; just because it&rsquo;s already been confirmed &#8211; but I wanted you guys to hear it from me that yes, Bobby and I broke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, Jacobs himself confirmed the news before Stanton could do so, stunning fans by acknowledging that he and Stanton are no longer living together. And are no longer even a couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no cheating,&rdquo; he told followers on Friday, April 5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d always be there for the girls and I&rsquo;ve voiced that many a time. Coming from having a deadbeat Dad I&rsquo;ve chosen to live my life nothing like him. They touched my heart and vice versa. No matter what I&rsquo;ll always be around for them.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jacobs, who got to know Stanton over Instagram early last year, is referring here to Amanda&#8217;s two daughters, Kinsley and Charlie.</p>
<p>And Stanton then went ahead and did so herself in her own social media message this week, saying:</p>
<p>&quot;I want to clear the air about my kids. My kids know, no matter what, they are always my number one priority. Always. I remind them that every single day. They never feel like I&rsquo;m choosing a guy over them, and that&rsquo;s the silliest assumption about me that I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Stanton sadly found herself at the center of a hacking scandal, explaining that she&#8217;s being <a href="/videos/amanda-stanton-reveals-shes-being-blackmailed-over-topless-photo/">blackmailed over stolen topless photos</a>.</p>
<p>But Jacobs has made it clear this had nothing to do with why he ended their relationship.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I was completely blindsided [by the breakup] and it just happened very suddenly,&rdquo; Stanton continued on her Story, continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I get into it, Bobby didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, so don&rsquo;t go hating on him for it. Yes, I was surprised, but it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanton admitted that she truly thought she and Jacobs were going to get married and that moving in together in Laguna Beach was meant to be the next step in their romance.</p>
<p>Alas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a great relationship, it wasn&rsquo;t toxic,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It was actually the healthiest relationship I&rsquo;ve ever been in. He was my best friend, I was super happy and that was not fake.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Stanton says that she and her girls will remain in this residence, telling her one million-plus followers that life goes on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t waste any more of my time,&quot; she noted,&nbsp;concluding that she&#8217;s been listening &quot;to Ariana Grande nonstop&quot; and shooting down the possibility of a reconciliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think it works out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s going to happen, and that&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>After <a href="/videos/amanda-stanton-reveals-shes-being-blackmailed-over-topless-photo/">Amanda Stanton bravely revealed that she was being blackmailed</a>, fans feared that some absolute monsters would victim-blame her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were right to be nervous. Trolls are attacking Amanda, the victim, on social media.</p>
<p>But Amanda knows how to stand up for herself, and is clapping back.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Tuesday, Amanda Stanton shared a tearful message with her fans and followers.</p>
<p>Some monster has been blackmailing her &#8212; demanding large sums of money and also harassing her and her friends.</p>
<p>The perpetrator apparently got a hold of topless photos of her.</p>
<p>These pictures were from the doctor&#8217;s office, taken for medical purposes related to her breast ugmentation. They are part of her medical records.</p>
<p>Amanda felt visible relief after sharing her story and, with encouragement, she contacted police.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the blackmailer isn&#8217;t the only vicious person on the internet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;@amandastanton if you feel violated why the hell did you make topless pics,&quot; some internet goon demands to know.</p>
<p>This troll then insists that Amanda should &quot;Aim your anger at the dude or girl that took the pics.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No mercy whatsoever for you,&quot; the vicious comment declares. &quot;Go back to Nordstrom for more clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>That is &#8230; positively hateful.</p>
<p>Amanda didn&#8217;t let that accusatory tweet go unanswered, however, and she clapped back with one simple tool: the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;They were medical photos that my doctor took &#8230;&quot; Amanda responds.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Feeling much better today!&quot; Amanda wrote in her Instagram Stories to provide fans with an update.</p>
<p>&quot;Trying to stay off my phone as much as possible for the day,&quot; she shares. &quot;And just be present.&quot;</p>
<p>Amanda adds: &quot;One thing that&#8217;s really helping me is just counting my blessings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she adds. &quot;And these CBD gummies.&quot;</p>
<p>That sounds like an effective combo for relaxation and peace of mind.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Life isn&#8217;t always smooth sailing,&quot; Amanda acknowledges.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she affirms. &quot;I have so much to be thankful for.&quot;</p>
<p>She notes that her list of things for which to be thankful features her fans.</p>
<p>&quot;Including you guys!&quot; Amanda writes.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks again,&quot; she concludes. &quot;For all the love and support.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amanda has limited most of her discussion of the blackmail and harassment to her Instagram Stories and to Twitter.</p>
<p>But she made a much vaguer post to Instagram, ensuring that all of her followers can see a little of what she is experiencing.</p>
<p>&quot;The past week has been rough for me,&quot; Amanda admits.</p>
<p>&quot;I won&rsquo;t get into detail,&quot; she writes. &quot;But my anxiety is out of control.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&rsquo;ve been extremely stressed over some things that are completely out of my control,&quot; she confesses.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amanda struggles with &quot;Losing sleep, having no motivation, and just haven&rsquo;t been myself because of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As much as I know I shouldn&rsquo;t stress over things that I can&rsquo;t control,&quot; she writes. &quot;It seems impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Praying that I find peace this week,&quot; Amands says. &quot;And if anyone else is going through something similar, I&rsquo;m praying for you too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know I don&rsquo;t normally post this kind of stuff,&quot; Amanda says. &quot;But I&rsquo;m going to be more real with you guys, even if it&rsquo;s a little scary&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re glad that she feels comfortable enough to be honest with fans.</p>
<p>That takes away a tremendous amount of the blackmailer&#8217;s leverage.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just sorry that some awful people want to blame Amanda. She is the victim here &#8212; period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amanda Stanton is a former <em>The Bachelor</em> contestant and <a href="/2019/01/amanda-stanton-mom-shamed-for-letting-daughter-do-this/">a loving mom</a>. But her fame has made her the target of a terrible crime.</p>
<p>In a tearful message, Amanda has revealed that some monster has been trying to blackmail and extort her.</p>
<p>The blackmailer allegedly acquired photos of her from her breast augmentation and threatened to share them with the world.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Across a series of 18 emotionally devastating videos in her Instagram Stories uploaded on Tuesday, Amanda Stanton shares her private torment.</p>
<p>(For your viewing convenience, we have merged those 18 videos in order for you and included it within this post)</p>
<p>She also exposes the person who has been trying to ruin her life.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wanted to come on here and tell you guys a little bit about what&#8217;s going on,&quot; Amanda begins.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not a big deal,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#8217;s a little crazy, but we&#8217;re all healthy.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, people dismiss their own problems because they know that someone else always has it worse.</p>
<p>We assure you that this is <em>definitely</em> a big deal.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;About three weeks ago, when we first moved into our new place, I woke up randomly during the night and looked at my email,&quot; she shares.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she continues. &quot;I had about four emails from a random person whom I didn&#8217;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>Amanda says that these emails were from someone &quot;who said that he had hacked my doctor&#8217;s database from when I had my breast augmentation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that he had some nude photos of me from the doctor&#8217;s office,&quot; she reveals.</p>
<p>&quot;Which is just stupid,&quot; she notes. &quot;Because they&#8217;re medical photos.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;He was basically asking for a lot of money,&quot; Amanda shares. &quot;And threatening to send the photos to everybody that I follow.&quot;</p>
<p>She says that he had made a list of her social media contacts, and even sent some messages to others to demonstrate that he meant business.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she adds, he was &quot;sending me really weird messages and harassing me every single day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He sent them to my friend&#8217;s boyfriend,&quot; she lists. &quot;He sent them to people I work with, he sent them to producers at ABC.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it was just out of my control,&quot; Amanda laments. &quot;There was nothing I could do about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; she explains. &quot;I figured that I might as well address it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve had&nbsp;a lot of people text me and DM me that they have received the messages from him,&quot; Amanda notes.</p>
<p>&quot;And I just want to say thank you,&quot; she expresses. &quot;I&#8217;m sorry that I haven&#8217;t responded to everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>Amanda explains: &quot;It&#8217;s just been hard explaining the story so many times.&quot;</p>
<p>At this point, her voice begins to break and she is tearing up as she relives this nightmare for her followers.</p>
<p>&quot;I just don&#8217;t wanna give somebody like that power over me,&quot; she shares.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she adds. &quot;I hope that maybe by just addressing it, that he&#8217;ll stop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you get the photos,&quot; Amanda asks through tears. &quot;I just hope that you will be respectful and understand that it&#8217;s been really hard for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she implores anyone listening. &quot;Just keep them private.&quot;</p>
<p>She then thanks her fans and followers for their continued support.</p>
<p>Amanda acknowledges that it&#8217;s &quot;not the end of the world if people see my boobs.&quot;</p>
<p>She expresses that she feels frustrated and &quot;very violated,&quot; which are extremely reasonable emotions to feel under the circumstances.</p>
<p>And she reveals that, on top of the harassment, she doesn&#8217;t know what other information her blackmailer may possess.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s not the end of this story &#8212; that&#8217;s only 12 videos in.</p>
<p>Amanda returned to her Stories some time later, feeling much more upbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; she shares. &quot;So, good news: the hacker has left me alone since I&#8217;ve posted that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it hasn&#8217;t been a long time,&quot; Amanda acknowledges. &quot;He&#8217;s probably going to message me again tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For all of you guys telling me to contact the police,&quot; Amanda says. &quot;I have already done that.&quot;</p>
<p>She reiterates her hope that the person who has harassed and blackmailed her will no longer trouble her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amanda is not the first celebrity to be targeted by a hacker who claims to have her nudes.</p>
<p>Sadly, she will probably not be the last.</p>
<p>Usually, victim-blamers try to accuse these women for being foolish for having these photos in the first place.</p>
<p>(We wonder if they would say that same if someone&#8217;s vehicle or television were stolen)</p>
<p>In this case, they were medical photos taken at the doctor&#8217;s office. Even the vilest victim-blamer may struggle to find fault with her there.</p>
<p>We hope that justice comes swiftly to this monster who has been trying to ruin her life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Amanda Stanton is open with fans about many things, whether she&#8217;s <a href="/2018/01/amanda-stanton-talks-robby-hayes-josh-murray-and-becoming-the-ba/">discussing her exes</a> or her <a href="/2018/12/amanda-stanton-domestic-battery-charges-dismissed/">(dropped) domestic battery charges</a>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s so open with fans that she did a poll on whether she should let her daughter make a major change to her appearance.</p>
<p>When she didn&#8217;t follow the poll&#8217;s results, some fans mom-shamed her over it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amanda Stanton asked her fans and followers if she should allow her first-grader, Kinsley, to get highlights.</p>
<p>&quot;How can I say no to this face?&quot; Amanda asked, sharing an image of her adorable daughter.</p>
<p>As a joke, she even made a poll.</p>
<p>Obviously, she was not actually trying to crowdsource her parenting advice.</p>
<p>Kinsley has a mom, not a <em>mob</em>.</p>
<p>Amanda then shared a photo of Kinsley, which you can see above, captioning it: &quot;Babe&#8217;s first highlights.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kinsley looks adorable with the very subtle change to her hair.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lovely mother-daughter bonding activity.</p>
<p>However, some of Amanda&#8217;s fans were incensed.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you do polls if you don&#8217;t even listen to the outcome,&quot; asked one truly absurd follower.</p>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; Amanda replied. &quot;I value you guys&#8217; opinion and do like to hear what you guys have to say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But ultimately,&quot; she actually had to explain. &quot;It&#8217;s my decision, regardless of whatever wins the poll.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Amanda had more to say, but first, we have to show you an extreme example of the kind of mom-shaming nonsense that she received.</p>
<p>&quot;Has to stop babying her children or they are never gonna grow up,&quot; writes a deranged commenter.</p>
<p>This is in response to the photo at the top of the article, in which Amanda is (gasp) holding her daughter for a photo.</p>
<p>&quot;Too old to be carrying them and coddling them all the time,&quot; the bonkers comment continues.</p>
<p>&quot;But then,&quot; the loony words conclude. &quot;Lets them damage their hair. Really?&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that said commenter has never been allowed within 50 feet of any child. Or adult.</p>
<p>Most of the mom-shaming comments were more about the highlights themselves.</p>
<p>Some insisted that Amanda was ruining her child&#8217;s hair for life.</p>
<p>Others said that it was too grown up and generally made arguments similar to those that people make when they whine about girls wearing makeup.</p>
<p>But, as Amanda revealed, it was all expected.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Confession,&quot; Amanda began another post on her Instagram Story.</p>
<p>&quot;When I posted the poll about getting Kin&rsquo;s hair (HARDLY) highlighted,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I knew it would trigger the trolls.&quot;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t love the use of the word <em>trigger </em>here, but it&#8217;s sadly become all-too-common internet parlance.</p>
<p>(Obviously, we don&#8217;t think that Amanda Stanton is making fun of actual people with PTSD or OCD)</p>
<p>&quot;But I did it anyway,&quot; Amanda continued. &quot;So in a way I was trolling the trolls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I got some messages saying she&rsquo;s too young etc,&quot; she admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she noted. &quot;I got a lot more saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you let her and didn&rsquo;t care what anyone negative had to say.&rsquo;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-808x1024.png" alt="Amanda Stanton Shines" class="wp-image-308524" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-808x1024.png 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-237x300.png 237w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-768x974.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-735x932.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-264x335.png 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-274x347.png 274w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-410x520.png 410w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-505x640.png 505w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-606x768.png 606w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines-757x960.png 757w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shines.png 844w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;So, moral of the story is,&rdquo; Amanda continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not everyone is going to agree with everything you do &hellip; &amp; that&rsquo;s okay!&quot; she affirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;We all are entitled to our own decisions and opinions and thoughts on parenting etc,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she concluded. &quot;Not everyone is going to agree with you and that&rsquo;s OKAY.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, if a parent is doing something harmful, that&#8217;s different &#8212; but not relevant to Amanda&#8217;s situation.</p>
<p>She literally just let her daughter get highlights. Chill, folks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>In September, <a href="/2018/09/amanda-stanton-arrested-for-domestic-violence-see-her-mug-shot/">Amanda Stanton was arrested for domestic battery</a> against her boyfriend, Bobby Jacobs.</p>
<p>Though even misdemeanor domestic violence is serious, Amanda insisted that it was just a huge misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Now, the charges against her have been dismissed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Clark County District Attorney&#8217;s office tells <a href="https://www.etonline.com/bachelor-alum-amanda-stantons-domestic-violence-case-dismissed-115680"><em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a> that the domestic violence case against Amanda Stanton has been dismissed.</p>
<p>Amanda was arrested in September.</p>
<p>The arrest followed some sort of altercation with her boyfriend, Bobby Jacobs.</p>
<p>After the incident went down in a Las Vegas hotel room, Amanda was arrested on a charge of&nbsp;misdemeanor battery domestic violence.</p>
<p>At the time, she entered a plea of not guilty.</p>
<p>Now, she has shaken off the charge and shared this photo of her with Bobby Jacobs, showing that they&#8217;re happily still together.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Domestic violence can take many forms, but all are serious.</p>
<p>In this case, hotel security were called to a room over a noise complaint.</p>
<p>This is where Amanda allegedly walked up to Bobby and shoved him.</p>
<p>The alleged shove was hard enough that hotel security contacted police.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, police found sufficient evidence to arrest Amanda on the misdemeanor charge.</p>
<p>However, according to a statement released by Amanda&#8217;s rep, this whole situation may be a simple misunderstanding.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="/2018/09/amanda-stanton-shares-her-side-of-shocking-battery-arrest/">Amanda Stanton shared her side of the story</a> through her rep.</p>
<p>&quot;Amanda is embarrassed and ashamed this happened,&quot; the statement begins.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; the statement continues, Amanda &quot;sincerely apologizes to hotel security and the Las Vegas Police Department.&quot;</p>
<p>For the inconvenience of having arrested her, we imagine.</p>
<p>&quot;Amanda is a gentle, respectful person,&quot; the statement says.</p>
<p>She is described as someone &quot;who has never gotten physical with anyone under any circumstance.&quot;</p>
<p>To clarify, they mean physically <em>violent</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We have to hand it to Team Amanda, because this statement strikes <em>exactly </em>the right tone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely remorseful yet presents it all as a misunderstanding &#8212; but also blames absolutely no one.</p>
<p>&quot;That evening,&quot; the statement continues. &quot;She had a few drinks at a bachelorette party.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; the rep says. &quot;When hotel security asked her and Bobby to quiet down, she got a bit rambunctious.&quot;</p>
<p>Hotel security was apparently responding to a noise complaint.</p>
<p>&quot;Amanda gave Bobby what she thought was a playful shove;&quot; the rep explains.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Hotel security did their job and reported the incident to the police,&quot; the statement reads.</p>
<p>Of the police, the statement then says: &quot;who in turn did their job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite Bobby explaining this was not an ill-intended shove,&quot; the rep reports. &quot;The police still had to do their job.&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of jobs seem to be getting performed in this statement.</p>
<p>This is a decision &quot;which Amanda completely respects and understands.&quot;</p>
<p>In Vegas, as in many other placs, police responding to a domestic battery call must arrest one party or the other.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Domestic violence is no joke under any circumstances.</p>
<p>We hope that the facts that the charges have been dropped and Bobby is still with her means that this was, truly, a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(Charges being dropped in and of themselves do not always mean much, as we have all seen with very real domestic abusers)</p>
<p>A lot of people adore Amanda and would hate to believe that she&#8217;s not the person they thought she was.</p>
<p>We hope that the Bachelor Nation can learn from this.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t shove your partner, even playfully.</p>
<p>A lot of people will take it seriously because it&#8217;s their job to take it seriously.</p>
