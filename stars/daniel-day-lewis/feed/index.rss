<p>In a surprising turn of events on Tuesday, the Oscar-winning star of such films as Lincoln and My Left Foot announced he is retiring from acting.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>

<p>In a statement, Day-Lewis&rsquo; spokeswoman, Leslee Dart, <a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/daniel-day-lewis-quits-acting-oscar-winner-1202472766/">confirmed the news to Variety</a>, telling the Hollywood news outlet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.&quot;</p>
<p>No further statement and no other reasons for the star&#8217;s retirement were provided.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old star has already finished shooting &ldquo;Phantom Thread,&rdquo; a drama set in the world of high fashion that is scheduled to hit theaters on December 25, 2017.</p>
<p>It will reunite him with long-time collaborator Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>

<p>Anderson also directed Day-Lewis to a Best Actor Academy Award victory for 2007&rsquo;s &ldquo;There Will Be Blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to someone close to Day-Lewis, he does intend to help promote the movie later this year.</p>
<p>Day-Lewis has won a total of three Best Actor trophies; for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.</p>
<p>He garnered two other Academy Award nominations for Gangs of New York and In the Name of the Father and has long been known as one of true &quot;method&quot; actors in Hollywood.</p>
<p>That is, Day-Lewis typically continues to play his movie character even when the cameras stop rolling, continuing to act as Abraham Lincoln, for example, on set throughout the day.</p>
<p>His impressive resume is chock full of unique roles and movies, from Nine to The Last of the Mohicans to The Age of Innocence.</p>

<p>According to the same Variety article that confirmed his retirement, Day-Lewis learned Czech in order to portray a philandering doctor in The Unbearable Lightness of Being and listened to Eminem songs to channel rage in Gangs of New York.</p>
<p>Heck, he confined himself to a wheelchair for My Left Foot to play someone who suffered from cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>Day-Lewis has three children and is married to writer and director Rebecca Miller.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll miss him on the big screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Gabe Day is a &quot;bipolar stoop kid taking care of biz.&quot; Or so the 18-year-old son of Daniel Day-Lewis claims in his new music video for &quot;Green Auras.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/gabe-day-lewis-green-auras"></a></figure>
<p>Gabe attends Sarah Lawrence College near New York City and is a rapper, produced by artist J. Cole, who just released the music video for the track.</p>
<p>He <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/daniel-day-lewis-son-gabe-day-raps-about-famous-father-drug-trips-being-bipolar-20131911">covers a host of topics</a>, including his feelings about his father.</p>
<p>&quot;Call me Gabe Day and not Gabe Day-Lewis,&quot; he raps.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause if you&#8217;re trying to call me out, I&#8217;m going to Gabe Day-Lose It! I know what my name is and I know what fame is. Judging someone for their dad is just as bad as being racist.&quot;</p>
<p>Alright then.</p>
<p>Throughout the video, Day appears to be smoking weed, and even explains at one point with the lyrics, &quot;self-medicated cause my heart and my throat hurt.&quot;</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Day is the son of French actress Isabelle Adjani, with whom Daniel was in a relationship for six years, but whom he left in 1995 before their son was born.</p>
<p>He then moved on to Deya Pichardo, and when Adjani heard that he had married, she called Pichardo to congratulate her &#8230; only she was not the wife.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Pichardo or Adjani, the British actor had wed Arthur Miller&#8217;s daughter, director Rebecca Miller, while filming Miller&#8217;s <em>The Crucible</em>.</p>
<p>The couple is still married and has two younger sons.</p>
<p>Gabe addressed his mother&#8217;s loss in the rap, spouting, &quot;I feel the most grief for my mother who has no one left in her life but me and my older brother.&quot;</p>
<p>He also discussed his personal struggles, at length.</p>
<p>&quot;I find out that I&#8217;m bipolar, now I wear it like a badge. I was on a bad path. I did too many drugs. Felt like coping on my own when all I needed was a hug.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a bad trip, reevaluated my life,&quot; he continues.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank god I survived, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s easier to smile.&quot;</p>
<p>Amen, Gabe Day (not Gabe Day-Lewis).</p>
