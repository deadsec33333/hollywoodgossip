<p>Wendy Williams have once again spoken her mind.</p>



<p>Her mind, we should note, that the former talk show host swears is sound and reasonable and in perfectly good shape.</p>



<p>On March 21, while dining with friends in Manhattan, Williams gave a couple of minutes to Page Six and said she does not deserve to be held by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wendy-williams-labeled-permanently-disabled-and-incapacitated-by-guardian/">a court-ordered guardianship</a>.</p>

<p>“I am fabulous. I’m better than good, but have been accused to being otherwise,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/22/celebrity-news/inside-wendy-williams-lockdown-nightmare-as-she-reveals-she-deserves-freedom/">Williams told</a> the aforementioned outlet late last week. “I am very much alive. I deserve freedom, darling.”</p>



<p>When asked about the guardianship she’s been held under since 2022 &#8212; as a result of alleged mental deterioration related to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-denies-dementia-diagnosis-i-havent-been-allowed-to-see-a-doctor-in-years/">a diagnosis of dementia</a> &#8212; Williams directed the newspaper to her advocate, Ginalisa Monterroso.</p>



<p>“Don’t believe everything you read,&#8221; this individual simply said to Page Six.</p>



<p>That was the extent of what we heard from Williams in this instance.</p>

<p>At the time, she gave her side of the story to an incident this month during which Wendy was seen <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-begs-for-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begging for help</a> from paparazzi and the  being whisked away in an ambulance to (reportedly) pass a cognitive evaluation.</p>



<p>“I needed a breath of fresh air. I needed to see the doctor,” Wendy explained on The View. “So that’s why I went to the hospital.”</p>



<p>Added Williams: “It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation. Which, I don’t have it!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-1024x681.jpg" alt="Wendy Williams attends the Apple TV+'s &quot;The Morning Show&quot; World Premiere at David Geffen Hall on October 28, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-519498" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-960x638.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-1080x718.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1184077839-1-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Williams attends the Apple TV+&#8217;s &#8220;The Morning Show&#8221; World Premiere at David Geffen Hall on October 28, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On March 1, meanwhile, Williams’ former longtime producer Suzanne Bass described the guardianship as “terrible.”</p>



<p>“You guys have been asking me for years if I’ve heard from Wendy, and what I’m doing to help Wendy,” Bass said in a video posted to Instagram on February 28.</p>



<p>“I’m gonna be honest,” she added. “I hadn’t heard from Wendy in years until last week. My phone rang, and it was Wendy. I cried, she cried, Brendan cried, Jack was home, my oldest, he didn’t cry, but he said I had to work.”</p>



<p>Friends and associates have been divided for awhile on whether or not Williams has ongoing progressive neurological problems or if her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-punished-for-getting-drunk-at-assisted-living-facility-report/">years of drinking</a> could have caused a condition that mimics dementia.</p>

<p>“I am a college-educated woman, global international person from radio to television,” Williams  also said in her phone interview with The View panelists.</p>



<p>“I’ve been doing important things all of my life and these two people don’t look like me, they don’t dress like me, they don’t talk like me, they don’t act like me… </p>



<p>&#8220;They will never be me. I need them to — with my knees — get off my neck. I can’t do it with these two people again. I can’t. And I’m speaking of the guardians and the judge.&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams <em>was</em> diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and dementia in 2023, but she maintains that the diagnosis is false and she’s fine.</p>

<p>Wendy Williams is speaking out.</p>



<p>Just days after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-begs-for-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begging for help</a> from paparazzi and being whisked away in an ambulance to (apparently) pass a cognitive evaluation, she&#8217;s giving an interview.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t Wendy chatting on the street. She spoke on <em>The View</em>.</p>



<p>The talk show legend detailed her brief experience of freedom, the results of her psych test, and her frustration with her &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-punished-for-getting-drunk-at-assisted-living-facility-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxury prison</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-wendy-williams-doing-after-her-hospital-trip">How is Wendy Williams doing after her hospital trip?</h2>



<p>Wendy Williams called in for a pre-taped interview on the Friday, March 14 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4cdMpP5hs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <em>The View</em>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, she had a lot to say and was adamant about it. And that&#8217;s good, because the panelists of <em>The View</em> had a lot of questions.</p>



<p>&#8220;I needed a breath of fresh air. I needed to see the doctor,&#8221; Wendy explained. &#8220;So that’s why I went to the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>Williams detailed that she had undergone bloodwork, for her thyroid. She has previously complained about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-denies-dementia-diagnosis-i-havent-been-allowed-to-see-a-doctor-in-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not getting to see a doctor</a> in years without someone else making the decision.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;Which, I don’t have it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams went on to lament: “How dare they say I have incapacitation. I do not!” While Joy Behar is not a neurologist, she did offer her opinion that Wendy Williams sounded just fine to her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-after-the-hospital-wendy-williams-went-out-to-dinner">After the hospital, Wendy Williams went out to dinner</h2>



<p>Ana Navarro then asked Wendy Williams about how she went out to dinner the same night as her hospital trip with niece Alex Finnie. </p>



<p>“It was great at first… They got me at the hospital, and then &#8212; with permission from the guardian, of course &#8212; we left the hospital by ambulance,&#8221; the talk show legend described. &#8220;And we stayed [at the living facility] for about an hour, because we knew were going out to eat, just to celebrate life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams detailed: “We went to Tucci, great dinner! There were paparazzi, so we stopped. That’s what I do. I stopped, posed, and these two people that work here… they’re downstairs waiting for me.&#8221; Uh oh!</p>

<p>“I’m not permitted to do anything, but stay on this floor, memory unit,&#8221; Wendy Williams then summarized.</p>



<p>She went on to point out that the unit for those with memory problems is mostly for elderly patients, some of whom she describes as being 90 years old.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 60!&#8221; Williams pointed out. &#8220;Why am I here?!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-all-very-complex">This is all very complex</h2>



<p>Obviously, we all want what&#8217;s best for Wendy Williams. But there are reasonable questions about just what that looks like.</p>



<p>We only have her account on her cognitive evaluation. And in some cases of dementia and dementia-like symptoms, an evaluation on a &#8220;good day&#8221; only provides part of the answer.</p>



<p>That said, so much about Williams&#8217; decline and legal (and financial) situation has been deeply unusual.</p>



<p>It is always worth reevaluation. In general, legal guardianships are not for adults who can coherently protest against the arrangement.</p>

<p>Wendy Williams is pleading for help.</p>



<p>Although her legal guardian declared her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wendy-williams-labeled-permanently-disabled-and-incapacitated-by-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;permanently disabled&#8221;</a> due to her apparent mental decline, the former talk show has railed against her diagnosis.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s in an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/wendy-williams-conservatorship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assisted living facility</a> and she&#8217;s not happy with any part of her situation.</p>



<p>Now, she has begged the paparazzi for help using a handwritten note.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-begged-the-paparazzi-to-help-her">Wendy Williams begged the paparazzi to  help her</h2>



<p>On Monday, March 10, New York City police performed a wellness check on Wendy Williams.</p>



<p>Paparazzi had been photographing her through the window of the assisted living facility where she currently resides against her will.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/10/celebrity-news/wendy-williams-begs-for-help-from-assisted-living-prison-prompts-police-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a></em> reports that Wendy had dropped a handwritten note to one paparazzo. The simple note read: &#8220;Help! Wendy!!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the time of her attempt to reach out for help, Wendy wore a white tee shirt, black leggings, and gold jewelry.</p>



<p>From the angle at which the photographers were snapping pics, she appeared to have access to a phone.</p>



<p>She made faces and even smiled at the photographers. Though police performed a welfare check, it does not appear that Williams&#8217; status has changed as a result.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-wishes-to-live-independently">Wendy Williams wishes to live independently</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Wendy fired her court-appointed attorney. She has also claimed in court that she does not require her legal guardian, Sabrina Morrissey.</p>



<p>As we know, she has adamantly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-denies-dementia-diagnosis-i-havent-been-allowed-to-see-a-doctor-in-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied her dementia diagnosis</a>. It is her belief that she has recovered from any previous cognitive impairments.</p>



<p>As such, Wendy has asked the court to end the guardianship.</p>

<p>It is clear that Wendy <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-punished-for-getting-drunk-at-assisted-living-facility-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is having a miserable time</a> at the assisted living facility. </p>



<p>Most of the 60-year-old&#8217;s neighbors are elderly. She does not seem to be socializing with them or finding much in common with them.</p>



<p>Based upon her interviews, it seems that she feels like the rest of the move is moving on without her while she remains in isolation. And that is not an unfair assessment of the situation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-can-t-people-help-her">Why can&#8217;t people help her?</h2>



<p>It is important to remember that the Free Britney movement took <em>literal years</em> of intense pressure to liberate Britney Spears. Britney was a 40-year-old woman with multiple known sinister figures in her life, whose most outlandish behavior in many years has been some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/britney-spears-dances-justin-timberlake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goofy Instagram posts</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, people watched Wendy&#8217;s decline on television, in interviews, and on a harrowing documentary.</p>



<p>Wendy is also a couple of decades older than Britney. Combined with her alleged alcohol abuse and other factors, it is <em>possible </em>that she actually needs a guardianship. Or, at the very least, it&#8217;s less unreasonable for a court to believe so.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="676" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-1024x676.png" alt="Wendy Williams Backstage" class="wp-image-328744" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-1024x676.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-300x198.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-768x507.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-735x485.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-335x221.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-347x229.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-520x343.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-640x422.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-960x633.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage-1080x713.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/wendy-williams-backstage.png 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Williams spoke to the camera backstage on her show, and accidentally referred to the wrong day of the week.

<p>Conservatorships do exist for a reason. And it is not always a bad reason.</p>



<p>According to some human rights experts, these legal guardianships (and there are different forms) are generally geared toward people who may struggle to know what day it is or even where they are.</p>



<p>Judging by her own statements, Wendy clearly knows where she is. If an evaluation determines that she is consistently aware of her location and unhappy with it &#8212; that asking for help was not a sudden impulse or part of some brief flash of clarity &#8212; then perhaps she is in the wrong place. </p>



<p>But, for now, none of us know for sure.</p>

<p>Wendy Williams’ health battle has taken a turn for the much, much worse.</p>



<p>Nine months after we learned that the former talk show host had been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/">diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia</a> and frontotemporal dementia &#8212; a condition that impacts the star&#8217;s communication abilities and cognitive functions &#8212; a new legal filing confirms her health has continued to decline.</p>



<p>In significant fashion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="857" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-1024x857.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-1024x857.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-300x251.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-768x643.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-2048x1714.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-960x803.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-1080x904.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1207635111-1200x1004.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Williams attends Spotify x Cash Money Host Premiere of mini-documentary New Cash Order at Lightbox on February 20, 2020 in New York, New York. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to a legal filing obtained by TMZ and other celebrity gossip outlets, Wendy’s guardian (Sabrina E. Morrissey) says the 60-year-old &#8220;has been afflicted by early-onset dementia and, as a result, has become cognitively impaired and permanently incapacitated.&#8221;</p>



<p>The update comes amid Morrissey&#8217;s ongoing legal battle with A&amp;E Television Networks, Lifetime Entertainment and other affiliates involved with the release of Where Is Wendy Williams?, a program about TV personality&#8217;s guardianship, health diagnoses and life after The Wendy Williams Show.</p>



<p>&#8220;This case arises from the brutally calculated, deliberate actions of powerful and cravenly opportunistic media companies working together with a producer to knowingly exploit [Williams],&#8221; the documents read, referencing the aforementioned diagnosis. </p>



<p>&#8220;FTD is a progressive disease, meaning that there is no cure and the symptoms only get worse over time.”</p>

<p>About three months ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/wendy-williams-spotted-for-first-time-in-over-a-year/">Williams made her first public appearance</a> in over a year after her retreat from the spotlight following the end of her talk show in 2022.</p>



<p>At the time, she visited a holistic wellness store in her home state of New Jersey&#8230; accompanied by her 24-year-old son.</p>



<p>The celebrity&#8217;s court-ordered guardianship, meanwhile, began in April 2022 following Williams&#8217; ongoing health issues with Graves&#8217; disease, lymphedema, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-son-my-mom-drank-so-much-she-got-dementia/">and alcohol abuse</a>. </p>



<p>She was later placed in a care facility, with limited contact with her family, sources indicated back then.</p>



<p>“I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia,” Williams said in a statement this past February.</p>



<p>She continued:</p>



<p>“Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.</p>



<p>“The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="853" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-1024x853.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513973" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-1024x853.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-300x250.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-768x640.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-2048x1706.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-960x800.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-1080x900.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1181695910-1200x1000.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Williams attends her being honored with a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 17, 2019 in Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Upon revealing Wendy&#8217;s diagnosis to the public, her team delved into their reasoning behind for doing so.</p>



<p>&#8220;The decision to share this news was difficult and made after careful consideration, not only to advocate for understanding and compassion for Wendy,&#8221; the former talk show host’s reps said in a February 22 press release, &#8220;but to raise awareness about aphasia and frontotemporal dementia and support the thousands of others facing similar circumstances.&#8221;</p>



<p>The message went on:</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, many individuals diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia face stigma and misunderstanding, particularly when they begin to exhibit behavioral changes but have not yet received a diagnosis.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most importantly she maintains her trademark sense of humor and is receiving the care she requires to make sure she is protected and that her needs are addressed. She is appreciative of the many kind thoughts and good wishes being sent her way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was reportedly with her son and looked &#8220;sharp, upbeat, aware and very bubbly,&#8221; an employee at this establishment <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/26/celebrity-news/upbeat-wendy-williams-spotted-for-the-first-time-in-more-than-a-year/">told the aforementioned publication</a>.</p>



<p>This description is noteworthy because Wendy&#8217;s health care team shared about six months ago that she had been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/">diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia</a> and frontotemporal dementia&#8230; neurological syndromes that impact speech and cognitive functions.</p>



<p>“I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD),&#8221; Williams said in a statement this past February, adding at the time:</p>



<p>“Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.</p>



<p>“The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="680" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-680x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508097" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-768x1156.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-1361x2048.jpg 1361w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-638x960.jpg 638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-717x1080.jpg 717w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-797x1200.jpg 797w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1184058867-scaled.jpg 1701w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Williams attends the Apple TV+&#8217;s &#8220;The Morning Show&#8221; World Premiere at David Geffen Hall on October 28, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 60-year old hasn&#8217;t been seen out or about in over a year &#8212; and may never be close to the same as she once was, unfortunately.</p>



<p>In this new case, she “engaging but wasn’t as familiar with what we do here, so her son was more explaining things,” the worker told Page Six.</p>



<p>“She talked about circulation improvement, but didn’t want to get into too much detail on their first meeting and plans to come back in the near future.”</p>



<p>The employee went on to say that Williams left the store with several holistic products, including iron-rich herbs such as sarsaparilla, contribo and bottano oil, which they told us is “big for skin.”</p>

<p>Back to Wendy&#8217;s deteriorating condition, as her team said on February 22 of what they disclosed regarding their client/patient:</p>



<p>&#8220;The decision to share this news was difficult and made after careful consideration, not only to advocate for understanding and compassion for Wendy, but to raise awareness about aphasia and frontotemporal dementia and support the thousands of others facing similar circumstances.&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams had previously been candid about her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/">battle with Graves Disease</a>.</p>



<p>She lasted hosted her talk show in June 2022.</p>

<p>In general, alhough Wendy&#8217;s disorders have &#8220;already presented significant hurdles in Wendy&#8217;s life,&#8221; the star &#8220;maintains her trademark sense of humor and is receiving the care she requires to make sure she is protected and that her needs are addressed,&#8221; according to her team.</p>



<p>They concluded this winter:</p>



<p>&#8220;Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wendy Williams is a living legend. And she has also essentially vanished.</p>



<p>The harrowing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-publicist-shawn-zanotti-docuseries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> docuseries</a> addressed the fallen daytime host&#8217;s many struggles. But some of those closest to her are asking the question more literally: <em>where is she</em>?</p>



<p>Even Wendy&#8217;s longtime best friend doesn&#8217;t seem to know.</p>



<p>From finances to enduring radio silence to the welfare of Wendy&#8217;s pets, there are a <em>lot </em>of questions and concerns about Wendy&#8217;s current state of affairs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-is-a-real-person-not-just-an-entertainer-not-just-a-meme">Wendy Williams is a real person, not just an entertainer, not just a meme</h2>



<p>Regina Schell is Wendy Williams&#8217; best friend of 44 years. She was living with her in 2022, when it became clear that Wendy was going to lose her show forever.</p>



<p>Speaking to <em>The US Sun</em> in her first long-form interview (ever), Regina <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/11538335/wendy-williams-best-friend-forced-silence-vanishing-public/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed Wendy Williams</a> and how what she means to <em>her </em>differs from how some on the internet perceive her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want people to know that Wendy is a real person, and this is not some karma is a b&#8211;ch thing,&#8221; Regina emphasized.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Wendy Williams smiles in December of 2019." class="wp-image-501412" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0606_wendywilliams_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Wendy Williams attends the 2019 NYWIFT Muse Awards at the New York Hilton Midtown on December 10, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Lars Niki/Getty Images for New York Women in Film &amp;amp; Television)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Recently, Wendy Williams has been largely radio silent. That is setting off alarm bells for Regina.</p>



<p>&#8220;Talking is Wendy&#8217;s life, her whole claim to fame is talking,&#8221; she pointed out.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Regina then reasoned, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think she would be this quiet unless she [were] forced to be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-guardianship-keeping-wendy-william-silent">Is the guardianship keeping Wendy William silent?</h2>



<p>Wendy Williams effectively vanished from the public in May of 2023. Before that, she had been very vocal about her dislike of the conservator situation.</p>



<p>Most memorably, Lifetime came out with <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> in February of 2024. And yet the world didn&#8217;t get to hear Wendy&#8217;s thoughts on the matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no way in hell that she would not have responded to that Lifetime documentary, with all her family members appearing in it,&#8221; an inside source noted to <em>The US Sun</em>. &#8220;Wendy would have had something to say about all of that, without a doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regina went on to wonder about her bestie&#8217;s disappearance. Lifetime&#8217;s documentary did not answer the question &#8212; not when it aired in 2024, that is.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where is Wendy and why is no one asking that question? And why is no one answering that question?&#8221; she demanded.</p>



<p>Regina reiterated: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t they produce Wendy, or an actual statement from Wendy, or a picture of Wendy? Where is Wendy?!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-has-vanished-from-friends-lives-not-just-the-public-eye">Wendy WIlliams has vanished from friends&#8217; lives, not just the public eye</h2>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t spoken to my friend, who I spoke to five times a day, in over a year now,&#8221; Regina declared. Many of us who speak to loved ones every single day can understand her state of mind. And these two also <em>lived </em>together.</p>



<p>&#8220;I stayed with Wendy on and off for that entire summer, from June of 2022 until August,&#8221; Regina specified. &#8220;I left and I went home briefly and came back in September, and then she came out to California in October and I went back to New York in December.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then added: &#8220;I spent the majority of the year with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like many in Wendy&#8217;s family, Regina has concerns about the daytime TV legend&#8217;s emotional support.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think she should be surrounded by family and friends and people who love and support her, instead of some stranger who has her who knows where,&#8221; she expressed.</p>



<p>As for Wendy&#8217;s mysterious whereabouts, Regina theorized: &#8220;She&#8217;s somewhere that she can&#8217;t reach a phone because Wendy can always get to a phone, because if she could get to a phone, she&#8217;d be calling me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-wendy-s-money">What about Wendy&#8217;s money?</h2>



<p>Another worry, in Regina&#8217;s mind, is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams&#8217; dwindling finances</a>. There have been questions about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/wendy-williams-ex-husband-kevin-hunter-alimony-backpay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy&#8217;s money under the guardianship</a> before.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is the end game? How does this end when her money is gone? Where is she?&#8221; Regina emphasized.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got a sinister vibe to it. That&#8217;s what gets me,&#8221; she then expressed. &#8220;There&#8217;s something about it that just doesn&#8217;t feel right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regina added: &#8220;There&#8217;s no sign of her beyond a statement that was made which doesn&#8217;t sound like her at all, and why hasn&#8217;t a medical team come forward to talk about her dementia diagnosis?&#8221;</p>



<p>Previously, Regina has spoken out about Wendy&#8217;s guardian allegedly taking &#8220;hours&#8221; to provide her with food &#8212; and having similar delays with Wendy&#8217;s cats, Chit Chat and My Way. Regina doesn&#8217;t know the fate of the felines, either.</p>



<p>We all hope that all of these questions and concerns have positive answers and innocuous explanations. But the world, like Regina, would really like to understand Wendy&#8217;s situation.</p>

<p>Wendy Williams&#8217; ex wants her money &#8212; and to see her banking records.</p>



<p>In February, the <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> docuseries introduced the world to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-publicist-shawn-zanotti-docuseries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams&#8217; inner circle</a> as she experiences struggles with her health and finances.</p>

<p>Her ex-husband, Kevin Hunter, says that she owes him two years&#8217; worth of unpaid alimony.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-hunter-and-wendy-williams-are-divorced">Kevin Hunter and Wendy Williams are divorced</h2>



<p>In April of 2019, Wendy Williams filed for divorce. The two had married in 1999.</p>



<p>Though she cited &#8220;irreconsilable differences&#8221; as the reason for ending their two decades of marriage, her husband had grown more brazen in his extramarital relationship. To the point where he had fathered a child with his mistress.</p>



<p>Williams and Hunter finalized their divorce in January of 2020.</p>

<p>According to a report by <em>The US Sun</em>, Kevin Hunter is now <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/10687355/wendy-williams-ex-kevin-hunter-demands-divorce-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanding payments from Wendy Williams</a>. In his filing, Hunter claims that he&#8217;s not demanding anything more than the couple agreed to in their Marital Settlement Agreement.</p>



<p>Hunter says that the alimony payments abruptly ceased in 2022, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-guardianship-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams received a legal guardianship</a>.</p>



<p>It seems that he first tried out-of-court mediation. However, that has failed, and he is bringing the case to court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-hunter-depends-upon-payments-from-wendy-williams">Kevin Hunter depends upon payments from Wendy Williams</h2>



<p>&#8220;I rely on the severance pay for my living expenses,&#8221; Hunter told the court. &#8220;And having been without this income for twenty-three months has affected me greatly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hunter is also asking ex-wife&#8217;s guardianship to &#8220;immediately pay all severance payments which may be due and owing at the time of this Court’s Order.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also wants in on Wendy&#8217;s AFTRA Retirement Plan. His goal is for Williams to sign the Qualified Domestic Relations Order.</p>

<p>Additionally, Wendy Williams&#8217; ex-husband is asking the court to compel her team to fork over her financial records.</p>



<p>Specifically, he wants bank records &#8212; current ones, and those dating back to the dissolution of their marriage.</p>



<p>It seems that his goal is to investigate claims that Wendy Williams is broke. Apparently, he wants proof.</p>

<p>Obviously, Wendy Williams and her ex had a tense breakup. And money is a touchy subject in any divorce, whether a couple is rich or poor or in between.</p>



<p>But this case has even more complications. Williams herself has not had control of her own money for years. Not all of it, anyway.</p>



<p>We would like to have faith in the court system to sort this out. This whole situation is a very sad mess, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-son-my-mom-drank-so-much-she-got-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams is no longer who she once was</a>. </p>

<p><em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> introduced longtime fans to the firebrand&#8217;s family and employees.  This included Wendy Williams&#8217; publicist, Shawn Zanotti.</p>



<p>Viewers of the Lifetime docuseries expressed mixed emotions over Wendy&#8217;s actions, particularly how she initially spoke to her publicist. Then, concerned moved to the publicist and if she had Wendy&#8217;s best interest at heart. </p>



<p>While some argued that Wendy&#8217;s actions could not be helped it due to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-breaks-her-silence-addresses-overwhelming-dementia-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her dementia diagnosis</a>, others were reminded how vulnerable that made Wendy from people who would want to take advantage of her. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-is-unwell">Wendy Williams is unwell</h2>



<p>Her own team very recently revealed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams has primary progressive aphasia</a> and frontotemporal dementia.</p>



<p>Primary progressive aphasia means that there is damage to the parts of her brain that process speech and language. Frontotemporal dementia means a series of worsening symptoms, from language to motor control, and a reduced life expectancy.</p>



<p>This grim news came just days before the premiere of Lifetime&#8217;s <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> docuseries, which began its <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-documentary-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the TV personality&#8217;s troubled life</a> on Saturday, February 24.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, Wendy&#8217;s state of mind is vividly on display during the docuseries. It filmed between August 2022 and April of 2023.</p>



<p>Wendy speaks openly about her fondness for alcohol. The docuseries also delves into her health and history of drug abuse.</p>



<p>Wendy&#8217;s mobility is also an issue, as her lymphedema has radically altered her life. Early on, we see that she is preparing to move to a new apartment &#8212; one that is a single story, so that she can get around more easily.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-wendy-williams-docuseries-is-controversial">The Wendy Williams docuseries is controversial</h2>



<p>A lot of fans are expressing concern. There is a fine line between documentation and exploitation, and it doesn&#8217;t seem that Wendy fully understands the angle that the docuseries is taking.</p>



<p>Of course, many viewers get the feeling that producers had no idea what they&#8217;d be seeing, hearing, and recording before they began this project.</p>



<p>At times, Wendy seems unable to follow conversations &#8212; even though other moments show her lucid and humorous. Some of the interview subjects are more willing to discuss her cognitive decline than others.</p>

<p>One of the most polarizing aspects of <em>Where Is Wendy Williams?</em> has been how Wendy treats others during it.</p>



<p>At one moment, she verbally attacks a nail tech, demanding to know &#8220;Are you stupid?&#8221; She also rants about people who work closely with her.</p>



<p>One of the primary targets of Wendy Williams&#8217; wrath, from what the cameras show, appears to be her publicist: Shawn Zanotti.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wendy-williams-give-publicist-shawn-zanotti-a-hard-time">Wendy Williams give publicist Shawn Zanotti a hard time</h2>



<p>On camera, Wendy calls Shawn a &#8220;dumbass&#8221; over how she returns a jacket to the closet. She is repeatedly impatient with her.</p>



<p>During one horrifying moment, Wendy blurts out her &#8220;wish&#8221; that Shawn would undergo liposuction. That would be awful under any circumstances, but is particularly vile as a way to treat an employee.</p>



<p>Wendy became irate when Shawn couldn&#8217;t locate the right vape, and seemed to lash out when things weren&#8217;t exactly how she wanted them.</p>

<p>This is where viewers are finding themselves with wildly different takeaways.</p>



<p>Some are condemning Wendy&#8217;s behavior, even noting that dementia is not an &#8220;excuse&#8221; for this kind of verbal abuse. Others defend the talk show host, pointing out that she likely has no idea how rude she&#8217;s actually being. </p>



<p>Yet others have expressed suspicions as to why Shawn Zanotti is putting up with this. Who is this publicist that&#8217;s keeping this job instead of finding something less abusive? What&#8217;s her angle?</p>



<p>A few social media denizens have even gone so far as to accuse her of &#8220;stealing&#8221; from Wendy amidst the talk show legend&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diminished net worth</a>. Indeed, even Wendy&#8217;s own family is rather suspicious of the woman when they meet her. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-shawn-zanotti">Who is Shawn Zanotti?</h2>



<p>Shawn is the CEO of her own publicity company. She is the author of a PR guide book. And, at times, she ends up just doing things around the house because Wendy wants her to &#8211; or because she&#8217;s hoping to gain Wendy&#8217;s favor. </p>



<p>According to what she told the cameras, she has &#8220;thick skin&#8221; and can deal with Wendy&#8217;s insults. Ultimately, it looks like Shawn had ulterior motives. </p>



<p>But while Wendy has an excuse, viewers watch as this woman seemingly ignores all of the warning signs and red flags about Wendy&#8217;s condition.</p>



<p>Consider that, against everyone&#8217;s objection &#8211; Wendy&#8217;s family, her manager, even her guardian &#8211; Shawn takes Wendy to Los Angeles for a meeting about starting a new talk show. Plus, she lets her drink before meeting with network execs. </p>



<p>What was there to gain from this manipulation other than money? Wendy&#8217;s niece sees the writing on the wall almost instantly. At one point, she actually refuses to film scenes with Wendy because Shawn, show she &#8220;doesn&#8217;t know&#8221; inserts herself into their visit. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjJDhf5ll70
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Later, Will, Wendy&#8217;s manager, has it out with Shawn in a private meeting after the Los Angeles trip and after that point, Shawn is never seen again. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-shawn-still-work-for-wendy">Does Shawn still work for Wendy?</h2>



<p>Multiple sources have confirmed to <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/10516677/wendy-williams-manager-will-selby-publicist-shawn-zanotti-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The U.S. Sun</a></em> that Wendy&#8217;s publicist Shawn hasn&#8217;t worked for the ailing star for awhile. We can presume that this change happened after the disastrous LA trip, or at the very least when Wendy checked into a treatment center. </p>



<p>In an interview after the documentary aired, Shawn slammed the project, claiming it &#8220;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wendy-williams-documentary-exploits-star-publicist-dementia-rcna140839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits</a>&#8221; Wendy.</p>



<p>“That is not the project that [Williams] signed up for. That’s not the project [the producers] brought to me. That’s not what I told her this was going to be about,” Shawn said. </p>



<p>“There&nbsp;were a lot of good moments. None of those good moments were shown,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, her jeweler-turned-manager, Will, is said to be in contact with the star but not on a professional basis.</p>

<p>In ​an interview that aired Sunday night on the Lifetime documentary Where Is Wendy Williams?, Kevin Hunter Jr. opened up like never before.</p>



<p>The son of talk show host Wendy Williams, whose life has been under a microscope of late due to this program and the new information the public has learned <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/">about her ongoing health crisis</a>, Hunter Jr. dropped one major bombshell about his famous parent.</p>



<p>It sadly explains a lot about what fans have seen from her over the last few years, too.</p>

<p>“[Doctors] basically said that because she was drinking so much, it was starting to affect her headspace and her brain,” the 23-year explained during the February 25 episode of the two-part series. </p>



<p>“So, I think they said it was alcohol-induced dementia.”</p>



<p>Alcohol-related dementia, according to Healthline, is a “type of cognitive impairment that occurs as a result of heavy alcohol consumption over a long period.” </p>



<p>Over time, alcohol use can cause brain damage that affects a person’s ability to do daily tasks, such as cooking and managing their finances.</p>

<p>Last week, Williams’ team revealed a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-breaks-her-silence-addresses-overwhelming-dementia-diagnosis/">frontotemporal dementia and language disorder aphasia</a> in an attempt to “correct inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health.”</p>



<p>A representative for the former talk show host addressed the grave concern surrounding Wendy’s health in a February 22 statement ahead of the documentary’s release.</p>



<p>In part, it read:</p>



<p>“Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy&#8217;s ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy&#8217;s condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wendy’s rep added that while the choice to share information about her diagnosis was “difficult,” she hoped to “advocate for understanding and compassion for Wendy” and raise awareness about her conditions.</p>

<p>In general, the documentary paints a troubling picture of this star&#8217;s current mental state. </p>



<p>In one scene, while lying in bed, Williams tells her assistant that she’s “going back on TV in September.” Asked to explain what she means, Williams just says: </p>



<p>“According to my apartment.”</p>



<p>At other times, Williams accuses her assistant of stealing from her and doesn&#8217;t seem to know what the Academy Awards are.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Williams can be seen crying as she explains that, due to lymphedema, she now only has 2 percent feeling in her visibly swollen feet. </p>



<p>She berates a nail technician for applying a clear base coat of polish to her nails, asking her, “Are you stupid?”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all very sad. It&#8217;s all extremely disturbing.</p>



<p>In a statement of her own, Williams said last week:</p>



<p>“I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD).</p>



<p>“Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.</p>



<p>“The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion.</p>



<p>“I want to also thank the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for their kind words of support and their extraordinary efforts to raise awareness of FTD.</p>



<p>“I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive. Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.”</p>

<p>Wendy Williams has issued her first statement since the public was made aware of her troubling medical diagnosis.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we learned that the veteran talk show host <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-health/">has been diagnosed with dementia</a>, as well as aphasia.</p>



<p>Previously, while she was still front and center on her aforementioned talk show, Williams openly discussed how she had been battling Graves Disease for years.</p>



<p>This latest news comes in the wake of a reality show that revealed the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/wendy-williams-reality-show-is-exploiting-her-and-damaging-her-recovery-brother-warns/">sad depths to which Williams has sunk</a> due to her health concerns.</p>

<p>Said Williams on Friday, February 23:</p>



<p>“I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). </p>



<p>&#8220;Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.</p>

<p>The Wendy Williams Show host went on in the statement, advocating for those whose stories and experiences with this same diagnosis have gone unnoticed.</p>



<p>“I want to also thank the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for their kind words of support and their extraordinary efforts to raise awareness of FTD,” she concluded.</p>



<p>&#8220;I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive. Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fans have shown extreme concern over Williams over the past few months, weeks and days.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been speculation <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-stroke/">that she suffered a stroke</a>, but that has not yet been confirmed.</p>

<p>Williams&#8217; team announced her dementia diagnosis on Thursday, February 22. </p>



<p>In a press release, reps for this star said they received her diagnosis last year and the conditions “have already presented significant hurdles in Wendy&#8217;s life.”</p>



<p>“Wendy is still able to do many things for herself,” read a portion of this statement. </p>
