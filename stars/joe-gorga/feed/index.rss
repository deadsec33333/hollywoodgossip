<p>On the Reunion Part 3 for <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> Season 13, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/did-gia-giudice-really-tell-joe-gorga-he-can-do-better-than-melissa/">Teresa Giudice and Joe Gorga&#8217;s mess exploded</a>.</p>



<p>But the bond between the siblings didn&#8217;t go out with a bang, but with a whimper.</p>



<p>After the yelling, the crying, and the flying accusations &#8230; Joe extended an olive branch. A limited one, but still.</p>



<p>Teresa rejected it. And the two siblings, at an impasse, severed their relationship.</p>

<p>Melissa Gorga and Teresa Giudice do not like each other. That is &#8230; not new information. Only the accusations and the specifics of their feuding seems to change.</p>



<p>The two were yelling over each other so much during Part 3 that it was hard to hear what they actually had to say.</p>



<p>Honestly? We probably didn&#8217;t miss much.</p>

And there was Andy Cohen, caught between them.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just look at poor Andy Cohen during all of this.</p>



<p>Truly capturing what helpless misery looks like, he found himself sandwiched between the feuding factions.</p>



<p>Sure, that&#8217;s his job as a host. But usually, he&#8217;s moderating the discussions &#8212; not simply enduring a screaming match.</p>

<p>Make no mistake &#8212; the husbands remained very much involved.</p>



<p>This is <em>RHONJ</em>, after all. The husbands play a major role on the series, and join their wives on the Tell All.</p>



<p>Joe and Luis clashed. But a lot of the conflict ended up being between siblings.</p>

<p>Teresa told Melissa that this &#8212; the Season 13 Reunion &#8212; would be the last time that she speaks to Joe.</p>



<p>Joe is her actual brother.</p>



<p>That was enough to take Melissa aback. Smiling with anger, she backed off so that Joe and Teresa could say their final words.</p>

<p>Joe was quick to tell his sister that this is simply an awful thing for her to say.</p>



<p>Being angry is one thing. Severing ties is another.</p>



<p>There are <em>plenty </em>of good reasons to cut off a relative, even one as close as a sibling. But <em>this </em>mess? It has spiraled out of control. And it&#8217;s way out of proportion.</p>

<p>Teresa lashed out, accusing Joe of having &#8220;dragged&#8221; her &#8220;through the mud.&#8221;</p>



<p>For how long? &#8220;For 10 years,&#8221; she claimed.</p>



<p>It quickly became clear that Teresa is still fuming &#8212; and perhaps, has always been fuming &#8212; that the Gorgas joined <em>RHONJ </em>in the first place.</p>

<p>It really sounds like part of Teresa&#8217;s core point of contention is just that.</p>



<p>This was her thing, in her mind. Perhaps she viewed <em>RHONJ </em>as her fiefdom.</p>



<p>But she feels like Joe and Melissa ruined this, or at least took away from it, by joining.</p>

<p>That is &#8230; genuinely just an unacceptable way to speak. We don&#8217;t even mean the part about Melissa. That too, actually.</p>

<p>Luis blew his chances at feeling loved by his castmates (or viewers) a long time ago. Arguably just by being himself.</p>



<p>However, it looks like he&#8217;s hoping to instead be feared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your day is coming,&#8221; he taunted Joe. This is the sort of vague, childish threat that viewers have come to expect from Teresa&#8217;s <em>rubeus </em>husband.</p>

<p>Teresa did eventually become tearful.</p>



<p>According to her, she has been &#8220;good to&#8221; Joe all of this time.</p>



<p>Now, she feels like Joe has betrayed her. And that she cannot forgive it &#8212; or him.</p>

<p>Teresa did not want anyone following her.</p>



<p>At first, we thought that she meant producers. They, obviously, would follow her along with camera crews.</p>



<p>But Teresa was referring to Joe. He and Melissa are the ones whom she has no desire to see.</p>

<p>Backstage, she declared that she doesn&#8217;t want anything to do with Joe. She is washing her hands of him.</p>



<p>Andy and Gia both spoke to her.</p>



<p>For the record, Andy believes Gia when she says that she didn&#8217;t tell Joe that he could do better than Melissa. However, there is a possibility that there was an honest misunderstanding. And thus that no one is lying about this one issue.</p>

<p>The two parted ways. And, seemingly, have not patched things up since they filmed. If anything, the situation has grown worse.</p>

<p>The cast of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> will have a lot to discuss on the Season 13 Reunion.</p>



<p>And believe it or not, we&#8217;re not just talking about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-feud-puts-rhonj-season-14-on-hiatus/">Teresa and Melissa&#8217;s toxic feud</a>.</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/luis-ruelas-claims-he-hired-p-i-to-investigate-housewives-but-its-a-lie/">Luis&#8217; private investigator claims</a>. And there are so many hurt feelings, family developments, and more.</p>



<p>The promo for the Reunion shows the Housewives sitting down with Andy, and everything from him losing his cool to Luis and Teresa throwing out threats at castmates. It&#8217;s a mess.</p>

<p>In the Season 13 Reunion trailer, which you can watch for yourself below, things are tense from the start.</p>



<p>Even while everyone is just getting situated, Melissa Gorga reminds sister-in-law Teresa Giudice to &#8220;control herself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Is this the opening salvo of the Reunion&#8217;s hostilities, or is it a response to something that Teresa has already said or done? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>

They certainly had enough drama to fill the time.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As trailers tend to do, we get a lot of montages without a lot of context.</p>



<p>There is a lot of bad blood. That is no secret. The trailer also offers individual moments, as people give updates on family situations and relationships.</p>



<p>But then, we get to see some specific hostilities emerge.</p>

<p>Not pulling her punches, Teresa leans forward.</p>



<p>She calls her castmate &#8220;a devil.&#8221; And all indicators suggest that she is speaking to Margaret Josephs.</p>



<p>(Or, as Teresa has her listed in her phone, &#8220;Margret Joseph&#8221;)</p>

<p>One of the hints that she is speaking to Margaret is that we then see her lean forward and speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a criminal,&#8221; she seemingly tells Teresa.</p>



<p>And, she apparently adds, so is Luis Ruelas. We all know how Teresa feels when people criticize Luis.</p>

<p>Rachel Fuda&#8217;s reaction here is priceless.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to make a splash (without going overboard) on your first season.</p>



<p>But Rachel has definitely made some ripples this season. A lot of people hope to see her again.</p>

<p>Seriously, Teresa did not hold back when it came to leveling threats.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we see her taunt another castmate by saying &#8220;sleep with one eye open.&#8221;</p>



<p>Either editors are really playing fast and loose with context, or Tre just threatened a fellow Housewife.</p>

<p>Rachel and Danielle have a back-and-forth, though we cannot take our eyes off of the gorgeous purple of Danielle&#8217;s dress.</p>



<p>Then, when Jennifer hurls childish insults at Margaret, she dismisses them.</p>



<p>Why? She&#8217;s more concerned about what she&#8217;s been hearing about private investigators.</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs to defend himself,&#8221; Melissa explains of Luis&#8217; behavior, &#8220;by having a folder on all of us.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, a lot of troubling things from Luis&#8217; life came out when he first entered Teresa&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>So, he has loudly claimed, he is working to secure private info &#8212; blackmail material, potentially &#8212; against his critics. That is to say, all of Teresa&#8217;s castmates. (Bo Dietl, for the record, has quashed the claim of his involvement)</p>

<p>Even though Teresa has admitted that Luis was speaking in the heat of the moment, the two seem committed to aggression at the Reunion.</p>



<p>Luis calls out that he has information on at least one castmate during the trailer.</p>



<p>And the couple&#8217;s paranoia is such that Andy has to yell considerably to share a bit of odd news.</p>

<p>Andy learns from a producer that a security guard is trying to come upstairs and join the reunion special.</p>



<p>Apparently, he works for Teresa and Luis.</p>



<p>They claim that they have received death threats. That does sometimes happen on reality TV. What&#8217;s probably not reasonable is having the guard at the Reunion, in the room. Production is prepared for a fight, if one happens.</p>

<p>We also hear Teresa strongly claim that Melissa is leaving the show &#8212; against her will.</p>

<p>Teresa doesn&#8217;t officially have the power to do that. However, she may believe that she can strong-arm production into firing her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Jennifer Fessler was one of this season&#8217;s &#8220;Friends,&#8221; and shared a very memorable anecdote during a bus ride.</p>



<p>At the time, she opened up about having slept with James Gandolfini back in the &#8217;90s.</p>



<p>Apparently, she received some hurtful backlash over her age after this. That really sucks.</p>

Even though, during and after her incarceration, the two women were closer than ever.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, we see Teresa seemingly accuse Melissa of being behind her incarceration.</p>



<p>(Just for the record, it would be a stretch to say that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/caroline-manzo-i-didnt-rat-out-teresa-giudice-for-fraud-but-i-know-who-did/">whoever did report Teresa to the FBI for fraud</a> is &#8220;responsible&#8221; for her going to prison)</p>



<p>Andy isn&#8217;t buying Teresa&#8217;s accusation, but she now seems convinced. Unless the promo is misleading us.</p>

<p>Teresa seems to threaten her brother at one point.</p>



<p>The two have an unhappy back and forth. With one side (Teresa) getting way more words in edgewise.</p>



<p>&#8220;LET HIM TALK,&#8221; Andy yells. Perhaps this is the infamous moment when he storms off of the set.</p>

<p>We also see a more sorrowful presentation from Teresa.</p>



<p>She cries.</p>



<p>But she also seems to call her own brother &#8220;disgraceful,&#8221; so clearly, she&#8217;s dealing with more than just sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, I really can&#8217;t,&#8221; a hoarsely crying Teresa says.</p>



<p>She stands up and walks away, lifting the train of her gown as she slowly &#8220;storms&#8221; off of the stage.</p>



<p>&#8220;You should be ashamed of yourself,&#8221; she yells.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t come followin&#8217; me!&#8221; she yells at the cameras and at producers, whose jobs are of course to do just that.</p>



<p>What a mess! And it all starts on Tuesday, May 30.</p>

<p>Last week. Luis Ruelas admitted that he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/luis-ruelas-calls-joe-gorga-a-rat-doesnt-want-him-at-the-wedding/">doesn&#8217;t want Joe Gorga at the wedding</a>. He said it on camera.</p>



<p>This week, we learned the lengths that he and Teresa Giudice went to in order to <em>guarantee </em>that the Gorgas were no-shows.</p>



<p>Trying to be &#8220;helpful,&#8221; Danielle Cabral told Melissa about a nasty cheating rumor. About <em>her</em>.</p>



<p>Melissa had already heard it. And then the floodgates opened as she shared what Teresa and Luis had tried to do to her marriage.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to have a messy fight among friends and family, you might as well look spectacular for it.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the philosophy behind these Real Housewives parties. It&#8217;s also basically why <em>The Vampire Diaries</em> had like a million Decades Dances.</p>



<p>Danielle Cabral became convinced that she needed to sit down with Melissa Gorga and tell her what she&#8217;d heard.</p>

<p>Though initially expressing surprise that there was a rumor about her, Melissa shared that she has heard this before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already heard this story, and do you wanna know how? Through my husband,&#8221; Melissa told her. </p>



<p>&#8220;Do you wanna know how I heard it through my husband?&#8221; she asked. Rest assured, the question was rhetorical.</p>



<p>Melissa immediately answered: &#8220;&#8216;Cause his sister called him over to her house secretly without me to tell him this story behind my back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no intention of confronting [Teresa] about this,&#8221; Melissa shared with the camera.&#8221;Joe doesn&#8217;t believe it. It&#8217;s bulls&#8211;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;because I wanted to let her have a peaceful six months leading up to her wedding, look what ends up happening.&#8221;</p>



<p>Accurately describing the situation, Melissa pointed out: &#8220;She has her minion make me look bad in front of everyone so everyone can hear the words &#8216;Melissa&#8217;s a cheater.&#8217; And I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8">Danielle was quick to emphasize that she is only the messenger. Instead, Margaret Joseph&#8217;s ex-friend, Laura, is the alleged source.</p>



<p>But Melissa called Danielle a &#8220;s&#8211;t starter&#8221; and for, she believes, being a pawn in Teresa&#8217;s game.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-10">As for Teresa and Luis, she called them &#8220;such losers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret expressed her ire over Danielle using her &#8212; albeit indirectly &#8212; to make this move. She also confirmed that, obviously, this &#8220;rumor&#8221; never would have circulated without Teresa&#8217;s help.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-17">Teresa, meanwhile, admitted that she knew that Jennifer Aydin and Danielle knew, but claimed that it was out of her hands what they did with that information.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-19">Sure! It gets more and more believable every time that a Teresa minion acts on her own. (That&#8217;s sarcasm, folks)</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-44">Meanwhile, Luis Ruelas was red with &#8230; anger? He was mostly just extremely, <em>extremely </em>red, even for him.</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t resist yelling out that he had hired a private investigator to get dirt on all of the cast.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s &#8230; a hell of a thing to blurt out. Especially just days before your wedding, but there&#8217;s never a <em>good </em>time for it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, John Fuda held him back.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, even though she played a pivotal role in spreading this rumor and knew that Danielle and Jennifer knew about it, Teresa claimed to feel hurt that Melissa was angry with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Somehow, the finger always gets pointed at me,&#8221; she complained to the always-sympathetic Jennifer.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-53">&#8220;How can I go and celebrate somebody else&#8217;s marriage when they are the people constantly trying to destroy mine?&#8221; Melissa later asked. She&#8217;s talking about the wedding, folks.</p>

<p>After last week&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> incident where <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/teresa-giudice-tries-fails-to-stop-luis-ruelas-from-hot-mic-moment-about-melissa-and-joe/">Luis Ruelas had a hot mic moment</a>, he threw caution to the wind.</p>



<p>Now that the cameras caught how he really talks about Melissa and Joe Gorga, he had a choice to make: pretend like it was unusual, or double down.</p>



<p>On this week&#8217;s episode, Luis doubled down.</p>



<p>Luis called Joe &#8220;an animal,&#8221; insisting that he would not &#8220;lower himself&#8221; to the level of &#8220;f&#8211;king trash&#8221; like his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>During this episode, Teresa Giudice was in the midst of wedding planning.</p>



<p>Sitting outside just minutes before rain began, she chatted with Luis Ruelas about the finer points of seating arrangements.</p>



<p>Already, Joe and Melissa were coming up in conversation &#8212; and not in a fun way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During wedding planning, Luis Ruelas refers to &#8220;hoopla&#8221; that his future in-laws started. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>At first, Luis referred to Joe and Melissa as having started &#8220;hoopla&#8221; regarding the wedding.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s some pretty mild language. Maybe the most famous instance of the word&#8217;s use is on<em> Spongebob Squarepants</em>.</p>



<p>But that jab was only the first. And it understated the strong feelings of resentment at play.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Speaking to the confessional camera, Teresa Giudice says that the actual wedding planning is not stressing her out at all. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Teresa spoke to the confessional camera about how, unlike so many brides-to-be, she did not feel stressed about wedding planning.</p>



<p>(Often, wedding day stress relates to money and to it being a new experience. Teresa has married before, and she&#8217;s rich. That at least partially explains why the planning was so chill)</p>



<p>However, she noted that there were other things on her mind. Specifically, ongoing tensions with her brother and her sister-in-law.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas reach out to his mother, they marvel at how easy things are with his family. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the planning, they made a phone call to Luis&#8217; mother. She was very accommodating, insisting that she was fine with whatever plans they had.</p>



<p>Teresa marveled at the contrast between her interactions with Luis&#8217; family and what things have been like with hers.</p>



<p>As the rain began to fall, they made their way into the house. Quickly, the conversation shifted from nuptials to feuds.</p>

(Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Luis tried to take stock of things, he asked how things had been going.</p>



<p>He asked, specifically, about how things went with Melissa.</p>



<p><em>Not well</em> is almost a given. But Teresa had specific remarks about her sister-in-law&#8217;s reactions to things.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Using her nails to accentuate her gestures, Teresa Giudice expresses how her sister-in-law does not, to her, seem reasonable. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In her mind, Melissa is not reacting in proportion to events as she sees them.</p>



<p>(We have all watched both women become increasingly irate after every slight, every conflict)</p>



<p>Oh, and Teresa shared that Melissa was really dragging her heels about RSVPing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As Teresa Giudice shares that she has not received a response, Luis Ruelas suggests that his future sister-in-law wants them &#8220;to chase&#8221; after her. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Luis chimed in, saying that Melissa &#8220;wants us to chase&#8221; her for an answer.</p>



<p>In other words, he believes that it was some sort of power play on Melissa&#8217;s part.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Teresa pulled out her texts with Melissa. Specifically regarding the rehearsal dinner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Luis Ruelas looks at texts between his then-fiancee and Melissa Gorga. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within the texts, Melissa says that she didn&#8217;t know the person who texted her about the rehearsal dinner.</p>



<p>(Millions of Americans receive dozens of unwanted scam and spam texts and calls every week. The deluge makes it difficult to see important calls and texts from anyone who is not already a contact)</p>



<p>But Teresa and Luis weren&#8217;t buying Melissa&#8217;s story.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Looking at the texts, Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas note that surely everyone knows that a rehearsal dinner will happen the night before a wedding. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Teresa reasoned, this is a wedding.</p>



<p>Melissa is a grownup. A married grownup. She knows how weddings work.</p>



<p>There is pretty much always a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding.</p>

<p>Luis had read enough.</p>



<p>He very dramatically dropped Teresa&#8217;s phone onto the table. </p>



<p>(We know that it has a phone case, like they all have to have these days, but still, we winced)</p>

<p>She complained that her sister-in-law should &#8220;let him have his family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Luis said that he tired of Joe blaming him for every single thing.</p>

<p>Teresa&#8217;s ex-husband, Joe Giudice, had apparently reached out to Luis (after Gia brought him up to speed on the drama).</p>



<p>He advised Luis that, no matter what, Joe will find some way to blame him for everything.</p>



<p>This is like hearing about someone else&#8217;s game of telephone. We&#8217;re hearing Luis&#8217; account of what he talked about with Joe Giudice, whose info came from Gia, whose version of events came from Teresa and Luis. <em>Messy</em>.</p>

<p>Teresa emphasized how humiliated she feels that her family is causing problems.</p>



<p>On the one hand, we can all relate. We often feel like our relatives, our friends, are somehow our responsibility.</p>



<p>At the same time &#8230; some fans are already remarking that Teresa&#8217;s apparent need to apologize to Luis feels unhealthy. That could just be Luis&#8217; unsavory reputation at work, however.</p>

<p>This is when the gloves came off with Luis.</p>



<p>He hyped up his own self-restraint after remaining &#8220;calm in the last three months around an animal like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Teresa did not bat an eye at what he said. Or at what followed.</p>

<p>Luis declared that he was &#8220;not gonna lower myself to f&#8211;king trash&#8221; that behaves as Joe has.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Teresa&#8217;s response to this was to feel sorry for Luis for having put up with so much.</p>



<p>This is such an ugly, bitter situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>On this week&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, Joe Gorga claimed that Luis Ruelas had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/did-luis-ruelas-destroy-teresa-giudices-friendship-with-dina-manzo/">sabotaged Teresa Giudice&#8217;s friendship with Dina Manzo</a>.</p>



<p>According to him, it wasn&#8217;t unlike their pizza debacle. Money, business, and friendship can all tear each other apart in combination.</p>



<p>To hear Joe tell it, this was why Dina did not end up being part of Teresa&#8217;s wedding. Just another casualty to her romance with Luis.</p>



<p>Is that true?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The friendship between Teresa Giudice and Dina Manzo has spanned many years, though the latter values her privacy. (Photo Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>An inside source <a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/04/05/the-truth-behind-teresa-giudice-and-dina-manzos-friendship/">spoke to <em>Page Six</em></a> this week in the wake of Joe Gorga&#8217;s claims about Teresa and Dina&#8217;s alleged falling out.</p>



<p>“There is no issue at all, zero issue,” the insider stressed in the strongest possible terms on Wednesday, April 5.</p>



<p>The source went on to call Joe&#8217;s characterization of events nothing short of &#8220;comical.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Gorga is well aware of his sister&#8217;s perception &#8230; but he believes that he&#8217;s not the one causing relationship problems. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In case anyone missed the episode (and our recap), Joe had told cameras that David Cantin &#8212; Dina&#8217;s husband &#8212; had gone into business with Luis Ruelas.</p>



<p>According to Joe, the business deal blew up. Part of the fallout, he described, was friction between the men&#8217;s wives.</p>



<p>We have all watched with horror as the slightest criticism of or even question about Luis sends Teresa into a defensive rage as she circles the wagons around her &#8220;love bubble.&#8221; So it was not difficult to believe.</p>

(Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This new report doesn&#8217;t just say that there wasn&#8217;t a falling out over a business deal gone wrong.</p>



<p>Instead, it says that there wasn&#8217;t a deal gone wrong at all. Or a deal gone right. No deal whatsoever.</p>



<p>The insider claimed that David Cantin &#8220;never&#8221; went into business with Luis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Is Luis Ruelas just a guy trying his best, or is he a manipulator? Some wonder if it&#8217;s a little of both. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the source, Luis and David remain &#8220;close.&#8221; Not <em>despite </em>some sort of conflict, because it apparently never took place.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no beef,&#8221; the insider asserted.</p>



<p>The source then affirmed: &#8220;There are no issues.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After Joe Gorga shared his side of things, Melissa Gorga weighed in &#8230; theorizing that her sister-in-law is simply too selfish to share. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now &#8230; clearly, Joe either thought that there were &#8212; which would make him under several mistaken impressions &#8212; or conjured up a story like that for no reason. In the latter case, he would have known that someone would debunk it.</p>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<p>Naturally, everyone is asking Joe exactly that. And he has something to say.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-472679" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/0405_rhonj_joegorga_03.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clearly, Joe Gorga has identified the person whom he blames for tearing apart their family. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, we will all have to wait until Bravo gives the go-ahead to know what is on Joe&#8217;s mind.</p>



<p>“Joe can’t comment on this at the moment as the reunion is being filmed soon,&#8221; his rep told <em>Page Six</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure that Andy will delve into that. Given that these reports are out, and calling Joe a liar, it&#8217;s very likely to come up.</p>

That is a colossal understatement. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So where did all of this about Teresa and Dina come from? Well, when Dina did not attend her wedding to Luis. That certainly raised some questions.</p>



<p>Remember, Dina faced real trauma &#8212; inflicted by her ex &#8212; in New Jersey. She does not want to return to reality television, and values her privacy.</p>



<p>Bravo&#8217;s cameras were there to film her nuptials. Filming your wedding like that is always going to change the guest turnout &#8212; in more ways than one. But Dina can support Teresa without physically attending.</p>

<p>This season of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> has been so contentious that even attempts to make peace <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/teresa-giudice-explodes-at-jackie-goldschneider-ill-insult-melissa-all-i-like/">have had explosive results</a>.</p>



<p>One of the major talking points among the cast is whether Luis Ruelas is influencing Teresa Giudice &#8212; and how.</p>



<p>This week, we finally moved on from Luis coming between Teresa and her brother.</p>



<p>Instead, we heard all about how he had effed things up between Teresa and her longtime friend, Dina Manzo.</p>

<p>During The Season 13, Episode 9 episode of <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, we saw two stories in parallel.</p>



<p>Teresa Giudice hopped onto a call with Danielle Cabral, opening up to her about an incident involving Luis, her husband, allegedly breaking down into tears.</p>



<p>As it turns out, her brother, Joe Gorga, has also heard about this. And so has Melissa. They&#8217;re taking it a <em>little </em>less seriously.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Gorga is well aware of his sister&#8217;s perception &#8230; but he believes that he&#8217;s not the one causing relationship problems. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead, Joe wants to talk about how he believes that Luis has &#8220;f&#8211;ked up&#8221; more relationships for Teresa than just these family bonds.</p>



<p>He is talking about Dina Manzo, who has been a longtime friend of Teresa&#8217;s.</p>



<p>And it has ties to their pizza dispute. To the point where Joe even invoked the &#8220;pizza gate&#8221; name (though that is really &#8230; in poor taste, considering the dangerous conspiracy theorists behind the non-Gorga pizzagate).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga and Joe Gorga speak excitedly about the family squabble on The Real Housewives of New Jersey (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Dina’s husband, David [Cantin], called me because I’m friendly with David,” Joe explained in a confessional.</p>



<p>According to Joe, David and Luis had gotten into an argument over business.</p>



<p>They clashed, and the result was a tragic falling out between Teresa and Dina.</p>

<p>“And it f&#8211;ked up another relationship in Teresa’s life,” Joe characterized.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Despite her open hostilities, Teresa Giudice seems to regret this conflict with her remaining family. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“That’s why I look at Louie like, ‘Shut up,'&#8221; Joe complained passionately to his wife during the episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t want Louie being fake and faking with everybody,&#8221; he expressed.</p>



<p>Joe noted that Luis does this simply &#8220;because he just wants everybody to be nice with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because no, be real,” Joe demanded. His anger and distress were both apparent and palpable.</p>



<p>“He wants to help everybody, comes in like he’s God,&#8221; he characterized.</p>



<p>Joe then accused: &#8220;You’re [not] doing s&#8211;t.” </p>

<p>During the same episode, we learned that Jennifer Aydin and Dolores Catania were both part of Teresa&#8217;s upcoming bridal party.</p>



<p>They would be her bridesmaids during her wedding to Luis.</p>



<p>Of course, this factored into the episode&#8217;s discussions &#8230; and not only because the wedding is reasonably central to the existing conflicts.</p>

<p>See, according to Melissa&#8217;s theory, Teresa only asked Dolores to be a bridesmaid after Dina Manzo declined.</p>



<p>“Dolores was not even invited to the engagement party. Why? Because Dina was,” Melissa reasoned.</p>



<p>“I hear Louie and Dina’s man have an argument over business, these two are no longer friends. All of a sudden, it’s like, ‘Dolores, I was meditating ….’” Melissa continued. “So convenient, that meditation moment.&#8221; Ooh, <em>snark</em>.</p>

<p>We have heard so much about this ugly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/did-melissa-gorga-really-ban-teresa-and-fam-from-her-beach-house-of-course-not/">feud between Teresa Giudice and the Gorgas</a>.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, we heard from both sides.</p>



<p>Even as Luis tried to patch things up, Teresa fumed. Some of her insults towards Melissa were serious low blows.</p>



<p>When Jackie Goldschneider spoke up, Teresa snapped, screaming at her and doubling down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After previously not delving into this topic, Teresa Giudice opened up to a few RHONJ castmates about the pizza conflict. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to everyone involved, they put off discussing the pizza conflict for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Simply put, there was an idea to create a pizza business as a tribute to Teresa and Joe&#8217;s late father.</p>



<p>Money was a factor. Apparently, Luis put up six figures to join in on the venture. According to her, her then-fiance then lost a quarter of a million dollars. And she blames Joe.</p>

<p>Genuinely, we had to rewatch some scenes to figure out what the two sides were saying. Even then &#8230; we&#8217;re sure that there are a lot of details that never made it to air, and perhaps never came up on camera.</p>



<p>It sounds like Teresa is saying that Joe backed out and it cost Luis big time, which proved Teresa right. She didn&#8217;t want to mix business and family. For once.</p>



<p>But that is not the same version that Joe and Melissa shared. Obviously.</p>

<p>During the same episode, Joe expressed a similar reluctance to his sister&#8217;s to discuss it.</p>



<p>However, like Teresa, his reluctance did not actually prevent him from delving into the pizza crisis.</p>



<p>According to him, he was initially excited to go into this project with Luis.</p>

<p>Then, he and Melissa recalled, after ordering a group of pizza ovens, he heard about some pizza boxes. This was the first that he had heard of it.</p>



<p>Apparently, Teresa had done a photoshoot with her daughters for the pizza boxes. This was the first that Joe had heard of it.</p>



<p>There were clearly more to the conflict with that (including something about arguing about who receives what percentage of profits and ownership), but this is a reality TV episode, not a court case. Even if they listed every detail, not everything made it into the episode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After Joe Gorga shared his side of things, Melissa Gorga weighed in &#8230; theorizing that her sister-in-law is simply too selfish to share. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Melissa Gorga, the root of all of this is Teresa&#8217;s selfishness.</p>



<p>She suspected that Tre was too fundamentally self-centered to share a project like this &#8230; even with her brother, even in tribute to their dearly departed dad.</p>



<p>Anyway, later in the episode, it was Teresa&#8217;s turn to speculate about people&#8217;s mental states and motivations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Luis Ruelas tried to play peacemaker with Melissa Gorga. Teresa Giudice intervened. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Luis sat down with Melissa, who could tell that he was hoping to forge a path to piece for them all.</p>



<p>Of course, Melissa has seen another side to him. She commented on how this seems to be the side of who Luis wants to be and the side of who Luis <em>actually is</em>.</p>



<p>Either way, Teresa stormed over to intervene. And then she went and complained to her friends, and non-friends, about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Here, Teresa Giudice shares her thoughts while faithful minion Jennifer Aydin stands by her side. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“My brother needs to get therapy because he keeps blaming me for everything,&#8221; Teresa griped.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s not just me, she has daddy issues she needs to go get help,” she gossiped to Margaret Josephs and to Jackie Goldschneider.</p>



<p>Now, Jackie is a friend of both Melissa and Joe. She sighed and quietly observed that &#8220;that&#8217;s not nice.&#8221; True.</p>

(Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Jackie, shut the f&#8211;k up, get out of my f&#8211;king face!” Teresa screamed at her.</p>



<p>“Get out of my f&#8211;king face, get out of my face, shut the f&#8211;k up, get out of my face!” she continued. For the record, Jackie was not in her face, and she did not shut up.</p>



<p>Instead, Jackie asked Teresa if she understands that that was a &#8220;mean thing to say about somebody who lost their dad in a car accident&#8221; when she was only a teenager. Melissa had just turned 17.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice absolutely does not want to hear any callouts about how unkind she has been. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“There’s nothing wrong with that,” Teresa insisted. “She’s attached to my brother like, yeah, there’s issues.”</p>



<p>In the confessional, she added: “Melissa always talked about that she had daddy issues, how her father would go out all the time and he was cheating on the mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>She told the camera: &#8220;He was never home, so that’s why she always had a leash on my brother.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Calmly, Jackie Goldschneider pointed out the inherent cruelty of her castmate&#8217;s insult. It did not go over well. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in the actual scene, Teresa stormed off, declaring that Jackie was &#8220;pissing me the f&#8211;k off, you&#8217;re getting involved with family.&#8221; </p>



<p>Bonkers. </p>



<p>She then stormed off, citing her work in therapy for why she didn&#8217;t go after Jackie even more. All over a &#8220;that&#8217;s not nice.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actually, Teresa Giudice doesn&#8217;t see anything wrong with the things that she said. (Image Credit: Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Teresa told Melissa that she didn&#8217;t want her as part of the wedding because Melissa didn&#8217;t stand up to Margaret Josephs for revealing Luis&#8217; alarming history.</p>



<p>Of course, Melissa noted that Jennifer had called Joe a &#8220;crook&#8221; and &#8220;bitch boy&#8221; last season &#8230; without Teresa defending him. </p>



<p>But of course, in Teresa&#8217;s world, it doesn&#8217;t have to go both ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>There is more to the<em> The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> family feud than Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga&#8217;s animosity.</p>



<p>Their husbands are involved. Yes, Joe is Teresa&#8217;s brother, which makes all of this very complex.</p>



<p>Now, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/luis-ruelas-texts-joe-gorga-this-show-has-destroyed-your-family-not-me-though/">conflict between Luis Ruelas and Joe Gorga</a> is no secret. It has spilled out into the public sphere more than once.</p>



<p>This week, things became so ugly that the men exchanged violent threats, striking the table and yelling until they were red in the face. Well, <em>redder</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>On this week&#8217;s <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</em>, the countdown to Teresa and Luis&#8217; wedding continued to send ripples through the family.</p>



<p>Some of those ripples expanded into shockwaves.</p>



<p>One problem? Teresa and Luis weren&#8217;t inviting Melissa&#8217;s parents to their then-upcoming nuptials. Those are Joe Gorga&#8217;s in-laws just as much as Luis is. And arguably, more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>So, during a dinner among the husbands, Joe brought up this major snub.</p>



<p>(Dramatic? Yes. The <em>RHONJ </em>husbands get more screen time than the husbands from other cities all combined, and it&#8217;s for a good reason)</p>



<p>And to the surprise of absolutely no one, when Joe touched upon this topic, he did not mince words.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“F&#8211;k you, f&#8211;k you, you’re not a man, bro,” Joe told Luis.</p>



<p>He then accused his then-soon-to-be brother-in-law “You’re a f&#8211;king pussy, you know why.”</p>



<p>For some reason, over everything else, Luis focused on asking if Joe was implying that he is &#8220;not a man.&#8221; Toxic masculinity gives people weird priorities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Luis did not stop with that question, however.</p>



<p>He taunted Joe, simply declaring that “I’m so above you, it’s not even funny.”</p>



<p>Furious, Joe replied that he&#8217;d prove to Luis &#8220;what a f&#8211;king man is.&#8221; This may sound like one of those porn intros that goes viral because everyone is still dressed and their dialogue is super dumb, but this is just how these guys are.</p>

<p>Luis taunted Joe, inviting him to simply “talk all you want, because you’re not going to affect me.”</p>



<p>Apparently, if ordinary talk would not get the message across, Joe figured that threats would do. Oddly sexually charged threats.</p>



<p>“I’m gonna break your f&#8211;king balls!” Joe screamed in response, pounding the table with his hand. “F&#8211;king right now!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="519" height="405" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/teresa-giudice-and-her-fiance.jpg" alt="Teresa Giudice and Her Fiance" class="wp-image-414187" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/teresa-giudice-and-her-fiance.jpg 519w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/teresa-giudice-and-her-fiance-300x234.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/teresa-giudice-and-her-fiance-335x261.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/teresa-giudice-and-her-fiance-347x271.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice and her fiance, Luis Ruelas, are featured in this intense scene from a 2022 episode of The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By the way, Luis did offer an explanation for the total snub against Melissa&#8217;s parents.</p>



<p>He claimed that it was simply &#8220;a lot of past bulls&#8211;t&#8221; that convinced him and Teresa to leave Joe&#8217;s in-laws out in the cold.</p>



<p>Sure, a couple should be the ones who decide whom to invite to their wedding. But &#8230; if you leave someone off of the guest list, you know that it&#8217;s basically a declaration of war.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>This bitter conflict will not be the last, it seems. The Season 13 trailer made that extremely clear.</p>



<p>Previews teased that, for one reason or another, Luis will eventually threaten to &#8220;f&#8211;king punch&#8221; Joe Gorga &#8220;in the face.&#8221;</p>



<p>And, of course, the Gorgas do not end up attending Teresa and Luis&#8217; wedding. Yes, it&#8217;s really that bad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>The ongoing, raging <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/teresa-giudice-and-melissa-gorga-feud-divides-cast-they-wont-be-in-a-room-together/">feud between Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga</a> is not limited to them.</p>



<p>Yes, they have dragged their castmates into their spat. But their respective husbands play much <em>closer </em>roles in all of this.</p>



<p>Luis Ruelas and Joe Gorga recently had a heated, private conversation about the broken family dynamic.</p>



<p>That conversation is no longer private. The texts are now very public, and neither man was holding back.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Blogger <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CobCYTEswyD/"><em>All About The Tea</em> obtained</a> screenshots of alleged text messages between Luis Ruelas and Joe Gorga.</p>



<p>(Interestingly, the screenshots would seem to indicate that the &#8220;sender,&#8221; and thus the <em>source </em>of the leak of the texts, was Luis)</p>



<p>The context here is that Melissa Gorga recently suggested that the only reason that Luis invited her and Joe to Teresa&#8217;s birthday (her 50th birthday!) was because filming was imminent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“Hey Joe hope all is well,&#8221; a text, seemingly from Luis, begins. &#8220;I’ve been trying to get a hold of you to talk to you about Teresa’s 50th birthday.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continues: “She put together a list of people that she would like to be there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Luis then assures: &#8220;There is no expense to anyone Everything is paid for.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;This has nothing to do with show,&#8221; Luis seems to write.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s a private event for your sister,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;and the people she wanted to be with her on her day.”</p>



<p>Luis expresses: “I hope you receive this message with love from me to you and Melissa. I really hope you guys can make it.”</p>

<p>He writes: &#8220;Very confused as to why she would want to spend several days together for a special birthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen. I’m okay with everything,&#8221; Joe then seemingly writes.</p>



<p>He assures Luis: &#8220;Don’t feel the pressure to extend the invite I know it’s just coming from a fake place.”</p>



<p>The message then adds: “No need for it bro, I’m sure you watched the reunion. Enjoy your vacation.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“What’s fake is the thought of bringing this family closer thru a TV show,&#8221; Luis allegedly spat back in the leaked texts.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m extending this to you guys,&#8221; he claimed, &#8220;because this is what your sister wants.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Luis seemingly continued, it&#8217;s a &#8220;chance for you guys to grow off camera &amp; the public eye.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;The TV show is [a] combative place and full of superficial bulls&#8211;t not a forum for a family to recover,&#8221; Luis then wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn’t fake,&#8221; he claimed. &#8220;This isn’t strategic.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Luis, &#8220;this is coming from me who has been in your sisters life for almost two years now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I’m trying Joe &amp; Melissa,&#8221; Luis seemingly told him. &#8220;Nobody’s perfect including the both of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>At this point, Joe allegedly wrote back, noting that Luis might not understand because he has &#8220;only been here for two years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Joe noted that, in contrast, the family has had this &#8220;exact conversation for the last 15.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Luis, Teresa is now working on bettering herself. He thinks that people have a habit of &#8220;deflecting things that need to be addressed.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;Everyone plays a part in this demise and it’s not only Teresa.&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s true.</p>



<p>&#8220;All you have to do is watch the TV show,&#8221; Luis suggested, &#8220;and see how this has been.”</p>

<p>Joe Gorga would like to tell his side of the story.</p>



<p>Last month, Gorga and fellow Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member Aydin made headlines when an argument between the pair at the Gansevoort Hotel was caught on camera. </p>



<p>Shortly after the altercation, which included Aydin hurling her drink in the direction of Joe, Aydin’s social media assistant, Erica Madelyn, alleged in a TikTok video that Joe called her boss a “<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/melissa-gorga-jennifer-aydin-threw-her-drink-cause-joe-called-her-a-dirty-bitch/">f—king dirty bitch</a>.”</p>



<p><em>Yikes</em>, huh? Except&#8230;</p>

<p>“Everything that you heard is a lie,” Gorga claimed during an episode of the “Chicks in the Office” podcast on Friday, November 11, adding:</p>



<p>“The story is out there that she threw a drink at me, and I was saying these vulgar things to her. No.”</p>



<p>According to Joe, his wife, Melissa, “did say something” to Aydin, which caused the beverage to be thrown.</p>



<p>He blames everything on Aydin, however.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p> “If you watched her on the TV show through the years — she drinks a lot, she’s violent, she throws thing, she breaks glasses, she wants to stab you with it. She throws knives,” the businessman alleged. </p>



<p>“I mean, this is who she is, she’s crazy. </p>



<p>&#8220;Picture her in real life. That’s editing!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Joe Gorga looks pretty fired up in this photo from The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Joe confirmed on the aforementioned podcast that he got into a shouting match with Aydin&#8230; but clarified that the drink didn’t end up on him. </p>



<p>“She was out of control to the point where it was embarrassing,” he said on air. </p>



<p>“Yelling at the top of her lungs like a maniac.”</p>



<p>In late October, Melissa came forward her own account of the events, stating on her “On Display” podcast that Aydin gave her a “snarky stare in [her] eyes” as the Bravo personality made her way toward the elevators.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Aside from her assistant’s statements, Aydin has not addressed the altercation in depth.</p>



<p>However, a source previously told Us Weekly that Bravo was “not happy” after they learned about the scandal.</p>



<p>“Bravo PR did their best at keeping the split sides apart throughout the weekend but what happened outside of BravoCon was out of their control,” this insider revealed, noting there was an attempt to keep the cast “divided” throughout the weekend, but “they did cross paths.”</p>



<p>That same month, Andy Cohen weighed in on the drama, telling Entertainment Tonight: </p>



<p>“I think it’s gross. Period dot.”</p>
