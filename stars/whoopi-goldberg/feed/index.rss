<p> Is Whoopi Goldberg leaving <em>The View</em> after 14 years?</p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/whoopi-goldberg-weight-loss-med-mounjaro-300-pounds-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi&#8217;s controversies</a> to her most scathingly accurate <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/whoopi-goldberg-says-american-idol-sparked-the-downfall-of-society-appears-to-be-serious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statements about society</a>, the legendary actor&#8217;s time on <em>The View</em> has been indelible.</p>



<p>Some of Whoopi&#8217;s statements have spawned memes and become life mottos. But no one&#8217;s run on <em>The View</em> lasts forever.</p>



<p>Recently, the daytime talk series &#8211; and the country &#8211; have undergone some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-view-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major changes</a>. Shortly after the 2024 election, Whoopi admitted she wanted to leave the show and never come back. </p>



<p>And the plan may be already in motion. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whoopi-admits-she-s-having-hard-time-not-quitting-her-job">Whoopi Admits She&#8217;s Having &#8216;Hard Time&#8217; Not Quitting Her Job</h2>



<p>Like many, Whoopi has been in a stage of grief since Trump was elected to a second term in office. His reinstatement to power has many questioning what comes next. </p>



<p>Just one day shy of her 69th birthday, a time when many people her age are either retired or considering the life change, Whoopi admitted live on The View that if she had the means, she&#8217;d be quitting the show ASAP. </p>



<p>&#8220;I appreciate that people are having a hard time. Me, too. I work for a living,&#8221; Whoopi said during the panel&#8217;s Hot Topic discussion about the the election. Specifically, the team discussed  Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asking her social media followers to defend their support of Trump. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0">Whoopi then turned to the studio audience to stress, &#8220;If I had all the money in the world, I would not be here, okay? So, I&#8217;m a working person, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">&#8220;My kid has to feed her family. My great-granddaughter has to be fed by her family. I know it&#8217;s hard out there,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I love what [Ocasio-Cortez] did. Yay. We talk to people all the time who say, &#8216;This is what&#8217;s bothering me.&#8217; But, the thing that&#8217;s bothering everybody should not be the thing that puts 85 percent of other people in danger. I think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re saying.&#8221;</p>



<p>Point very well taken. So, for now, it sounds like Whoopi is staying with the show &#8211; at least until the end of the year, when a scheduled exit is already on the books. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whoopi-goldberg-leaving-the-view-in-december">Whoopi Goldberg Leaving &#8216;The View&#8217; In December</h2>



<p>Now, there&#8217;s more to the Grammy, Oscar, Golden Globe, and Emmy award-winning acting legend than <em>The View</em> &#8211; and she will be leaving the panel for some time towards the end of the year to pursue her other passions. </p>



<p>This holiday season, shes&#8217; playing the villainous Miss Hannigan in the <em>Madison Square Garden</em> stop in the Annie musical&#8217;s touring production. That will be from December 11 through January 5.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve seen Whoopi on a memorably chilling episode of <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em>, you know that she can play a villain pretty well. It&#8217;ll be a treat for audiences. </p>



<p>Perhaps the time away from the panel will give her the space she needs. Or maybe it will strengthen her resolve to leave the show forever. There were rumors at the top of the season that she was ready to quit before<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/whoopi-goldberg-refuses-to-say-trump-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> He Who Shall Not Be Named By Whoopi</a> was reelected. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rumors-she-s-quit-over-big-changes-at-the-show">The Rumors She&#8217;s Quit Over Big Changes At The Show</h2>



<p><em>The View</em> has moved. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; the long-running daytime talk show is still on ABC. But now, for Season 28, they have a new downtown New York studio.</p>



<p>Moves like this can happen for all sorts of reasons, from renovations to leasing shenanigans and more. In this case, host Sunny Hostin referred to the new Manhattan location as &#8220;state of the art.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, a new report by <em>The Sun</em> <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/12126790/whoopi-goldberg-furious-the-view-dressing-room-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> that <em>The View</em>&#8216;s new studio has some major drawbacks for its most famous host, Whoopi Goldberg.</p>



<p>The inside source described Whoopi&#8217;s dressing room: &#8220;It&#8217;s so small, and she doesn&#8217;t have her own bathroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dressing room drama may sound petty and even trite. But television hosts can spend a lot of time in dressing rooms. They can also be status symbols &#8212; showing favor or favoritism. And, let&#8217;s be honest: anyone whose job gets suddenly worse, including a smaller office, is entitled to feel unhappy about it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="918" height="795" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames.png" alt="Whoopi Goldberg victim-blames" class="wp-image-331839" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames.png 918w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-300x260.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-768x665.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-735x637.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-335x290.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-347x301.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-520x450.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/whoopi-goldberg-victim-blames-640x554.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">At times, Whoopi Goldberg has had the wrong take on The View. It happens.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-people-have-quit-jobs-over-less">People have quit jobs over less</h2>



<p>&#8220;Whoopi had the biggest dressing room with an ensuite including a shower and full bathroom,&#8221; the insider then explained, for context.</p>



<p>The new digs might be an overall upgrade for the show. But they&#8217;re a <em>downgrade </em>for Whoopi.</p>



<p>Whoopi also had the largest dressing room at the previous studio. This came with some social perks.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had a large table in her room, so she would hold the morning meetings and all the ladies would have to go to Whoopi&#8217;s in the morning,&#8221; the source dished.</p>



<p>Anyone whose home acts as a friend group&#8217;s social hub knows that there are advantages and disadvantages. But, most of the time, getting to stay in your comfort zone and have others visit you is worth having to straighten up after guests leave.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure that Whoopi would prefer to have everyone come meet with her than to have to go to them.</p>

<p>Instead, she&#8217;s allegedly moving her production office next door to these downtown studios. </p>



<p>That way, she can enjoy her comforts without having to settle for what ABC offers her.</p>

<p>Whoopi Goldberg has added her voice to the chorus of stars paying tribute to Maggie Smith.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/maggie-smith-cause-of-death-screen-icon-passes-away-at-89/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maggie recently passed away</a> at the age of 89.</p>



<p>She and Whoopi co-starred in the beloved 1992 comedy <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/lauryn-hill-jennifer-love-hewitt-skip-sister-act-2-cast-reunion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sister Act</a></em>, as well as its 1993 sequel, <em>Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.</em></p>

<p></p>



<p>In the decades that followed, the two screen legends remained close friends.</p>



<p>And Whoopi credited Maggie with lending much-needed support after the passing of her mother in 2010.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whoopi-goldberg-remembers-maggie-smith">Whoopi Goldberg Remembers Maggie Smith</h2>



<p>Shortly after news of Maggie&#8217;s passing went public, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAbGm7wJKZ0/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi posted a photo</a> of the two of them on set, along with a heartfelt caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maggie Smith was a great woman and a brilliant actress. I still can’t believe I was lucky enough to work with the &#8216;one-of-a-kind,'&#8221; Goldberg wrote, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;My heartfelt condolences go out to the family…RIP.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-enduring-friendship">An Enduring Friendship</h2>



<p>It was not the first time that Whoopi mentioned Maggie in recent months.</p>



<p>Recalling her mother&#8217;s death in a recent interview with <em><a href="https://people.com/whoopi-goldberg-remembers-sister-act-costar-maggie-smith-8719543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>, Goldberg praised Smith for helping her endure the grief.</p>





<p>“Having Maggie Smith be there, and being able to fall apart and having her say, ‘Listen, my friend. We&#8217;ll get you through this. We&#8217;ll get you through this,&#8221; Goldberg said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get you to the hospital so you can get her. Get you back to Berkeley so you can get home,’” she continued.</p>



<p>“We were up all night, just laughing and talking about stuff. And she had met my mom a couple of times. Just having somebody who got it, who understood, it&#8217;s everything.”</p>



<p>Whoopi also mentioned Maggie while discussing the possibility of a <em>Sister Act 3</em> during a recent <a href="https://ew.com/movies/whoopi-goldberg-maggie-smith-sister-act-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast interview</a>.</p>



<p>She addressed her friend over the air, telling Smith, &#8220;We just can&#8217;t do it with anybody but you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, if you need me to come over here and shoot it and do whatever we have to do, we will do whatever you want us to do,&#8221; Whoopi said. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t want to do it without you, Maggie.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-tragic-announcement">A Tragic Announcement</h2>



<p>Maggie&#8217;s passing was announced this morning her her sons, who revealed that she&#8217;d died &#8220;peacefully&#8221; in a hospital.</p>



<p>&#8220;An intensely private person, she was with friends and family at the end,&#8221; the statement read. </p>

<p>&#8220;She leaves two sons and five loving grandchildren who are devastated by the loss of their extraordinary mother and grandmother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We would like to take this opportunity to thank the wonderful staff at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital for their care and unstinting kindness during her final days,&#8221; Maggie&#8217;s sons continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;We thank you for all your kind messages and support and ask that you respect our privacy at this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to Maggie&#8217;s loved ones during this enormously difficult moment.</p>

<p>Has <em>The View </em>really been canceled?</p>



<p>Over the years, the legendary talk show has been a place for both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/jenna-lyons-reveals-her-hair-teeth-are-fake-due-to-genetic-condition-that-inspired-her-fashion-career/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heartfelt conversations</a> and some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/joy-behar-blackface-photo-emerges-view-host-comes-under-major-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nauseating scandals</a>. <em>The View</em> has produced viral moments and memes and more.</p>



<p>Now, a persistent rumor suggests that ABC is canceling the daytime series. Even more alarming, for weeks the show has been flip-flopping between live episodes and previously recorded shows.</p>



<p>So, is it really over? And if so &#8211; WHY?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-view-amp-it-s-legacy">&#8216;The View&#8217; &amp; It&#8217;s Legacy </h2>



<p><em>The View</em> premiered on ABC in 1997 after legendary journalist Barbara Walters created and, for years, hosted it.</p>



<p>The daytime talk show features multiple generations of women. Many of them are experts in their fields, others just famous faces, but all of them have something to say about &#8220;hot topics&#8221; from politics to culture and beyond.</p>



<p>This August marks the 27th anniversary of <em>The View</em>. It has been a mainstay of ABC&#8217;s daytime programming block for nearly three decades.</p>



<p>Which is why it feels weird that new episodes have been few and far between. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-people-still-love-watching-the-view">People Still Love Watching &#8216;The View&#8217; </h2>



<p>Ostensibly, viewers tune in to ABC&#8217;s long-running daytime talk series for a combination of celebrity commentary, relatable takes, and even legal expertise.</p>



<p>From journalists to famous actors to legal professionals to nepo babies to reality TV personalities, <em>The View </em>boasts an array of different points of view. It sort of goes with the name.</p>



<p>Some would argue that the panel being all-women is just a gimmick. Others would say that it&#8217;s refreshing to go a few minutes every day without hearing men&#8217;s opinions on current events &#8212; since male voices tend to overwhelmingly dominate so many aspects of life, entertainment, and culture.</p>

<p>Obviously, Barbara Walters was a living legend, but a rotation of notable woman have followed her at the table.</p>



<p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell was quite the character, and very memorable during her time on the show. Sherri Shepherd once sat on the panel, but now has her own show, having taken the timeslot of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor Wendy Williams</a>.</p>



<p>Even people who are mostly famous for their time on <em>The View </em>have produced, as we noted, memes and viral moments. The clip of Ana Navarro above is a prime example.</p>



<p>Often, short clips of the talk show &#8220;break containment&#8221; (that is, go well beyond their target audience of somewhat older women) and become widely popular. Especially when the hosts fight or do what we can only describe as <em>misbehave</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Elizabeth Hasselbeck was part of <em>The View </em>from 2003 through 2013. She didn&#8217;t win her Emmy Award for competing on <em>Survivor</em>, after all. She quickly became infamous for her, well, bad takes on a number of events.</p>



<p>Hasselbeck set a specific tone for the show. The network has since tried to replicate her role, casting other &#8220;villains&#8221; (for lack of a better term) like Candace Cameron Bure and Meghan McCain to instigate drama. </p>



<p>Notably, we&#8217;re not referring to conservative hosts, here. Nicolle Wallace &#8212; who worked for the George W. Bush White House&#8211; and Jedediah Bila, Ana Navarro, and Abby Huntsman are all noted conservatives. They never stepped into the &#8220;villain&#8221; roles like <em>some </em>others, however.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-running-low-on-villains-may-get-the-view-canceled">Running low on villains may get &#8216;The View&#8217; canceled</h2>



<p>For years, Meghan McCain held the role as <em>The View</em>&#8216;s primary antagonist. She would literally huff angrily while other hosts spoke, which was an unbecoming and childlike response to disagreements.</p>



<p>Obviously, a lot of people on social media were eager to see ABC show her the door. In July of 2021, McCain announced her upcoming departure, citing her family&#8217;s move.</p>



<p>But even as some viewers cheered, we couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if it&#8217;s good for the show to see such a dramatic person &#8212; one who&#8217;s right just enough of the time to keep you guessing, but is so often loudly wrong &#8212; leave. After all, <em>The View </em>survives on ratings, not on maintaining a moral and behavioral standard.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-the-view-really-been-canceled">Has &#8216;The View&#8217; Really Been Canceled?</h2>



<p>In the summer of 2023, rumors that <em>The View</em> is ending began to take root. Those rumors have continued into 2024 and have continued for MONTHS</p>



<p>However, as of July 2024, there are no indications &#8212; not from behind the scenes or any public announcements &#8212; that the rumors are true.</p>



<p>At present, ABC has not canceled <em>The View</em> and likely doesn&#8217;t plan to any time soon.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re worried about why there aren&#8217;t any new episodes the answer is quite simple: summer hiatus. </p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean big changes aren&#8217;t coming for the show. </p>



<p>“After 10 years and 2,143 episodes, this is the last show we’ll do from this studio,” Sunny Hostin revealed during an episode of the daytime talk show on August 2.</p>



<p>However, before the crowd could get too concerned that the show was being axed, Sunny explained that the show would be carrying on, but from a new location. </p>



<p>“We’re sad to say goodbye, but we are thrilled to be moving to a brand-new studio downtown — brand-new, state-of-the-art — and we will see you there in September for the premiere of season 28!” she said.</p>



<p>Phew! Close call!</p>

<p>Whoopi Goldberg turned to a controversial drug after she weighed nearly 300 pounds. Now, she&#8217;s opening up about that experience.</p>



<p>After a recent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/bachelor-fans-oprah-winfrey-ozempic-town-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oprah Winfrey town hall</a> that critics blasted as an &#8220;infomercial for Ozempic,&#8221; the cohosts of <em>The View</em> weighed in on controversial luxury weight-loss medications.</p>



<p>Viewers listened to them discuss stigma around weight and very recent weight loss meds. There are some good points and some missed points and some <em>very </em>bad points.</p>



<p>Whoopi Goldberg shared her experience taking one such medication &#8212; <em>not </em>Ozempic &#8212; after finding herself weighing more than she wished to.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whoopi-goldberg-took-mounjaro-after-weighing-nearly-300-pounds">Whoopi Goldberg took Mounjaro after weighing nearly 300 pounds</h2>



<p>On <em>The View</em> on Tuesday, March 19, the acclaimed actress shared her own experience with weight gain and loss.</p>



<p>“I will tell you, I weighed almost 300 pounds when I made <em>Till</em>, and I had taken all those steroids, I was on all this stuff,&#8221; Whoopi recalled. &#8220;And one of the things that’s helped me drop the weight is the Mounjaro &#8212; that’s what I use.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mounjaro and Zepbound are two brand names for Tirzepatide. The medication works differently from semaglutide (like Ozempic), but is also a diabetes medication that has <em>very </em>recently become a luxury weight loss drug for the wealthy.</p>

<p>“I just always felt like me, and then I saw me, and I thought, ‘Oh, that’s a lot of me,&#8217;” Whoopi recalled of noticing her weight gain.</p>



<p>She noted that her size has gone up and down over the years, but that she had ignored external input on her body shape. Smart! It sounds like this weight loss was for her, rather than to meet anyone else&#8217;s expectations.</p>



<p>&#8220;There’s nothing wrong [with taking weight loss drugs],&#8221; Whoopi asserted. &#8220;Stuff happens, you hit a certain age and everything falls to the ground, you know you just pick it up put it over the back and keep it moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoopi&#8217;s comments came in the context of Oprah&#8217;s ABC special, in which she discussed the decades of stigma and overt cruelty over her weight gains and losses.</p>



<p>Oprah has openly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/oprah-winfrey-ozempic-weightwatchers-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to using luxury weight loss drugs</a>, though she has not specified which one.</p>



<p>She is branding the availability of diabetes medications for non-diabetics to use for weight loss as a &#8220;revolution.&#8221; It&#8217;s clear that a tremendous amount of pain has fueled her feelings on the matter.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are people who errantly shame people for medical weight loss because they believe that they should be able to do it &#8220;naturally.&#8221; </p>



<p>That&#8217;s obviously <em>malarkey</em>, both because no one &#8220;has&#8221; to lose weight at all, and because genetic and biological realities have more control over long-term weight than any diet or exercise scheme.</p>



<p>However, critics are right when they note that we do not yet know the long-term effects of non-diabetic patients taking these injections. Critics are even more right when they point out that documented shortages have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/danielle-cabral-condemns-ozempic-misuse-for-weight-loss-run-on-a-f-king-treadmill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left diabetic patients unable to access their medication</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sunny-hostin-took-the-same-medication-as-whoopi-goldberg">Sunny Hostin took the same medication as Whoopi Goldberg</h2>



<p>During the same Tuesday episode of <em>The View</em>, Sunny Hostin shared that she had also taken Mounjaro following a 40 pound weight gain.</p>



<p>She shared that she had received angry emails, shaming her and accusing her of taking a medication from diabetes patients. (It&#8217;s unclear why she mentioned this without explaining why she believes that she wasn&#8217;t doing so, or why she thinks that this is okay)</p>



<p>Sunny told Whoopi and the others that she still felt less shame after receiving hate mail than she did before her weight loss. That is a more damning indictment of our fatphobic society than anything else.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, one of the best takes on the matter came from Joy Behar &#8212; who often puts her foot in her mouth. This time, however, she pointed out that body size preferences are social preferences.</p>



<p>She even posited that perhaps, if luxury weight loss meds make thinness universally obtainable, perhaps society will become more accepting of more body shapes. After all, then thinness will no longer be a staple of the wealthy (and winners of the genetic lottery).</p>



<p>The discussion did, overall, have a lot of <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2012/12/is_there_really_an_obesity_epi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-scientific brainrot about the &#8220;obesity epidemic.&#8221;</a> Conflating health with body size is a dangerous mindset, especially in a world where <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/jennifer-fessler-is-still-on-ozempic-after-hospitalization-im-not-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people using Ozempic end up in the hospital</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not every day that Whoopi Goldberg defends Kate Middleton.</p>



<p>The royal family celebrated UK Mother&#8217;s Day with a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-family-portrait-removed-by-news-agencies-due-to-alleged-editing-wth-is-going-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fake family portrait starring Kate Middleton</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>frankenphoto</em>, an amalgamation of other pics of the Princess of Wales and her kids, has earned widespread mockery. Especially after a claim that Kate personally doctors the photos.</p>



<p>However, Kate has someone unexpected in her corner. In a clip that you can watch below, Whoopi Goldberg says that what happened is no big deal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-middleton-has-a-scandal">Kate Middleton has a scandal</h2>



<p>On Sunday, March 10, Princess Kate Middleton shared a dubious family photograph on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4U_IqTNaqU/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. It showed obvious signs of digital tampering.</p>



<p>Of all of the royal faces, only Prince George&#8217;s face did not receive some sort of obvious editing. Digital experts and hobbyists alike pointed it out, multiple publishers refused to run the pic, and Instagram itself flagged the doctored portrait.</p>



<p>Kate explained <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-editing-photo-wedding-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the phony photo</a> on Twitter, claiming that like other &#8220;amateur photographers&#8221; she, personally, experiments &#8220;with editing.&#8221; The image of the Princess of Wales hunched over a computer to edit her children&#8217;s looks earned a lot of scoffs on social media.</p>

<p>On a March 11 episode of <em>The View</em>, cohost and acting legend Whoopi Goldberg spoke her mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I know very few people who don&#8217;t manipulate their own photographs,&#8221; she remarked to the audience and fellow panelists.</p>



<p>&#8220;All you&#8217;ve got to do is swipe, none of those people look like they&#8217;re supposed to look,&#8221; Whoopi argued when it comes to people on social media in general. &#8220;She&#8217;s doing the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-everyone-defends-kate-middleton-the-way-that-whoopi-goldberg-does">Not everyone defends Kate Middleton the way that Whoopi Goldberg does</h2>



<p>Sunny Hostin questioned the idea of the &#8220;future queen&#8221; personally &#8220;taking selfies with her family,&#8221; let alone editing them herself.</p>



<p>Whoopi disagreed, taking Kate&#8217;s word for it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to tell you, she may be the future queen, she&#8217;s still an amateur photographer,&#8221; the acting legend countered. &#8220;That&#8217;s what they do.&#8221;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Whoopi then took on a slightly facetious tone, telling her cohosts: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure none of you have ever tampered with your own.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then continued: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t change the fact that she said, &#8216;Listen, I manipulated the pictures, I&#8217;m sorry.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Whoopi went on to quip that everyone would be &#8220;in jail for the rest of our lives&#8221; if it became illegal to edit one&#8217;s own photos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-whoopi-right-to-defend-kate">Was Whoopi right to defend Kate?</h2>



<p>This is a complex matter. Because, in a vacuum, someone who&#8217;s essentially a country&#8217;s very expensive mascot editing a family portrait is <em>nothing</em>. It would be, at worst, cringe.</p>



<p>But given the widespread <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/surprise-kate-middleton-shares-new-photo-with-kids-amid-wild-conspiracy-claims-about-her-condition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy theories about Kate Middleton&#8217;s extended seclusion</a>, it was ill-timed. It was awkward.</p>



<p>And, as people have pointed out, there&#8217;s a double standard  under which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/meghan-markle-prince-harry-reaction-kate-middleton-photo-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle would never have gotten away</a> with a photoshop fail.</p>

<p>Whoopi Goldberg is not afraid to speak her mind.</p>



<p>Not even when it might get her in trouble with her employer.</p>



<p>And not even when it might not make a lot of sense to most rational people.</p>



<p>Allow us to explain&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="383" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-476386" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg.webp 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-480x270.webp 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-320x180.webp 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-335x188.webp 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-347x195.webp 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-520x292.webp 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/17.-Whoopi-Goldberg-640x360.webp 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking earlier this week on The View, the actress and long-time host came hard for American Idol, a reality TV competition that formerly aired on Fox and now airs on ABC, the same network home as the aforementioned talk show.</p>



<p>“We as a society love to watch stuff to judge folks.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve always thought that the beginning of the downfall of society was with — what’s the name of that show?” Goldberg asked on air, summoning the help of an off-screen producer.</p>



<p>“ABC’s American Idol?” the producer replied, emphasizing the network to Goldberg as a not-to-subtle hint.</p>



<p>Which she did <em>not</em> take.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="889" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-1024x889.jpg" alt="Whoopi Goldberg Returns!" class="wp-image-413835" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-1024x889.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-300x260.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-768x666.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-735x638.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-335x291.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-347x301.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-520x451.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-640x555.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-960x833.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns.jpg 1059w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was not always on ABC,” Goldberg said. “When it began, it was on another network.”</p>



<p>She then arrived at her point.</p>



<p>“Once we gave people the ability to judge other people, I think we ran amok with it, and it’s gone out of control,&#8221; Whoopi explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;They invited the public to decide who that person was. Once we did that, it began us in a cycle.”</p>

She got suspended from The View as a result.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in the day, viewers did take great pleasure in seeing Simon Cowell tear a contestant apart.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re pretty sure judgment existed in society long before American Idol premiered.</p>



<p>“When I was watching it, ABC didn’t have it,” Goldberg went on to say in an attempt to defend her network. </p>



<p>“They have it now, it’s a different show. It’s a very different show. The judges are different. It changed.</p>



<p>&#8220;ABC knows that I feel like this. I’ve told them. It has nothing to do with them.”</p>

<p>Goldberg has often made headlines for taking unusual stances on The View.</p>



<p>In February 2022, she got suspended after saying the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-stuns-the-view-audience-claims-holocaust-was-not/">Holocaust had nothing to do with race</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I said something that I feel a responsibility for not leaving unexamined because my words upset so many people, which was never my intention,&#8221; she said upon her return to the program.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got was really helpful and it helped me understand some different things.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Holocaust &#8220;<em>is</em>&nbsp;indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race,&#8221; Goldberg continued prior to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-race-based-holocaust/">her suspension by ABC</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, words matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unlike elected officials or appointed ambassadors, the royals are meant to be above the political fray, a position that allows them to meet with foreign leaders and address issues of global historical importance without having to worry about the next election cycle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a relatively light load for a bunch of people who are born to lives of unimaginable wealth and privilege.</p>
<p>So when the royals are derelict in their duties, the public outrage is understandably rather intense.</p>

<p>Often, it&#8217;s the British people who demand that the royals right some historical wrong, but this week it was two hosts of <em>The View</em> who called on the residents of Buckingham Palace to address their predecessors&#8217; misdeeds.</p>
<p><a href="/2022/03/kate-middleton-prince-william-enjoy-second-honeymoon-amid-pregna/">Prince William and Kate Middleton are currently on a tour of the Caribbean</a>, and Whoopi Goldberg is among the many who believe that there&#8217;s no better time for the royals to address the UK&#8217;s history of&nbsp;race-related atrocities.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot ignore the fact that Britain ran roughshod over India for years,&quot; Goldberg said on Monday.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Let us not forget, when we talk about what needs to happen, all the folks that need to apologize.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldberg went on to note that the royals have made a modicum of progress with regard to their sensitivity on these matters.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, this is not new,&quot; the host continued.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I suspect Charles, when he was in Barbados [in 2021] had some idea because he went on and apologized as he was releasing the hold that Britain has,&quot; Whoopi said.</p>
<p>&quot;So perhaps somebody is listening, and it&#8217;s the new group of folks &ndash; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s Charles, William, but one of them is supposed to be the person.&quot;</p>
<p>Co-host Sunny Hostin echoed these sentiments, pointing out that the Brits&#8217; history of colonialism and enslavement is as old as the British Empire itself.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;The Brits rarely, especially the royals, rarely talk about their history of enslavement. They rarely talk about how they got their wealth off the backs of Black people,&quot; Hostin said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a recent appearance in Jamaica, Prince William apologized on behalf of his family for the centuries of injustice that have taken place in that part of the world.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to express my profound sorrow. Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened,&quot; William said during a dinner in Kingston.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;While the pain runs deep, Jamaica continues to forge its future with determination, courage and fortitude,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;The strength and shared sense of purpose of the Jamaican people, represented in your flag and motto, celebrate an invincible spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, the royals will never be able to make amends for the many injustices that have unfolded under the aegis of the British flag.</p>
<p>But in apologizing and accepting responsibility, the younger generation of royals is promising to try and ensure a more equitable future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Whoopi Goldberg returned to The View on Monday morrning.</p>
<p>The veteran actress and lead talk show host had been suspended from her role over the past two weeks after saying on air that the historic tragedy of the Holocaust&nbsp;<a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-stuns-the-view-audience-claims-holocaust-was-not/">had nothing to do with race</a>.</p>
<p>Upon re-taking her seat today (alongside&nbsp;Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro), Goldberg did not specifically address this controversy.</p>
<p>But she did talk in detail <em>around</em> it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="889" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-1024x889.jpg" alt="Whoopi Goldberg Returns!" class="wp-image-413835" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-1024x889.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-300x260.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-768x666.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-735x638.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-335x291.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-347x301.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-520x451.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-640x555.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns-960x833.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-returns.jpg 1059w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>&quot;I missed you all,&quot; said Goldberg early in the hour.</p>
<p>&quot;I got to tell you, there&#8217;s something kind of marvelous about being on a show like this because we are The View and this is what we do.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes we don&#8217;t do this as eloquently as we could.&quot;</p>
<p>This would be an understatement when it comes to the star&#8217;s misguided message back on February 1.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On that episode, she and her colleagues were talking a Tennessee school board&#8217;s decision to ban the Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus, a book that chronicles the story of illustrator and author Art Spiegelman&#8217;s Polish Jewish parents&#8217; experience during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The school board cited concerns about female nudity and profanity and removed the material from the eighth-grade curriculum.</p>
<p>This was when Goldberg made the remark (adding that the Holocaust was &quot;about man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man&quot;) for which she later apologized.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I said something that I feel a responsibility for not leaving unexamined because my words upset so many people, which was never my intention,&quot; she began in this mea culpa.</p>
<p>&quot;And I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got was really helpful and it helped me understand some different things.&quot;</p>
<p>The Holocaust &quot;<em>is</em> indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race,&quot; Goldberg continued prior to <a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-race-based-holocaust/">her suspension by ABC</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, words matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know, and as you all know because I&rsquo;ve always done that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As mentioned previouslyy,&nbsp;Goldberrg she did not directly discuss the scandal this morning.</p>
<p>However, the Oscar winner told the camera that &quot;we&#8217;re going to keep having tough conversations,&quot; adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I listened to everything everybody had to say and I was very grateful and I hope it keeps all the important conversations happening because we&#8217;re going to keep having tough conversations.</p>
<p>&quot;And in part, because this is what we were hired to do.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-1024x683.jpg" alt="Whoopi Goldberg on The View" class="wp-image-413425" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>Concluded Goldberg on air today:</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not always pretty as I said and it&#8217;s not always what other people would like to hear, but it is an honor to sit at the table and be able to have these conversations because they&#8217;re important.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#8217;re Important to us as a nation and important to us more as a human entity.&quot;</p>

<p>Goldberg was suspended for two weeks over her &quot;wrong and hurtful comments,&quot; ABC News President Kim Godwin said in a previous statement, which read as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments.</p>
<p>&quot;While Whoopi has apologized, I&#8217;ve asked her to take time and reflect and learn about the impact of her comments.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family, and communities.&quot;</p>

<p>But she&#8217;s also very angry.</p>
<p>The Oscar-winning actress, as you likely know at this point, has had quite the week.</p>
<p>On Monday, Goldberg made the following comment, in regard to a school board in Tennessee banning a book about a Holocaust survivor.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s be truthful about it because [the] <a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-stuns-the-view-audience-claims-holocaust-was-not/">Holocaust isn&rsquo;t about race</a>. It&rsquo;s not about race. It&rsquo;s about man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.</em></p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long forr Goldberg to get excorciated for this take, as she garnered&nbsp;damning criticism from multiple Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the U.S. Holocaust Museum.</p>
<p>Goldberg took to the air a day later and apologized for the wildly misguided remark.</p>
<p>&quot;I said something that I feel a responsibility for not leaving unexamined because my words upset so many people, which was never my intention,&quot; she said on Tuesday&#8217;s episode of The View.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The long-time lead host continued in her mea culpa:</p>
<p>&quot;I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got was really helpful and it helped me understand some different things.&quot;</p>
<p>The Holocaust &quot;is indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race,&quot; Goldberg then said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Now, words matter and mine are no exception.</p>
<p>&quot;I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected. I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know, and as you all know because I&rsquo;ve always done that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Despite these words, <a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-race-based-holocaust/">ABC suspended Goldberg</a> for two weeks a few hours after she uttered them.</p>
<p>&quot;Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,&quot; ABC News President Kim Godwin said in a statement on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;While Whoopi has apologized, I&#8217;ve asked her to take time and reflect and learn about the impact of her comments.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family, and communities.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We haven&#8217;t heard from Goldberg since this announcement was made.</p>
<p>However, an insider now tells Page Six that the well-known television personality isn&#8217;t taking the suspension well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She feels ABC executives mishandled this. She followed their playbook,&quot; a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/02/02/whoopi-goldberg-threatening-to-quit-the-view-source/">source tells this outlet</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;She went on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and then apologized again on The View the next day.&quot;</p>

<p>Goldberg feels &quot;humiliated,&quot; this same report alleges, adding that she may walk away from the daytime talk show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ego has been hurt and she&rsquo;s telling people she&rsquo;s going to quit,&rdquo; the source concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspension from The View is like getting suspended from Bravo. The bar is very low.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For whatever it&#8217;s worth, Goldberg&#8217;s colleagues don&#8217;t want her to leave, and seemingly don&#8217;t think she deserved to be punished for her Holocaust remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love Whoopi Goldberg. I love &lsquo;The View,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ana Navarro told the Daily Beast on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was an incredibly unfortunate incident. Whoopi is a lifelong ally to the Jewish community.</p>
<p>&quot;She is not an anti-Semite, period. I am sad. And I have nothing else to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very, very far from it.</p>
<p>On Monday&#8217;s episode of The View,&nbsp;Goldberg made a very strange and wildly misguided statement&nbsp;during a conversation about the Tennessee school board&rsquo;s ban of &ldquo;Maus,&rdquo; a nonfiction graphic novel about cartoonist Art Spiegelman&rsquo;s father&#8217;s experience as a Holocaust survivor.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be truthful about it because [the] Holocaust isn&rsquo;t about race,&rdquo; Goldberg said in response at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about race.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s about man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unusual take drew immediate, sweeping criticism from Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the U.S. Holocaust Museum&#8230; and it led to an apology by Goldberg on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;I said something that I feel a responsibility for not leaving unexamined because my words upset so many people, which was never my intention,&quot; the actress said on air yesterday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;And I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got was really helpful and it helped me understand some different things.&quot;</p>
<p>The Holocaust &quot;is indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race,&quot; Goldberg continued, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Now, words matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know, and as you all know because I&rsquo;ve always done that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sincere words? Maybe.</p>
<p>But <a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-race-based-holocaust/">ABC suspended Goldberg on Tuesday night</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,&quot; ABC News President Kim Godwin said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;While Whoopi has apologized, I&#8217;ve asked her to take time and reflect and learn about the impact of her comments.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family, and communities.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This brings us back to Meghan McCain.</p>
<p>The former View co-host penned a damning op/ed for The Daily Mail on Tuesday, trashing Goldberg&#8217;s mea culpa a &quot;half-assed apology&quot; and taking her to task for previous remarks about Roman Polaski and Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>&quot;I was lectured to thousands of times on The View, there is a belief that &#8216;cancel culture&#8217; is really &#8216;accountability culture&#8217; among the woke left,&quot; wrote McCain.</p>
<p>&quot;Which seems to be a belief that&#8217;s quickly forgotten whenever it&#8217;s Whoopi who has to be held to account.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>To be clear, McCain wrote all of this before Goldberg&#8217;s suspension was announced.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not calling for Whoopi Goldberg to be fired, if only because I don&#8217;t believe there is any universe where she could possibly do anything that could get her fired &#8212; she is the crown jewel of The View and a pop culture icon,&quot; continued to daughter of former Presidential nominee John McCain.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hope this can be used as a teachable moment to explain to millions of Americans why conflating the Holocaust as something that is specific and limited to &#8216;white people&#8217; is insane, ahistorical and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>&quot;For as much as the left is fond of using Nazi comparisons and imagery, the truth of the Holocaust, who it targeted and why, deserves to be known and understood by all.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain believes &quot;liberal hosts are held to an entirely different standard than anyone else,&quot; adding in her piece:</p>
<p>&quot;Whoopi has said a slew of insanely-controversial and hurtful things over the course of her tenure at The View.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the more notorious ones include defending Roman Polanski for raping a 13-year-old (calling it &#8216;not rape, rape&#8217;) and defending Bill Cosby after over 50 accusers had come out publicly with their stories.</p>
<p>&quot;With age and status comes protection at The View.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>McCain went on to asserted that some folks &quot;will never face the same ramifications and repercussions that others will,&quot; referring to this as a &quot;double, triple, and even quadruple standard if you are conservative.&quot;</p>
<p>She cited Roseanne Barr and Sharon Osbourne as examples of so-called canceled Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;There are those who will be given protection and coverage for their bad behavior from networks and executives no matter what,&quot; McCain wrote.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="856" height="880" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic.png" alt="Meghan McCain View Pic" class="wp-image-332521" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic.png 856w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-292x300.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-768x790.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-735x756.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-326x335.png 326w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-338x347.png 338w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-506x520.png 506w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-623x640.png 623w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-747x768.png 747w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Toward the end of her op-ed, McCain mentioned that The View founder Barbara Walters is &quot;one of the most famous Jewish American women in American history&quot; and that she doesn&#8217;t believe &quot;a show of one myopic opinion was her intention.&quot;</p>
<p>No response yet to this scathing criticism from McCain.</p>
<p>Not frrom Goldberg and not from ABC.</p>
