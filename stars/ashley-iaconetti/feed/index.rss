<p>Kelly Ripa is getting slammed this week for remarks she made during a recent interview with Jenn Tran.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-bachelorette-recap-who-did-jenn-tran-send-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenn made her debut as the new Bachelorette</a>.</p>



<p>As is customary for stars of the franchise, she promoted the new season by making an appearance on <em>Live! with Kelly and Mark</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-1024x576.jpg" alt="Jenn Tran on ABC" class="wp-image-496529" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-480x270.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-720x405.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-320x180.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-735x413.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-335x188.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-347x195.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-520x293.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-640x360.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-960x540.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/jenn-tran-bachelorette-2024.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenn Tran reacts here to being named The Bachelorette on ABC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kelly-ripa-questions-jenn-tran-s-motives">Kelly Ripa Questions Jenn Tran&#8217;s Motives</h2>



<p>In the past, Kelly has not been shy when it comes to expressing her misgivings about<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-bachelorette-2024-season-21-jenn-tran-contestants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the <em>Bachelor</em> franchise</a> and the stars&#8217; chances of finding a lasting relationship.</p>



<p>“You’re drop-dead gorgeous,” Kelly said to Jenn this week, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/11/entertainment/ex-bachelor-contestant-calls-out-kelly-ripa-for-offensive-jenn-tran-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“You could meet anybody anywhere, at any time. Why, why, why [<em>The Bachelorette</em>]?&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="741" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2150217176-1024x741.jpg" alt="Kelly Ripa attends the 2024 Time100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 25, 2024 in New York City.

<p>She went on to ask why Jenn didn&#8217;t try to meet someone at “medical school” or “the office.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her husband and co-host Mark Consuelos chimed in and noted that Jenn could’ve met someone at “church.”</p>



<p>“I have a question. Where did you meet your husband? On TV, no?” Tran shot back.</p>



<p>Kelly and Mark indeed met when they were costars on All My Children in the ’90s. But as Kelly pointed out, that&#8217;s quite different from meeting on a reality dating show.</p>

<p>“Those are not the same. We were both professional,” Ripa said. </p>



<p>“Are you acting on your show? I didn’t marry [Mark’s character] Mateo Santos. I married Mark Consuelos.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kelly-ripa-gets-slammed-by-former-bachelor-stars">Kelly Ripa Gets Slammed By Former &#8216;Bachelor&#8217; Stars</h2>



<p>Many viewers were critical of Kelly&#8217;s harsh line of questioning, including former <em>Bachelor</em> contestant <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-meet-our-newborn-son/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley Iaconetti</a>.</p>



<p>&#8216;</p>



<p>“It disappoints me when I see that Kelly Ripa has such an ax to grind with the<em> Bachelor</em> franchise,” Ashley said to co-host Ben Higgins on their &#8220;Almost Famous&#8221; podcast this week.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1024x577.webp" alt="Jenn Tran for ABC" class="wp-image-501148" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1024x577.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-768x433.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-960x541.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy-1200x676.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/171439_DSC_9423_-copy.webp 1296w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenn Tran is the first-ever Bachelorette of Asian American descent.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (DISNEY/JOHN FLEENOR)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Every time we have a lead go on the show to promote it, she always seems to be so skeptical of &#8212; a little bit of the lead, and their decision to be the lead &#8212; and also just the process,” she continued.</p>



<p>Ashley went on to allege Ripa “just seems to really shame the show,&#8221; which seems like a fair observation.</p>



<p>“She loves to pick at <em>The Bachelor</em> and <em>The Bachelorette</em>,” Ashley said, adding that there are “so many reality shows out there that are so much more trashy.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Ben agreed that Kelly “definitely doesn’t like the show&#8221; and noted that she gave him a hard time in a similar way when he appeared on <em>Live!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;It makes for an awkward interview,&#8221; Ben noted, before joking:</p>



<p>“I don’t know if they denied her the <em>Bachelorette</em> role at some point.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kelly and Jenn&#8217;s interview ended on a cordial note. </p>



<p>But Ashley and Ben&#8217;s comments probably won&#8217;t convince Kelly that she should become a card-carrying member of Bachelor Nation!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Bachelor Nation is once again abuzz with baby fever.</p>
<p>Thanks to&nbsp;Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon.</p>
<p>The reality stars shared the first photos of their newborn son, Dawson Demitri, on Instagram Tuesday &#8230; after announcing the news of his birth on Monday afternoon.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Dawson entered the world on a very important day in our family. January 31st is not only my mom&#8217;s birthday, but also the day my parents met 44 years ago,&quot; Iaconetti wrote alonside a sweet snapshot of the couple with its son.</p>
<p>&quot;We pretty much had the best labor and delivery experience you could ever ask for thanks to INOVA Fairfax hospital and the NOVA Group For Women.</p>
<p>&quot;I feared it forever and it wasn&#8217;t that bad! I will go in-depth on the story eventually.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Bachelor in Paradise cast members, who met on season 2 of the series and got married four years later, confirmed the day prior that their first kid had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby Dawson is here and healthy!&rdquo; Haibon told his Instagram followers at the time. &ldquo;Ashley is recovering and doing well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former Bachelorette suitor added that his firstborn son&rsquo;s delivery &ldquo;really couldn&rsquo;t have gone much smoother,&rdquo; referring his little one as a &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; child who had been &ldquo;sleeping all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how long that lasts for, huh?!?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>For her part, Ashley echoed this same sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now we&#8217;re enjoying the sleepiest, calmest baby we&#8217;ve ever met. Dawson did not get his chill from his parents,&quot; she continued in her own post.</p>
<p>&quot;He did get his feet from me, his chin from Jared, one of his names from a Leo character, and another one of his names from, well, see Jared&#8217;s IG caption.</p>
<p>&quot;We love him so much and are feeling so blessed!!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Just hours ahead of Dawson&rsquo;s arrival, the husband and wife shared a funny video via Instagram where they polled their followers on which former New England Patriots quarterback was hotter:</p>
<p>Tom Brady or Jimmy Garoppolo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 1,000 percent [Tom],&rdquo; Iaconetti said while sitting beside her husband. &ldquo;I mean it has to do with the whole package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haibon agreed saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tom,&rdquo; confirming that his answer when the pair first met in Mexico was the same and he still stands by that response today.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Ashley and Jared previously revealed they were having a boy, and also admitted their son is named after the main male characterr from the movie Titanic.</p>
<p>Wrote Haibon in July as a way to announce his major family news:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show you a picture of Ashley right after we found out she was pregnant and tell you how much I appreciate this woman.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though it&rsquo;s been a rough first trimester so far, she is as beautiful today as she was in this picture.</p>
<p>&quot;Ashley has been a trouper and I love her so much. Last night, she threw up five times throughout the night. It&rsquo;s been a very sick month for her. I feel terrible because there&rsquo;s not much I can do except the occasional runs to the store for chocolate cake or to 7/11 for Slurpees.</p>
<p>&quot;I love her very much, she&rsquo;s a strong woman and I know Ashley is going to be an incredible mother.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Attention, Bachelor Nation:</p>
<p>You&#8217;re about to get a brand new resident!</p>
<p>On Thursday, July 15, Ashley Iaconetti and husband Jared Haibon&nbsp;announced the precious and miraculous news that they are expecting their first child together during an Amazon Live event.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m pregnant!&quot; Ashley told fans before sharing a special kiss with Jared.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The former ABC personalities got engaged in June 2018 and opened up about their future family plans ahead of their 2019 nuptials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to have kids in 2020 or 2021,&rdquo; the Bachelorette alum told Us Weekly just over two years, adding that they planned for &ldquo;two or three&rdquo; kids.</p>
<p>How did they arrive at this number?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about the gender, Iaconetti explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I want a boy to have another brother or a girl to have a sister. But I also need to have a girl. &hellip; I think that when you do the math, it equals out to three.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The husband and wife&#8217;s baby bombshell comes less than two months after Ashley said that she and Haibon were hoping to start a family &#8212; and had been trying to conceive for the past six months.</p>
<p>&quot;A couple months ago, I was saying I would start feeling worried if I wasn&#8217;t pregnant by June,&quot; Ashley wrote on Instagram in May.</p>
<p>&quot;This month was annoying, because I ovulated five days earlier than expected and we pretty much missed my fertile window.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#8217;t had an irregular month in YEARS.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Iaconetti added that she wasn&#8217;t sure if the stress from moving to Rhode Island in March was a factor in her &quot;irregular&quot; cycle, but she remained positive, writing at the time:</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s a slim chance I&#8217;ll find myself pregnant come June.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a challenging journey for the pair, however.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trying for three or four months now,&rdquo; Haibon said during a Clickbait With Bachelor Nation podcast episode in February.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll be the fourth month that we&rsquo;ve actually tried. She has her watch, it tells her when she&rsquo;s ovulating.</p>
<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s very good at [letting me know] this day, that day, this day, this day. [I&rsquo;m like], &lsquo;Alright that&rsquo;s good, just tell me when.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Rhode Island native noted that while he &ldquo;would love to have both a boy and a girl,&rdquo; he was partial to a daughter because of their female dog.</p>
<p>For real!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s really dainty and delicate like Daddy&rsquo;s little girl, and I kind of want that in a human,&rdquo; Haibon said.</p>
<p>Ashley previously teased that she and the 32-year-old soulmate had already discussed baby names together. They&#8217;ve been waiting for this moment for a long, long time.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re not telling a future boy&#8217;s name because we&#8217;re set on it, and I have been set on it for over 10 years,&quot; Ashley captioned an Instagram post.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t want anyone to steal it/I don&#8217;t want it to become popular! (As if I have the power to do that).</p>
<p>&quot;I like Arena for a girl because the fan girl in me gets high off the energy in an arena. Jared&#8217;s not sold on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p>

<p>Actually, you better make it two boxes. Just to be safe.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday morning, just several hours after <a href="/2019/08/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-are-married-hooray/">exchanging vows with Ashley Iaconetti</a> &#8212; in front of friends, family members and loved ones in Rhode Island &#8212;&nbsp;Jared Haibon jumped on Instagram and gushed over his brand new wife.</p>
<p>And we mean he <em>GUSHED</em> over her.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s so many emotions running through my body right now,&quot; Jared wrote on Instagram alongside a photo from his wedding day.</p>
<p>He continued in equally sentimental fashion:</p>
<p>&quot;I woke up yesterday morning, the day of my wedding, crying. Not from sadness, or fear. I was crying because I was so overwhelmed with happiness, excitement, gratefulness and humbleness.</p>
<p>&quot;Ashley is my best friend, my person, my soulmate and now my wife. I love this woman more than words will ever allow me to express.&quot;</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Ashley and Jared starred together on Bachelor in Paradise Season 2 and got engaged on Bachelor in Paradise Season 5.</p>
<p>In between, they dated on and off until Jared admits he got a &quot;kick in the ass&quot; by seeing Ashley in a serious relationship with someone else.</p>
<p>At that point, in early 2018, the pair got serious and then got engaged a few months later.</p>
<p>Added Haibon in this new Instagram message:</p>
<p><em>In the coming days/weeks/months, I&#8217;ll be sharing so many pictures and videos from our wedding because it was the best day of my life. </em></p>
<p><em>At this moment, I truly feel like the luckiest man in the world.</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to various insiders and outlets, the romantic&nbsp; wedding featured personal vows from both the bride and groom.</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise producer Elan Gale officiated and familiar names in attendance included&nbsp;Nick Viall, Dean Unglert and couple Jason Tartick and Kaitlyn Bristowe.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, American Idol&#8217;s David Cook actually perform &quot;Ever the Same&quot; for the couple&#8217;s first dance, just like he did at our wedding.</p>
<p>Just kidding. This one sounds far more special than that of anyone on The Hollywood Gossip staff.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;It was just a big party! The DJ played a lot of Disney songs, musical soundtracks and Backstreet Boys&mdash;the music was very Ashley,&quot; an E! source says, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of dancing and it went pretty late but a bunch of people continued partying afterward&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Ashley was a glowing gorgeous bride. She was so happy all night. You could tell they both were so happy.&quot;</p>
<p>What else do we know about the big day?</p>
<p>The bride and groom exchanged Neil Lane wedding bands &#8212; and Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts even teamed with Banga Portrait Studio to provide custom edible photo donuts as an extra-special treat.</p>
<p>How fun!</p>

<p>So the semi-famous couple hopes, at least.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Bachelor in Paradise alums exchanged vows on Sunday evening in Rhode Island, People Magazine and other outlets have now confirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp;Iaconetti speaking to this publication about the occasion and saying the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We freakishly agreed on everything. Growing up we had the exact same vision of our wedding, [doing] it as grandiose as it has become.&quot;</p>
<p>Added Haibon, whose dog Clark served as the precious and beyond adorable ring bearer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so accustomed to being together, and living together, that marriage is the obvious next step!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among other beloved/well-known members of Bachelor Nation, People writes that&nbsp;Nick Viall, Dean Unglert and couple Jason Tartick and Kaitlyn Bristowe were in attendance at the event.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly been quite the journey for these two reality stars.</p>
<p>Viewers met Iaconetti on Chris Soules&#8217; season of The Bachelor &#8230; and then were introduced to Haibon on Kaitlyn Bristowe&#8217;s season of The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>Both suitors advanced pretty far in their quest at those times to find a soulmate, but neither earned the final rose.</p>
<p>However, they refused to give up on love and/or fame, appearing on the second season of Bachelor in Paradise.</p>
<p>They <em>did</em> go on a date during this run of episode, only for Haibon to dump Iaconetti. who made it very clear during their initial time together that she was totally smitten with Jared.</p>
<p>Still, the pair remained friends and even had a few romantic flings in the months that followed.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Finally, in May of 2018,&nbsp;<a href="/videos/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-dating/">Haibon admitted that seeing Ashley</a> with another man served as a &quot;kick in the [rear end]&quot; for him; it made him realize that he truly did want to be with&nbsp;Iaconetti.</p>
<p>&quot;I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,&quot; Jared said in a video the two filmed about a year and a half ago, adding back then:</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.&quot;</p>
<p>About a month after this footage was shot, Jared proposed to Ashley &#8212; <a href="/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-get-engaged-you-wont-believe-w/">on a Season 5 episode of Bachelor in Paradise</a>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just this undeniable, magnetic force between the two of us that just is indescribable,&rdquo; Haibon told People at the 2018 Nylon Young Hollywood Party, continuing at the time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love conquered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later,&nbsp;Iaconetti said the following to Bachelor alum Higgins during iHeartRadio&#8217;s The Ben and Ashley I Almost Famous Podcast:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;He is my person. He is my soul mate.&quot;</p>
<p>How very sweet, right?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As for specific details from the wedding, courtesy of People?</p>
<p><strong>Iaconetti wore an Ines Di Santo ballgown she purchased from Lovella in Glendale and jewels from Brooke Rayn Jewelry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Haibon chose a tuxedo from Black Tux.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They exchanged Neil Lane wedding bands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iaconetti and Haibon served New England-inspired hors d&rsquo;oeuvres and treated guests to a pasta bar during cocktail hour, prior to everyone tucking into traditional wedding fare by Blackstone Catering.</strong></p>
<p><strong>American Idol alum David Cook serenaded the newlyweds for their first dance with &ldquo;Ever the Same.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts also teamed with Banga Portrait Studio to provide custom edible photo donuts as an extra-special treat.</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Saaid Iaconetti:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jared and I from the very beginning have been saying we don&rsquo;t want our wedding to be a party. We want it to be a romantic experience!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More like&#8230; No Longer a Paradise Because I Just Asked the Woman of My Dreams to Marry Me! In Paradise!</p>
<p>Indeed, while this reality show title would be way too long and would make very little sense in nearly every context, it would apply perfectly at the moment to Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to People Magazine (and the revealing photo below), Haibon popped the biggest question of his life to Iaconetti on Sunday.</p>
<p>And he did it in a way that was simultaneously romantic, public and very much planned ahead of time:</p>
<p>He proposed while filming Bachelor in Paradise Season 5.</p>
<p>In an image released by ABC,&nbsp;Haibon Haibon got down on one knee on the beach, opened up his ring case and allegedly stunned his bride-to-be, who reacted by placing her hands on her chest and throwing her head back in excitement.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, loyal fans of this reality series may recall, Iaconetti was devastated to be turned down by Haibon after seemingly getting close to him on Season 2 of this same series.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="832" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-832x1024.png" alt="Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Pic" class="wp-image-300873" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-832x1024.png 832w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-244x300.png 244w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-768x946.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-735x905.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-272x335.png 272w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-282x347.png 282w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-422x520.png 422w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-520x640.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-624x768.png 624w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-780x960.png 780w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic-877x1080.png 877w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-pic.png 1076w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC/Paul Hebert)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But the stars remained close and Haibon eventually came to the same realization Ashley had before him:</p>
<p>They were soulmates!</p>
<p>&quot;I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise, which is why I said we&#8217;re still going to be friends,&quot; Jared said during a YouTube video of the couple&#8217;s love story, which they titled &quot;The Story of Us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like, it just didn&#8217;t feel over,&quot; he added in this lengthy and often-mocked piece of footage.</p>
<p>Haibon also admitted in this video that Ashley dating some other dude is what&nbsp;gave him the &quot;kick in the ass&quot; he needed to see what was in front of him this entire time.</p>
<p>Watch the video here:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-dating"></a></figure>
<p>&quot;Bachelor Nation hasn&rsquo;t seen so many of the important details that make up our story,&quot; the couple says in this video, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;[We] thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of The Story of Us.&quot;</p>
<p>Back during their first run on Bachelor in Paradise, there was chatter that <a href="/2015/08/ashley-iaconetti-pregnant-deflowered-on-bachelor-in-paradise/">Haibon and&nbsp;Iaconetti had sex</a>, which would have been the first time for the latter enjoying such an experience.</p>
<p>It might explain what has drawn Ashley to Jared with such intensity over the years if this rumor is accurate.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just this undeniable, magnetic force between the two of us that just is indescribable,&rdquo; Haibon told People Magazine at the annual Nylon Young Hollywood Party last mont, adding at the time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love conquered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there was this from Iaconetti, said to Bachelor alum Ben Higgins during iHeartRadio&#8217;s The Ben and Ashley I Almost Famous Podcast:</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;He is my person. He is my soul mate.&quot;</p>
<p>What else ise there to say?</p>
<p>Congrats to the very, very happy couple!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two months ago, it was revealed that&nbsp;<a href="/2018/03/ashley-iaconetti-and-kevin-wendt-its-over/">Ashley Iaconetti and Kevin Wendt broke up</a>. Ashley&#8217;s famous quest for love continued.</p>
<p>But it has come to a happy end. Remember how hard she was crushing on Jared Haibon on <em>Bachelor in Paradise</em>? Some dreams do come true.</p>
<p>In the video below, they tell the story of how it took years for them to finally, finally get together.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Fans and viewers know very well that Ashley has been crushing on Jared since 2015 at least.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;ve had flirtations on and off camera, and this has been building for a long time.</p>
<p>Jared reveals that it was the news that Ashley had gotten with someone &#8212; Kevin &#8212; that made him realize that he had been an idiot for not committing to her in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes I need a kick in the ass,&quot; he says. &quot;That was a big kick in the ass.&quot;</p>
<p>And here they are.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speaking to <em>People</em>, <a href="http://people.com/tv/bachelor-ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-dating/">Ashley and Jared</a> tell the story of their love. It&#8217;s a long and sweet story &#8230; with a few bumps.</p>
<p>Ashley says:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Bachelor</em>&nbsp;Nation hasn&rsquo;t seen so many of the important details that make up our story.&quot;</p>
<p>So they figured out a way to clue in fans to the full scope of their romantic history.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of&nbsp;<em>The Story of Us.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>You can see that video, below.</p>
<p>Jared says:</p>
<p>&quot;Our close friends have watched our relationship evolve and understand how we&rsquo;ve gotten to this point.&quot;</p>
<p>He knows that the Bachelor Nation, on the other hand, hasn&#8217;t seen the whole picture until now.</p>
<p>&quot;But people who haven&rsquo;t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us &lsquo;Wait, how did this happen?&rsquo; With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an idiot.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ashey had been crushing on Jared since they first met, and Jared &#8212; like the rest of the planet &#8212; knew it. Staring is not subtle.</p>
<p>But when they actually spent time with each other, things went well.</p>
<p>Jared talks about their first date.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along &hellip; how the conversation just flowed.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very good contrast to awkward staring.</p>
<p>&quot;It never felt dull &#8230; or awkward.&quot;</p>
<p>Ashley, however, remembers things a little differently.</p>
<p>&quot;My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye.&quot;</p>
<p>She was nervous.</p>
<p>&quot;I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Jared reveals that he felt that their relationship continued, even when they weren&#8217;t together.</p>
<p>&quot;I never felt like it was over between us after <em>Paradise.&nbsp;</em>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during <em>BiP</em>. It was a slow build for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the two got together, made out, and cuddled off-camera, they eventually had to move on because something wasn&#8217;t right.</p>
<p>Jared says that he was not, at the time, willing to commit.</p>
<p>&quot;I think sometimes you imagine like you&rsquo;re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I&rsquo;m like going after this other girl and we&rsquo;re going on dates, and yet it&rsquo;s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date &hellip; there&rsquo;s no going back.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, people click so well that it scares them. They&#8217;re worried about screwing up a good thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if I had a two percent doubt about our relationship, then I probably shouldn&rsquo;t do it because I don&rsquo;t want to risk losing you as a friend.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In addition to their own Instagram pages, these two lovebirds made a cameo on Dean Unglert&#8217;s page.</p>
<p>Dean captioned the cute pic:</p>
<p>&quot;Couldn&rsquo;t be happier for these two! [purple heart emoji] So don&rsquo;t mind me while I sit on the floor beneath the canoodling.&quot;</p>
<p>That is so sweet.</p>
<p>Check out this video and remember that, sometimes, even love at first sight takes a while to manifest into a fulfilling relationship.</p>
