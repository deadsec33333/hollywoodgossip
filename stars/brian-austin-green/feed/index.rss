<p>Brian Austin Green has taken his feud with Machine Gun Kelly public.</p>



<p>And we could <em>not</em> be more here for it.</p>



<p>As you might recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/megan-fox-pregnant-2/">Megan Fox announced in November</a> that she&#8217;s pregnant with her fourth child &#8212; the first three with ex-husband Green and this latest one with Kelly.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks after we learned about this blessed piece of news, however, we also learned that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/megan-fox-and-machine-gun-kelly-its-over-again/">Kelly had broken up with Fox</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522290" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Austin Green at BuzzFeed&#8217;s &#8220;AM to DM&#8221; on August 13, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t know why exactly.</p>



<p>But Green spoke to TMZ shortly after this break-up took place and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/brian-austin-green-rips-machine-gun-kelly-for-dumping-pregnant-megan-fox/">told Kelly to &#8220;grow up&#8221; because</a> Fox is expecting his child.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile, Green has re-shared a screenshot of his direct message with Machine Gun Kelly on his Instagram Stories after the musician messaged him to scream at the actor for repeatedly asking when his baby with Fox is due.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop asking when our child is gonna be born. you the FEDS.&#8221; Kelly recently wrote to Green, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;Quit calling TMZ and focus on that apology you owe me for speaking my name in public.&#8221;</p>



<p>It would seem as if Green is taunting Kelly by asking about the aforementioned due date.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-660x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522291" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-660x1024.jpg 660w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-193x300.jpg 193w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-619x960.jpg 619w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-696x1080.jpg 696w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154.jpg 758w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;You chose the wrong one to f-ck with mr child actor. go back to cereal commercials,&#8221; Kelly added.</p>



<p>This prompted a pretty funny response from Green.</p>



<p>Underneath the photo on his Instagram Stories, Green wrote, &#8220;😂😂😂😂 I didn&#8217;t know &#8216;child actor&#8217; was something bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leo, careful,&#8221; Green continued, seemingly referencing Leonardo DiCaprio, who rose to fame way back in the day on the sitcom Growing Pains. &#8220;He may be coming for you next.&#8221;</p>



<p>Back on February 3, Green wrote in a since-expired Instagram Stories post: </p>



<p>&#8220;Bro. Just be honest for once in your life. Stop caring so much about how you’re perceived that you will try and drag other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Green shares three kids &#8212; Noah Shannon, 12, Bodhi Ransom, 10 and Journey River, 8 &#8212; with Fox.</p>



<p>Despite their divorce, the two clearly remain on good terms.</p>



<p>“I just want the best for her, I want the best for the baby, I want the best for our kids,” added Green a few weeks ago, continuing as follows when it comes to Kelly and Fox no longer being together in the wake of creating a human being:</p>



<p>“That’s a shame. That’s a shame. I’m heartbroken about it because I know she’s been so excited and the kids are so excited for life and the change and all of that.” </p>

<p>Green, for his part, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/sharna-burgess-and-brian-austin-green-welcome-first-child/">welcomed a baby with girlfriend Sharna Burgess</a> in the summer of 2022.</p>



<p>“[Fox] gets along really well with Sharna. Megan trusts her around the boys,” an insider told People Magazine this past December.</p>



<p>“Brian’s a great dad, too. Megan feels fortunate that her boys are loved and always taken care of.”</p>

<p>Brian Austin Green is standing up for his ex-wife.</p>



<p>As you may have heard this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/megan-fox-and-machine-gun-kelly-its-over-again/">Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox have split</a> up&#8230; just one month after we learned that the actress was pregnant with the couple&#8217;s child.</p>



<p>Seriously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/megan-fox-pregnant-2/">Fox just announced</a> this blessed news a few weeks ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="747" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1024x747.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515192" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1024x747.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-768x561.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-2048x1495.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-960x701.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1080x788.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1200x876.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green attend Ferrari Celebrates 60 Years In America on October 11, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for Ferrari North America)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t know many details behind the shocking break-up, but observers have been under the assumption that Machine Gun Kelly is the one who wanted out of the relationship.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Green thinks, at least.</p>



<p>The actor spoke on December 12 to a TMZ cameraman and expressed both surprise and anger over his former spouse no longer being with Kelly, placing the blame for this situation directly on the shoulders of the eccentric musician.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had no idea,&#8221; Green first said when asked about Fox and Kelly ending their romance.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515193" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green attend the Underground Event Screening of Paramount Pictures&#8217; &#8216;TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES&#8217; at UFO Sound Studios on October 5, 2014 in Berlin, Germany.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures International)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After the TMZ reporter alleged that Kelly was unfaithful to his former fiancée, Green replied: </p>



<p>&#8220;How old is he? Do you know? He&#8217;s in his 30s. Nice… In your 30s, like &#8212; I don&#8217;t know. Grow up. She&#8217;s pregnant.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be clear, there&#8217;s been no confirmation that Kelly cheated on Fox.</p>



<p>But Green shares three kids with the brunette beauty (Noah Shannon, 12, Bodhi Ransom, 10 and Journey River, 8) and the two have remained close in the wake of their own divorce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want the best for her, I want the best for the baby, I want the best for our kids,&#8221; added Green in this same interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a shame. That&#8217;s a shame. I&#8217;m heartbroken about it because I know she&#8217;s been so excited and the kids are so excited for life and the change and all of that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Green and Fox have quite the history: </p>



<p>They met in 2004 while filming the sitcom Hope &amp; Faith and then got married in 2010. </p>



<p>The stars went their separate ways at one point during the 2010s, and then got back together, and then ended things for good when Fox filed for divorce from Green in November 2020&#8230; mere days after she and Kelly stepped out as a couple for the first time. </p>



<p>Fox and Kelly got engaged in 2022.</p>

<p>This past March, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/megan-fox-confirms-end-of-machine-gun-kelly-engagement/">Kelly and Fox called off</a> their eventual wedding. But they stayed together.</p>



<p>Green, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/sharna-burgess-and-brian-austin-green-welcome-first-child/">welcomed a baby with girlfriend Sharna Burgess</a> in the summer of 2022.</p>



<p>“[Fox] gets along really well with Sharna. Megan trusts her around the boys,” an insider told People Magazine on Friday, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Brian&#8217;s a great dad, too. Megan feels fortunate that her boys are loved and always taken care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/tori-spelling-had-a-miserable-2023-a-complete-timeline/">Tori Spelling has had a miserable 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Health problems, the mold infestation behind them, searching for a new home, Dean announcing their split, and her hospitalization &#8230; it&#8217;s been so much. <em>Too </em>much.</p>



<p>Despite everything, Tori isn&#8217;t letting the chaos and humiliation destroy her.</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tori Spelling shared this outdoor selfie in April of 2023. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Brian Austin Green has known Tori for a long time. Obviously. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar, they&#8217;re both <em>Beverly Hills 90210</em> alums.</p>



<p>And he spoke <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1385535/brian-austin-green-shares-how-tough-tori-spelling-is-doing-amid-difficult-chapter">to <em>E! News</em></a><em> </em>about how she&#8217;s handling the endless barrage of BS and misery that life has thrown her way.</p>



<p>&#8220;I talked to her today,&#8221; he shared. &#8220;She&#8217;s doing great.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Austin Green returned as a heightened version of himself. He will play David Silver during the filming of the reboot within a reboot. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (FOX)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Assessing her character and fortitude, he then noted: &#8220;Tori is tough.&#8221;</p>



<p>He elaborated: &#8220;She&#8217;s going through stuff that is difficult for her right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is a bit of an understatement, truth be told.</p>

Gorgeous!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;ll absolutely get through it,&#8221; Brian Austin Green affirmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; he predicted, &#8220;it&#8217;ll make her a stronger person.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh really? If the rest of 2023 ends up being like her spring and summer have been, she&#8217;ll be able to juggle bowling balls by January.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On social media, Tori Spelling models a stylish and comfortable-looking garment. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering why anyone is asking for BAG&#8217;s thoughts on Tori, well, they&#8217;re reuniting this weekend.</p>



<p>90s Con 2023 began Friday, September 15 in Tampa, Florida. Yes, 90s Con. Feel old yet?</p>



<p>A number of Beverly Hills, 90210 actors united there, including Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, and Jason Priestley. Plus Brian and Tori.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Once again at Urgent Care with her family, Tori Spelling shared photos to warn followers about the hidden dangers of mold. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This spring, Tori Spelling shared that she had found the culprit behind the months and months of medical mysteries and even hospitalizations that her family had faced.</p>



<p>The family home &#8212; a rental &#8212; had a mold infestation that rendered it unsafe for human habitation. Unsafe for many other animals, also.</p>



<p>Chronic exposure to the mold spores had taken a toll on their health.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this lengthy caption from May 2023, Tori Spelling shared her family&#8217;s story of repeated illnesses. The culprit? Dangerous mold in their home.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So, even after they left the home, they did not immediately escape the long-term effects of mold exposure.</p>



<p>As many of Tori&#8217;s followers quickly warned her, these symptoms could persist for months or even years.</p>



<p>With that in mind, Tori signaled her plans to undergo brain scans (along with the rest of her family). Chronic mold exposure can lead to chronic inflammation of the brain. Which is, for the record, bad for you.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taking to her Instagram Story, Tori Spelling revealed that she and her family members need to undergo brain scans after living with an extremely hazardous mold infestation.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And then, of course, came the house-hunting. Tori and Dean may be famous, but they&#8217;re not exactly loaded. Especially not with five (amazing) kids to feed and clothe.</p>



<p>Then Dean announced the end of their marriage. He deleted the post, but not the sentiment.</p>



<p>We hope that Brian Austin Green is right. Maybe Tori will only grow stronger from her miserable girl summer.</p>
