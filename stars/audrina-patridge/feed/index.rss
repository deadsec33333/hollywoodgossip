<p>Tragic news from Audrina Patridge today.</p>



<p>The star of MTV&#8217;s <em>The Hills</em> revealed on Instagram that her 15-year-old niece Sadie Loza has passed away unexpectedly.</p>



<p>Audrina shared a carousel of photos of Sadie, including several in which aunt and niece enjoyed the warm glow of each other&#8217;s company.</p>



<p>She captioned the post with a loving tribute to Sadie.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Audrina Patridge revealed this week that her niece has passed away. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;My heart hurts to even write this. My beautiful niece is now in heaven,&#8221; Audrina wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know [it&#8217;s] not goodbye forever, but it is the hardest to say goodbye for now,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will miss you and cherish every single moment we had with you. Rest in peace Say Say!! We love you forever &amp; ever!&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sadie Loza was just 15 years old. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Sadie was the daughter of Audrina&#8217;s sister, Casey Patridge Loza, who also paid tribute to the departed teen,</p>



<p>&#8220;Sadie Raine Loza has left this Earth for the heavens,&#8221; she wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;Writing this was the hardest thing I ever have had to do.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Audrina Patridge was forced to say goodbye to her niece Sadie this week. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Her story will save countless lives, her memory will never be forgotten. Rest In Peace you brilliant starseed,&#8221; Casey concluded.</p>



<p>Casey went on to say that she lacked the proper words to express her grief, but that she found comfort in recalling Sadie&#8217;s favorite physics lesson, which may offer a key to understanding the joy of life and the pan of death.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first law of thermodynamics aka (Law of Conservation of Energy) works in all spheres of life…..&#8217;Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another,'&#8221; she wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;Transformation is a better word than death.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sadie Loza was the niece of Audrina Patridge. She passed away at the age of 15. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Many of Audrina&#8217;s celebrity friends offered their condolences in the comments section of her post.</p>



<p>Brody Jenner wrote, &#8220;So so sorry for your loss Audrina. This is heartbreaking. Sending love to you and the family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kristin Cavallari commented, &#8220;Omgggg this kills me.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kristin Cavallari starred with Audrina Patridge on The Hills. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Audrina! I’m so so sorry! sending all the love and light to you and your family,&#8221; wrote Rachel Bilson.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sending you and your family lots of love,&#8221; offered Ashley Greene.</p>



<p>News of Sadie&#8217;s passing comes just one week after Audrina gathered with family to celebrate her niece&#8217;s fifteenth birthday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Audrina during her time on MTV.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I cant believe youre 15,&#8221; Casey wrote on Instagram at the time. &#8220;it feels like the years flew by and we still have so many more adventures to go on! aliens in sedona, portals, learning to drive in the desert hahah.&#8221;</p>



<p>No cause of death has been revealed, but based on comments from her loved ones, it seems that Sadie had been bravely battling some form of chronic illness.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to the entire Patridge family during this enormously difficult time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this time it&#8217;s not over something as simple as whether or not their daughter is allowed on camera.</p>
<p>She has been granted a temporary restraining order protecting both her and her daughter and accuses her ex of domestic abuse.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Not for the first time, Audrina Patridge has been granted a temporary restraining order against her awful baby daddy, Corey Bohan.</p>
<p>The order was requested and granted on the grounds of allegations of recent domestic violence.</p>
<p>Last week, she filed an emergency motion on behalf of both herself and her young daughter, Kirra.</p>
<p>Sadly but notably, this is not the first time that Audrina has had to seek legal protection from her ex-husband.</p>
<p>Their marriage ended after less than a year amid domestic violence accusations.</p>

<p>According to documents obtained by <a href="https://theblast.com/c/the-hills-audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-domestic-violence-restraining-order"><em>The Blast</em></a>, Corey Bohan will literally have to keep his distance.</p>
<p>He is required to stay 100 yards away from Audrina, from Kirra, from Audrina&#8217;s home, and from Kirra&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>Until the investigation is complete, he is also denied any and all visitation with his daughter.</p>
<p>Restraining orders can feel like a hollow gesture, especially when taken out to prevent brutal violence.</p>
<p>But we hope that this is enough to keep Audrina and Kirra safe.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The majority of the details of the restraining order have been sealed by the court.</p>
<p>However, we do know the most recent incident of alleged abuse.</p>
<p>Audrina lists that as &quot;May 2019, continuing to present.&quot;</p>
<p>Additionally, Audrina is seeking full custody of Kirra.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether mother, daughter, or both are said to be the primary targets of violence in this case.</p>
<p>Even with much of the information sealed, it seems likely that further details will come out as this case continues.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Corey Bohan has already had the nerve to address this on social media.</p>
<p>Taking to his private Instagram, Corey seemed to suggest that he plans to fight Audrina in court.</p>
<p>&quot;Keyword TEMPORARY,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Corey then added a chilling: &quot;to be continued &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>You know, a lot of alleged abusers get described as master manipulators who make themselves seem kind an innocent to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Corey&#8217;s message sounds vague but a little menacing. He might as well have written &quot;<em>that won&#8217;t protect you forever!</em>&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="826" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-826x1024.png" alt="Audrina Patridge Baby Photo" class="wp-image-246287" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-826x1024.png 826w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-242x300.png 242w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-768x952.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-735x912.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-270x335.png 270w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-280x347.png 280w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-419x520.png 419w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-516x640.png 516w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-619x768.png 619w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-774x960.png 774w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo-871x1080.png 871w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/audrina-patridge-baby-photo.png 941w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Corey has certainly managed to make life difficult for Audrina, even in ways not involving alleged violence.</p>
<p><em>The Hills: New Beginnings</em> began filming in late 2018.</p>
<p>At the time, Corey was adamant that Kirra not have any role in filming.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t just something that he demanded &#8212; he got a court order to that effect.</p>
<p>This spring, however, it was revealed that he had &quot;somehow&quot; changed his mind &#8230; after Audrina refusd to sign their divorce papers until he gave the go-ahead for Kirra to film.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We do not know the context in which the most recent domestic violence allegedly took place.</p>
<p>This is very upsetting to hear &#8212; for Audrina&#8217;s sake but especially for young Kirra&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Kirra is only three years old.</p>
<p>We hope that the investigation and the court&#8217;s conclusions will reflect justice and the safety of Kirra.</p>

<p>It was the abuse accusations that Audrina has leveled against Corey that has people much more concerned.</p>

<p><a href="/2017/09/audrina-patridge-details-horrific-abuse-claims-against-corey-boh/">Audrina Patridge&#8217;s abuse claims against Corey Bohan</a> are, frankly, disturbing.</p>
<p>Corey is accused of primarily emotional abuse, displaying anger issues and instability that at the very least make him a potential danger to himself.</p>
<p>According to Audrina, he has even shoved her while she was holding their baby daughter, Kirra.</p>
<p>Corey has reportedly also done things like empty out Audrina&#8217;s purse and harm himself in her presence, effectively blackmailing her into staying with him or he&#8217;ll &quot;do worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Based upon that, a divorce sounds like absolutely the right call.</p>
<p>They were together for 9 years and got married last November, so we are anxious to know if this had been going on in a gradually escalating manner all along &#8230; or if this is an altogether new behavior that manifested since they were married.</p>
<p>We wonder if there&#8217;s some newly emerged medical issue that could be driving this &#8230; but either way, this couple shouldn&#8217;t be together.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, when you&#8217;ve been an item for almost an entire decade, it&#8217;s difficult to extricate yourselves from each other&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>For example, they&#8217;ve been living in the same house &#8230; which is what brought them into conflict.</p>
<p>Thus, this new incident.</p>
<p><em>Entertainment Tonight</em> <a href="http://www.etonline.com/corey-bohan-responds-audrina-patridges-restraining-order-she-requests-he-be-forced-out-their-home">obtained court</a> documents that show both Audrina and Corey&#8217;s versions of what happened.</p>
<p>What they can both agree on?</p>
<p>Audrina and her father, Mark, returned to Audrina&#8217;s home in Irvine, California with the intention of collecting Audrina&#8217;s belongings.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Within the court documents, Audrina alleges that Corey is &quot;holding all of my personal possessions and my home hostage.&quot;</p>
<p>Audrina has stated that the house in which the couple lived was hers prior to their marriage.</p>
<p>More than that, the two apparently have a prenup agreement that confirms that yes, Audrina is the sole owner of the house and will remain that.</p>
<p>But, presumably because she is the one who fled from the home with Kirra and took up temporary residence at the home of her parents, a judge denied Audrina&#8217;s request to have Corey removed from her house.</p>
<p>(Which sounds super unfair, but I imagine that laws are structured to make it difficult for one spouse to render the other homeless during a dispute &#8212; just a guess, though)</p>
<p>When Audrina&nbsp;went with her parents, Corey allegedly cursed her out &#8212; part of a pattern that she has described in which he uses expletives and yells and cannot seem to keep from doing so in front of their baby.</p>
<p>Audrina also accuses Corey of having installed additional surveillance devices in her house.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;ll recall, Audrina&#8217;s&nbsp;initial claims when they split and she sought a restraining order mentioned that part of Corey&#8217;s emotional abuse involved installing cameras in their home that he used to spy on her)</p>
<p>She is once again imploring the court to remove Corey from her home.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Corey&#8217;s side claims that Audrina and her family &quot;literally barging in the house through the garage door&quot; with only 15 minutes of notice.</p>
<p>He says that he&#8217;d asked them to arrange a time when he wouldn&#8217;t be there.</p>
<p>He claims that he hasn&#8217;t installed any new surveillance devices, that the only cameras are a nanny cam in the living room and a camera by the front door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corey claims that he did not yell or curse but merely &quot;spoke calmly&quot; to the Patridges, and says that Audrina&#8217;s father, Mark, was trying to instigate a fight.</p>
<p>No matter what you believe about this couple and their conflicts, no part of this sounds good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The&nbsp;Audrina Patridge-Corey&nbsp;Bohan divorce has quickly taken a turn for the very ugly.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported that the f<a href="/2017/09/audrina-patridge-and-corey-bohan-its-over/">ormer Hills stars were splitting</a> after nearly a year of marriage and nearly nine years of being together overall.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We weren&#8217;t sure why.</p>
<p>We thought maybe becoming parents to a little girl naked Kirra last June had placed a strain on their marriage.</p>
<p>It turns out, however, that the reason is far more troubling and insidious.</p>
<p>On Monday, September 18, Patridge was granted a restraining order against Bohan for what a source describes to People Magazine as ongoing instances of &ldquo;emotional abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More specifically and most troubling, there was an incident in mid-April, legal documents claim, during which Audrina says Corey shoved her while she was holding Kirra in her arms.</p>
<p>The couple was arguing about Bohan&rsquo;s alleged infidelity when he proceeded to empty out her purse and punch himself in the head, threatening to do even more damage if she left him.</p>
<p>This was the second time in a few weeks, Patridge claims, that Bohan&nbsp;had talked of suicide.</p>
<p>She also references an incident on September 6, saying Bohan started calling her names and harassing her after she returned home.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Grow some balls and pull the trigger and file for divorce,&rdquo; Bohan supposedly yelled at her at the time, prompting Patridge to call the police and file a report.</p>
<p>Just over a week later, child protective services came to the residence to meet with her.</p>
<p>This past weekend, Bohan showed up for a panel discussion Patridge was taking part in&hellip; followed her on stage &#8230; and demanded to know their daughter&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>&quot;I was shaking at this point,&quot; Audrina says in her legal documents.</p>
<p>She asked for a restraining order the next day.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/09/21/audrina-patridge-divorce-documents-restraining-order-violated-custody/">Bohan allegedly showed up</a> on September 19 and refused to leave Audrina&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>He installed five video cameras around the premises to keep tabs on her and called her a &quot;f-cking cunt.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I am fearful of [Corey&rsquo;s] temper because he cannot control his swearing and personal attacks on me, even when in the presence of our young daughter,&quot; writes Audrina.</p>
<p>The restraining order requires Bohan to remain at least 100 feet away from his estranged wife, his daughter and even his dog.</p>
<p>As for the divorce, Patridge is demanding primary physical and legal custody of 15-month-old&nbsp;Kirra.</p>
<p>She is asking a judge to shut&nbsp;Bohan down if he asks for spousal support.</p>
<p>And, finally, she wants an order specifically prohibiting Bohan from taking Kirra to his native land of Australia.</p>
<p>Talk about a terrible ending to what had appeared to have been a stable love story.</p>
<p>Patridge and Bohan had been together since 2008, remaining close even throughout filming of The Hills, an unusual development for couples that appear on reality television.</p>
<p>Alas, the relationship has ended on the most sour of notes.</p>
<p>For the sake of their young daughter, let&#8217;s hope Audrina and Corey find a way to work this out as amicably as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>For&nbsp;Audrina Patridge, The Hills are no longer alive with the sound of true love.</p>
<p>Terrible puns aside, the truth of this unfortunate matter remains:</p>
<p>The former MTV star has filed for divorce from husband&nbsp;Corey Bohan.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The couple <a href="/2016/11/audrina-patridge-and-corey-bohan-married/">got married in November in Hawaii</a>, finally making their relationship legal after many, many years together. Approximately eight, to be exact.</p>
<p>Patridge and Bohan are the parents to a little girl named Kira, who was born in June of 2016 and who will remain the priority for both halves of this now-former romance going forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Audrina&rsquo;s No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time,&quot; <a href="http://www.etonline.com/audrina-patridge-files-divorce-husband-corey-bohan-87773">Patridge&#8217;s rep told Entertainment Tonight</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>A united front ever since The Hills was a major hit on MTV, Patridge and Bohan appeared to be an exception to the rule that most couples who get together on reality television eventually fall apart.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Back in December, Audrina talked to Entertainment Tonight about how she and Bohan planned to avoid a break up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve been through all those pitfalls, I feel like, before we got married,&quot; she said at the time, explaining:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We experienced the reality side of it, the made-up stories in the tabloids, other people trying to get in between us and the gossip and the rumors&hellip;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like we are so grounded now and we have each other&#8217;s backs no matter what&hellip; people can&#8217;t just try to come in between us and tell us lies. It&#8217;s like, &#8216;No, that&#8217;s not true.&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, what went wrong?</p>

<p>We may never know exactly.</p>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="/2017/09/audrina-patridge-details-horrific-abuse-claims-against-corey-boh/">We do know. And it&#8217;s very ugly</a>.)</p>
<p>But in this same ET interview, Patridge did say that having a young child at home was a strain on the pair&#8217;s marriage.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been hard&hellip; we haven&#8217;t really been on a date just him and I since we had the baby,&rdquo; Patridge said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;We have a calendar now&hellip; and it&#8217;s really nice because I&#8217;ll give Kirra a bath every night and get her ready for bed and put her to sleep and he&#8217;ll cook us dinner, so there&#8217;s a balance.&quot;</p>
<p>It can be difficult to find time for romance when a couple also must find time (A LOT of time!) for a tiny human being at home.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause of their split, we wish Audrina and Corey the very best in the future.</p>
