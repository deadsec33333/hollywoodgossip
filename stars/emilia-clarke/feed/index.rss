<p>With expectations so absurdly high, we suppose it was inevitable that <a href="/2019/04/game-of-thrones-was-the-battle-of-winterfell-a-king-size-disappo/">some fans would find themselves disappointed</a> after the dust settled.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="515" height="661" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew.jpg" alt="Aunt and Nephew" class="wp-image-326760" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew.jpg 515w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew-234x300.jpg 234w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew-261x335.jpg 261w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew-270x347.jpg 270w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew-405x520.jpg 405w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/04/aunt-and-nephew-499x640.jpg 499w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /><figcaption>(HBO)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Viewers complained that the low lighting combined with the frequent jump cuts made it difficult to follow the action.</p>
<p>Others griped about the writing, arguing that more top-tier characters should have been snuffed out, both for the sake of believability (they were battling a massive army of zombies, after all) and for the emotional payoff (the previous episode seemed to set the stage for several tearjerker send-offs).</p>
<p>(Sure, Theon and Jorah bit the dust, but was anyone harboring a strong emotional attachment to either character?)</p>

<p>While those critiques are certainly valid, defenders of the episode pointed out that viewers had never previously witnessed anything of its kind.</p>
<p>Many reminded the haters that it&#8217;s a freakin&#8217; miracle what this show has been able to accomplish over the course of its eight seasons, and in just three weeks&#8217; time, we&#8217;ll never again have the pleasure of dissecting and arguing over a new episode of GoT.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there&#8217;s unrest in the kingdom.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s only one person who could possibly unite these warring factions at this crucial time.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re talking of course, about the Mother of Dragons, the Breaker of Chains, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea herself &#8212; Emilia Clarke.</p>
<p>Clarke appeared on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> Thursday night, and she issued an unexpected proclamation to GoT obsessives:</p>
<p>Apparently, nothing we&#8217;ve seen up to this point can prepare us for what lies ahead in episode five.</p>
<p>&quot;Episode five is bigger,&quot; Clarke said in response to Kimmel&#8217;s queries about the Battle of Winterfell.</p>

<p>&quot;Episode five is, I mean, four and five and six, they&#8217;re all insane, but like&#8230; Find the biggest TV you can.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, actors always hype their upcoming projects on talk shows, but we know better than to question the Khaleesi.</p>
<p>If Emilia says the best is yet to come, we&#8217;re inclined to believe her.</p>
<p>Of course, raising expectations means setting the stage for further butthurt disappointment, but this show is well accustomed to dividing its fanbase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything about <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> &#8212; from the lead&#8217;s casting to whatever backstory they&#8217;ve given a beloved character to the fact that this story introduces yet another white brunette&nbsp;leading lady &#8212; is bound to be controversial.</p>
<p>Get excited, or angry, or nervous along with fans and watch the highly anticipated story teaser trailer below!</p>
<p>And check out Donald Glover&#8217;s comments about playing the iconic&nbsp;Lando Calrissian.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The IMDB synopsis of <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> is very succinct:</p>
<p>&quot;During an adventure into a dark criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his future copilot Chewbacca and encounters Lando Calrissian years before joining the Rebellion.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to get people excited in this film.</p>
<p>True, many people feel that there&#8217;s no way that anyone can live up to Harrison Ford as Han Solo.</p>
<p>Also true, there were apparently some difficulties in the film&#8217;s production, to the point that they switched directors.</p>
<p>And, admittedly, as wonderful as Emilia Clarke is, we&#8217;re starting to get the impression that every woman in Star Wars is in fact a white brunette. (Rey, Jyn Erso, Leia, Padme)</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at the positives.</p>
<p>It looks like there&#8217;s going to be some sort of heist, and I am <em>all about</em> some heist movies. Especially in a science fiction setting. (Yes, I know that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> is technically science fantasy &#8230; my excitement stands)</p>
<p>The cast includes Donald Glover (<em>Community</em>, <em>Atlanta</em>), Emilia Clarke (<em>Game of Thrones</em>), Woody Harrelson (I&#8217;m straight up not going to list stuff because he&#8217;s been in so many great things), and Thandie Newton (<em>Westword, The Chronicles of Riddick</em>).</p>
<p>And, from the teasers that we&#8217;ve seen so far, it looks like there&#8217;s going to be some sort of Dark Sided individual whose nature we don&#8217;t know. It doesn&#8217;t look like an Inquisitor (because he lacks a lightsaber), so &#8230; we&#8217;ll all find out together.</p>
<p>At the start, Han Solo is trying to enlist in the Empire in an effort to become a pilot. As we all know, life will end up taking him in a very different direction.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We cannot strongly enough emphasize that everyone&#8217;s reaction to the TV spot during the Superbowl was a positive response to seeing Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian. Wearing black fur.</p>
<p>Seriously, the delight was almost universal.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Us Weekly</em>, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/solo-a-star-wars-story-first-teaser-trailer-airs-during-super-bowl/">Donald Glover reveals</a> what little he can about his experience becoming part of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember going on set one of the first times and [Howard] was like, &lsquo;Yeah, I want to follow you onto the Millennium Falcon and do this.&rsquo; I was like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen the outside go into the inside.&rsquo; And he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Yeah, no one&rsquo;s ever done that shot.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never really thought about it, but you normally only see the Millennium Falcon from the outside or from the interior. It looks like viewers will be getting a tour of what it looks like when you enter the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;As a fan, I was like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m really excited!&rsquo; For me, it was a dream.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re sure that he&#8217;d have liked to share more, but he cannot.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speaking to <em>ABC</em>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/director-ron-howard-dishes-upcoming-han-solo-star/story?id=51179908">Ron Howard spoke</a> of directing the film but refused to leak any spoilers.</p>
<p>&quot;Those are challenging projects. And they take, you know, a lot of very talented people&rsquo;s energy to try to live up to the legacy of Star Wars and everything that it means.&quot;</p>
<p>No one person can control the fate of <em>Star Wars</em>. There&#8217;s an entire team that makes sure that everything is consistent with established canon and lore and with future plans for the franchise before production begins.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, no spoilers coming from me but I had a great experience and I think fans are going to really enjoy it.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a contrast. Famously, when a reporter asked George Lucas what titular &quot;phantom menace&quot; was before the release of <em>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>, Lucas simply replied &quot;Palpatine.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike George Lucas, however, Ron Howard actually has to answer to Disney.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>A lot of fans are somewhat hesitant to become excited about <em>Solo</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot that can go wrong when you&#8217;re telling a character&#8217;s backstory. Many fans already felt slighted by Han Solo&#8217;s portrayal in <em>The Force Awakens</em>.</p>
<p>And, speaking of the Sequel Trilogy, <em>The Last Jedi</em> was a controversial film among <em>Star Wars</em> fans. Many felt that there were poor decisions made with respect to characterization, pacing, continuity, and the canon of the series.</p>
<p>(Gotta admit that I&#8217;m one of those fans; the review that I wrote up was like 11 pages because I had a <em>lot </em>to say)</p>
<p>Those fans who felt massively disappointed by the most recent film are leery of getting themselves hyped for a new movie that no one really asked for.</p>
<p>That said &#8230; I know that <em>I&#8217;m</em> going to see it. Watch the trailer and decide if you&#8217;re going to see it, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Just over a year ago,&nbsp;Emilia Clarke appeared on Conan and made a plea for Game of Thrones to <a href="/videos/emilia-clarke-we-must-free-the-penis-on-game-of-thrones/">FREE THE PENIS</a>!</p>
<p>Alas, the epic HBO drama still depicts more female nudity than male nudity on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But at least Clarke can sleep well at night, knowing she did her best to help women around the world out a bit.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In an interview with the latest issue of Rolling Stone, meanwhile, the actress said it took her awhile to realize just what sort of effect her gender has had on her life since since she struck it big.</p>
<p>Men all over the Internet may search for&nbsp;<a href="/2016/05/emilia-clarke-nude-scene-were-those-stunt-boobs/">Emilia Clarke nude</a> photos because they&#8217;re young and horny, while fans of this series may joke about how many times they&#8217;ve seen Clarke topless&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; but the star sort of woke up one day and realized that sexism is alive and not very well.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;re aware of it, and you&#8217;re aware of it, but one day, you go, &#8216;Oh, my God, it&#8217;s everywhere!&#8217; Like you suddenly wake up to it and you go, &#8216;Wait a fucking second, are you&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;are you treating me different because I&#8217;ve got a pair of tits? Is that actually happening?&#8217;&quot; she says to Rolling Stone, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It took me a really long time to see that I do get treated differently. But I look around, and that&#8217;s my daily life.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke is aware she&#8217;s fortunate.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s aware that she was named <a href="/2015/10/emilia-clarke-named-sexiest-woman-alive/">Esquire&#8217;s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015</a> and that her looks have helped to further her career.</p>
<p>But she still has an important message to send:</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#8217;t stop me from being a feminist. Like, guess what?</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I&#8217;ve got mascara on, and I also have a high IQ, so those two things can be one and the same.&quot;</p>

<p>As Game of Thrones embarks on its final two seasons (yes, <em>EVER</em>!), Clarke&#8217;s character is finally setting sail for Westeros.</p>
<p>She is finally taking the climactic steps toward the Iron Throne, following many years of being one of the biggest female bad asses on television.</p>
<p>&quot;Women have been great rulers,&quot; she says of her role and the challenging world in which she&#8217;s acting these days.</p>
<p>&quot;And then for that to be a character that I&#8217;m known to play? That&#8217;s so f-cking lucky. Anyone who seems to think that it&#8217;s not needed need only look at the political environment we&#8217;re all living in to be like, &#8216;Oh, no, it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is needed.&quot;</p>
<p>It really is.</p>

<p>And while we do care a lot about feminism and politics and equality and strong women, we need to know from Clarke:</p>
<p>Can she reveal any <a href="/2017/06/game-of-thrones-season-7-spoilers-who-dies-whats-jon-snows-real/">Game of Thrones Season 7 spoilers</a>?</p>
<p>&quot;Spoiler alert &#8211; I normally don&#8217;t spend very much time in Belfast, but this last season I spent a little more time there,&quot; she teases.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a really interesting season in terms of some loose ends that have been tied, some really satisfying plot points, some things where you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Oh, my God. I forgot about that!&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;Rumors are going to be confirmed or denied.&quot;</p>
<p>One rumor going around if that a Game of Thrones spinoff (or <em>four</em> <a href="/2017/05/game-of-thrones-four-different-spinoffs-in-the-works/">Games of Thrones spinoffs</a>) is in the works.</p>
<p>This may be the case, but don&#8217;t expect to see Clarke as&nbsp;Daenerys Targaryes in any of them.</p>

<p>&quot;I am doing one more season. And then that&#8217;ll be it,&quot; she says to Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>We get it. We get that Clarke likely wants to spread her wings and try something else.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just going to miss Emilia Clarke,&nbsp;Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains&#8230; Talker &#8216;Bout Boobies. We&#8217;re gonna miss her a lot.</p>
