<p>Elon Musk has taken a lot of heat for his business and political decisions (from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/elon-musk-completes-purchase-of-twitter-immediately-fires-rivals-within-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying Twitter</a> to supporting President Donald Trump to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performing a Nazi-like salute</a> at the inauguration), but his love life has also led to much interest.</p>



<p>Before he was cozying up to Trump, Elon was cozying up to alternative singer Grimes. The former couple have three children, and their relationship has had quite a few twists and turns, but they seem to be done for good.</p>



<p>Elon&#8217;s three marriages and other relationships have made headlines. Musk also has a large brood of children, and he&#8217;s been open about why he&#8217;s decided to father many kids.</p>

<p>As the SpaceX CEO continues to stir up controversy as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, get to know more about Elon&#8217;s romantic past here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elon-musk-s-past-marriages">Elon Musk&#8217;s Past Marriages</h2>



<p>Elon&#8217;s relationship with Grimes has been his most publicized, but the X (formerly Twitter) owner has been married three times to two women.</p>



<p>Elon&#8217;s first marriage was to Canadian author Justine Wilson from 2000 until 2008. The pair first met while they were students at  Queen&#8217;s University in Canada, and they briefly dated in college.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1024x683.jpg" alt="SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk speaks during an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania." class="wp-image-518231" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk speaks during an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After graduating and going their separate ways, the couple reunited a few years later, when Elon invited Justine to Silicon Valley. The author detailed their romance in a <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5380/millionaire-starter-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal essay</a> for <em>Marie Claire </em>in 2010.</p>



<p>Following the death of their first son and Elon&#8217;s intense work schedule, Justine wrote that the marriage began to falter. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was a dream lifestyle, privileged and surreal. But the whirlwind of glitter couldn&#8217;t disguise a growing void at the core,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>Despite &#8220;some anger&#8221; and complicated divorce proceedings, Justine also wrote that she didn&#8217;t &#8220;regret&#8221; the marriage or divorce in that personal essay.</p>

Santiago/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elon&#8217;s second marriage was to actress Talulah Riley. The pair started dating shortly after he filed for divorce from Justine. They married in 2010, but they divorced in 2012.</p>



<p>Despite splitting up after two years of marriage, they worked out their differences and remarried in 2013. Still, Elon filed for divorce for a short time in 2014, but the couple split up for good in 2016.</p>



<p>Even though the marriage didn&#8217;t last, it appears that the <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>actress doesn&#8217;t have many hard feelings about the relationship ending. </p>

<p>&#8220;I loved/love the guy, so I’m incredibly subjective in my opinion, cannot be unbiased and shouldn’t be expected to be either,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/talulah-riley-elon-musk-marriage-twitter-m05nmcmvt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times </a></em>in 2024. She also recalled that all her weddings were &#8220;lovely.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Elon Musk divorced Tallulah, he briefly dated actress Amber Heard, before linking up with Grimes. Actress Natasha Bassett and attorney Nicole Shanahan are other rumored flings. He denied any link to Nicole.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elon-musk-s-relationship-with-grimes">Elon Musk&#8217;s Relationship With Grimes</h2>



<p>Elon and Grimes&#8217; relationship has had its share of ups and downs. While many people may be familiar with their romance, the pair never actually tied the knot. Despite never marrying the pair share three kids.</p>



<p>Grimes and Elon have had a bit of an on-and-off dynamic for a few years, but it seems like they&#8217;re done for good as of 2025. Still, the &#8220;Oblivion&#8221; singer seemingly tries to maintain a good relationship to co-parent their kids.</p>



<p>Despite the split, Grimes has caught strays for her ex&#8217;s actions. The tech entrepreneur faced backlash for his Nazi-like salute at Trump&#8217;s rally, and fans called on Grimes to speak out.</p>



<p>Grimes spoke about their children in response to fans asking her to denounce him.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I deeply respect your concern- it is unhealthy that people are this upset when I have not even been online yet today and am only just learning about this controversy now. I don&#039;t know what happened and I will not make a rash statement &#8211; I am not a citizen of this country.…</p>&mdash; 𝖦𝗋𝗂𝗆𝖾𝗌 ⏳ (@Grimezsz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1881618420367507941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote>



<p>&#8220;I am not him. I will not make a statement every time he does something,&#8221;  she <a href="https://x.com/Grimezsz/status/1881618420367507941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;To be clear i could go talk s**t and be on a bunch of magazine covers and be a feminist hero and get clout &#8211; but it would serve no purpose. I choose my children&#8217;s wellbeing,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-current-relationship-status">His Current Relationship Status</h2>



<p>While Elon has been in the public eye even more since Trump&#8217;s win in the 2024 election, his romantic partners have been incredibly dubious. </p>



<p>Amidst his confusing relationship with Grimes, people have also speculated that he&#8217;s dating Neuralink executive Shivon Zillis, with whom he shares two kids.</p>



<p>While their relationship status is not confirmed, Shivon did accompany Elon to Trump&#8217;s inauguration in January 2025, according to <em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/elon-musk-relationship-marriage-history-2018037">Newsweek</a>.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elon-musk-s-children">Elon Musk&#8217;s Children</h2>

<p>Throughout his relationships, Elon has fathered 14 children (that we know of) by four different women. He has shown support for the &#8220;pro-natalist&#8221; movement, according to <em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/elon-musks-12-children-why-he-has-so-many-1987776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a></em>. The movement encourages people to have large families to prevent population decline.</p>



<p>Elon has also encouraged followers to reproduce rapidly on X. &#8220;Population collapse is coming&#8230; Earth is almost empty of humans,&#8221; he wrote, per <em><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/i-wouldnt-call-it-eugenics-as-such-how-elon-musks-views-might-influence-donald-trumps-policies-13261496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky News</a></em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;Instead of teaching fear of pregnancy we should teach fear of childlessness,&#8221; Elon continued.</p>



<p>The tech entrepreneur&#8217;s father Errol Musk has also supported the movement. &#8220;We are here to continue being here. We should all be worried about declining populations, any country with any industry should be worried,&#8221; he told <em>Sky News.</em></p>

<p>Elon and Justine had six children during their marriage. Their first, son Nevada Alexander Musk, died at 10 weeks old from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2002.</p>



<p>They had twins Griffin and Vivian in 2004 and triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006. In 2022, Vivian came out as transgender and legally changed her name. </p>



<p>After linking up with Grimes, she gave birth to her and Elon&#8217;s first child X Æ A-Xii in May 2020. The pair caught some heat for the difficult-to-pronounce name.

<p>Grimes revealed that she privately gave birth to a daughter Exa Dark Sideræl Musk in December 2021 in a <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair </a></em>profile in March 2022. In 2023, it was revealed that the pair had a third child, another son.</p>



<p>In October 2023, Grimes sued Elon for parental rights, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/grimes-sues-elon-musk-parental-rights-rcna118608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>NBC News</em>. </a></p>



<p>Shortly before Grimes gave birth to their daughter, Elon fathered twins via IVF with Neuralink Director of Operations Shivon Zillis in November 2021.</p>



<p>In February, conservative influencer <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/ashley-st-clair-welcomes-elon-musks-13th-child-says-billionaire-is-a-deadbeat-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley St. Clair revealed that she had a child by Musk</a>.</p>

<p>Vivian is very outspoken about her political opinions and opposing her father. </p>



<p>Elon has said that she was &#8220;killed by the woke mind virus,&#8221; per <em><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a></em>. Vivian has not held back in calling out her dad.</p>



<p>In addition to firing back at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/megan-fox-responds-to-claims-that-she-forces-her-sons-to-wear-girls-clothes-elon-musk-gets-involved-for-some-reason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his transphobic comments</a>, she has also claimed that he was mostly absent as a parental figure during her childhood. &#8220;He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic,&#8221; she told NBC.</p>



<p>As her father has courted controversy with his political opinions, Vivian has routinely called him out on social media. She also revealed that her mom Justine is very supportive of her.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is a father. Once again.</p>



<p>The controversial billionaire, who is basically serving as co-President to Donald Trump these days and ripping the federal government apart, has welcomed a son with Shivon Zilis.</p>



<p>The newborn is Musk&#8217;s 14th child overall and his fourth with Zilis.</p>

<p>The occasional lovers  00 who also share twins Strider and Azure, 3, as well as 12-month-old Arcadia &#8211;announced the arrival of son Seldon Lycurgus on social media February 28.</p>



<p>&#8220;Discussed with Elon and, in light of beautiful Arcadia’s birthday, we felt it was better to also just share directly about our wonderful and incredible son Seldon Lycurgus,&#8221; Zilis wrote on Twitter. </p>



<p>&#8220;Built like a juggernaut, with a solid heart of gold. Love him so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not very long ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/vivian-wilson-elon-musks-daughter-says-she-found-out-about-his-13th-kid-on-social-media/">Musk became a father</a> for the 13th time.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s also been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/grimes-posts-public-plea-to-elon-musk-please-stop-ignoring-our-childs-medical-crisis/">accused by a different baby mama</a> (Grimes) of ignoring their child&#8217;s ongoing medical needs.</p>

<p>The Tesla founder and Zilis revealed in November 2021 they secretly welcomed their twins. </p>



<p>These kids were born just weeks before Musk and musician Grimes welcomed a baby girl, Exa Dark Sideræl, via a surrogate, according to court documents published by Insider in July 2021.</p>



<p>&#8220;All our friends and family know,&#8221; Musk told Page Six at the time about the twins. &#8220;Failure to issue a press release, which would be bizarre, does not mean &#8216;secret.&#8217;</p>

<p>Not even three years later, the pair welcomed their third child together, Arcadia. </p>



<p>This past Friday, Zilis celebrated her daughter&#8217;s first birthday with an social media post that read as follows: &#8220;Happy 1st birthday, darling Arcadia. Mommy loves you with all her heart.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zilis is an artificial intelligence specialist who has worked at Musk&#8217;s Neuralink and previously explained why she wanted to have kids with the possible sociopath.</p>



<p>&#8220;He really wants smart people to have kids, so he encouraged me to,&#8221; Zilis is quoted as saying in Walter Isaacson&#8217;s 2023 biography Elon Musk. </p>



<p>&#8220;If the choice is between an anonymous sperm donor or doing it with the person you admire most in the world, for me that was a pretty f&#8211;king easy decision.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly think of genes I would prefer for my children.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a recent interview with journalist Kara Swisher, Hillary Clinton accused Elon Musk of threatening to &#8220;rape&#8221; Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>The allegation stems from comments that the Tesla CEO and X owner made in response to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-says-shes-choosing-calm-over-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s endorsement of Kamala Harris</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fine Taylor … you win…I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life,&#8221; Musk wrote on the social media platform he purchased in 2022.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-musk-s-attempt-at-humor-falls-flat">Musk&#8217;s Attempt at Humor Falls Flat</h2>



<p>Taylor referenced <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jennifer-aniston-trashes-jd-vance-cannot-believe-his-view-on-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.D. Vance&#8217;s &#8220;childless cat lady&#8221;</a> aspersions in her endorsement. And that seems to have inspired Musk&#8217;s cat comment.</p>



<p>As for the part about giving the pop icon &#8220;a baby&#8221; &#8212; well, the reasoning behind that remark is less clear and far more controversial.</p>



<p>In her <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13857639/Hillary-Clinton-accuses-Elon-Musk-threatening-rape-Taylor-Swift.html?ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490&amp;ito=social-twitter_dailymailus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Swisher</a>, Clinton alleged that Musk&#8217;s offer to &#8220;impregnate&#8221; Swift was &#8220;kind of another way of saying rape.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hillary-clinton-goes-off-on-elon-musk">Hillary Clinton Goes Off on Elon Musk</h2>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why he says what he says. It just is beyond my imagination,&#8221; Clinton said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s Trump or Musk or any other so-called masters of the universe in the technology world, misogyny is such a part of their worldview, and they gravitate toward toughness and brutality and machoism.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hillary went on to draw an unflattering comparison between Taylor&#8217;s career and Musk&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Taylor Swift, a self-made billionaire who brings joy to people who imparts life lessons, particularly to girls and women. They can&#8217;t stand it,&#8221; Clinton said.</p>



<p> Clinton went on to suggest that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-says-taylor-swift-will-pay-a-price-for-kamala-harris-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Taylor&#8217;s endorsement of Harris</a> had &#8220;triggered&#8221; Trump and his supporters.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, if it had happened before the debate, it would&#8217;ve overpowered the debate,&#8221; she noted.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="791" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-791x1024.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift attends the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards at UBS Arena on September 11, 2024 in Elmont, New York." class="wp-image-509462" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-232x300.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-768x995.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-1581x2048.jpg 1581w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-741x960.jpg 741w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-834x1080.jpg 834w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-926x1200.jpg 926w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2171410935-scaled.jpg 1976w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards at UBS Arena on September 11, 2024 in Elmont, New York.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;The fact that it happened right after the debate and just added to Kamala&#8217;s momentum must have just set them all off,&#8221; Clinton added.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-string-of-controversies">A String of Controversies</h2>



<p>Clinton&#8217;s allegations come on the heels of a separate controversy. Earlier this week, Musk tweeted and deleted a remark about Harris that he later dismissed as a joke.</p>



<p>In the wake of Sunday&#8217;s assassination attempt against Donald Trump, Musk tweeted:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2151277355-1024x683.jpg" alt="Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X Holdings Corp., speaks at the Milken Institute's Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel,on May 6, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;No one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.&#8221;</p>



<p>For obvious reasons, the tweet did not go over well. In fact, the hashtag &#8220;#DeportElon&#8221; trended as a result of Musk&#8217;s remark.</p>



<p>He later deleted the tweet and explained that it was an attempt at humor:</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, one lesson I&#8217;ve learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s going to be all that hilarious as a post on X,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s tough to imagine how the current election cycle could get any more absurd. But we get the feeling that the next six weeks will take this country to places we never imagined.</p>

<p>Megan Fox has never been one to shy away from a conflict.</p>



<p>And it seems she won&#8217;t back down even when her rival is one of the wealthiest men on the planet.</p>



<p>Last week, conservative provocateur Robby Starbuck alleged that Megan forces her sons to wear clothing designed for girls.</p>



<p>The former congressional candidate claimed that he once saw two of the boys suffer a &#8220;full on breakdown&#8221; because of their mother&#8217;s insistence that they reject gender norms.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox selfie alert! The actress shared this photo on her Instagram page.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This unexpected spat between a famous actress and a Z-list nobody became one of the day&#8217;s top stories on Twitter, eventually capturing the attention of the rocket man himself, Elon Musk.</p>



<p>It all started when Starbuck tweeted the photo below along with the allegation about Megan&#8217;s fashion rules.</p>



<p>&#8220;These are Megan Fox’s sons. We used to live in the same gated community and our kids played at the park,&#8221; he wrote.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox has been accused of forcing her sons to wear clothing designed for girls.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I saw 2 of them have a full on breakdown saying they were forced by their mom to wear girls clothes as their nanny tried to console them. It’s pure child abuse. Pray for them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Megan took to Instagram to respond the the bizarre allegation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to give you this attention because clearly youre a clout chaser,&#8221; she wrote alongside a screenshot of Starbuck&#8217;s tweet.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Megan Fox works the red carpet in this pic from May of 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p> </p>



<p>&#8220;But let me teach you something…irregardless of how desperate you may become at any given time to acquire wealth, power, success, or fame—never use children as leverage or social currency, especially under malevolent and erroneous pretense,&#8221; Megan continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Exploiting my child’s gender identity to gain attention in your political campaign has put you on the wrong side of the universe</p>



<p>Megan went on to blast Starbuck as &#8220;insecure, narcissistic,&#8221; and &#8220;impotent,&#8221; noting that she&#8217;s dealt with &#8220;little men like you many times&#8221; and always come out on top.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;You f-cked with the wrong witch,&#8221; she concluded.</p>



<p>Elon watched watched these interactions closely from the start, replying to Starbuck&#8217;s initial tweet with an exclamation point. </p>



<p>On Sunday, Musk tweeted that he was &#8220;Looking to hire a VP of Witchcraft &amp; Propaganda,&#8221; a clear reference to Megan&#8217;s witch remarks.</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly at the premiere of his documentary. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why the Tesla CEO felt the need to get involved, but it&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/elon-musks-daughter-comes-out-as-trans-cuts-ties-with-transphobic-father/">Musk has a trans daughter </a>who cut ties with him due to his alleged transphobia.</p>



<p>As for Megan, she appears to be <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/megan-fox-machine-gun-kelly-didnt-cheat-on-me-but-i-still-might-dump-him/">back together with Machine Gun Kelly</a> these days, but he has yet to speak out on this matter.</p>



<p>However, Megan&#8217;s baby daddy Brian Austin Green came to her defense and blasted the allegations as ridiculous.</p>

<p>So there you have it.</p>



<p>If, for some reason, you were deeply concerned about what sort of clothing Megan Fox&#8217;s kids wear, it seems that you can breathe easy.</p>



<p>Of course, we&#8217;re sure Robby Starbuck is still all worked up over this situation because he&#8217;s an odd, odd man.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kanye-west-praises-hitler-actually-says-out-loud-nazis-arent-so-bad/">Kanye West exposed himself as a full-blown Nazi</a> this week.</p>



<p>And it turns out that publicly praising Hitler isn&#8217;t the smartest career move.</p>



<p>In fact, Kanye&#8217;s latest act of insanity has forced even longtime supporter Elon Musk to distance himself from the rapper.</p>



<p>Yes, Musk confirmed on Thursday that West has been suspended from Twitter after posting a bizarre graphic that combined a swastika with a Star of David.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Ye first tested the waters by posting a photo of Musk getting hosed down by famed talent agent Ari Emanuel.</p>



<p>Musk commented, &#8220;That is fine&#8221; on the photo, but replied, &#8220;This is not&#8221; to the swastika image.</p>



<p>When a user asked Musk to &#8220;FIX KANYE PLEASE,&#8221; the Twitter owner replied, &#8220;I tried my best. Despite that, he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461441" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242720124-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Elon Musk can now add &#8220;owner of Twitter&#8221; to his long list of titles.

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Just clarifying that his account is being suspended for incitement to violence, not an unflattering pic of me being hosed by Ari,&#8221; he wrote to a different user.</p>



<p>&#8220;Frankly, I found those pics to be helpful motivation to lose weight!&#8221;</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;ve been enjoying watching Kanye&#8217;s career go down in flames, fear not:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="890" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1024x890.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461559" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1024x890.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-300x261.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-768x668.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1536x1336.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-2048x1781.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-735x639.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-335x291.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-347x302.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-520x452.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-640x556.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-960x835.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429638282-1080x939.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Kanye West attends the Balenciaga Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on October 2, 2022 in Villepinte, France.

<p></p>



<p>West migrated over to the Donald Trump-owned Truth Social platform, where he shared a screenshot indicating that  his Twitter suspension would only be in place for 12 hours.</p>



<p>Musk is a self-avowed champion of &#8220;free speech,&#8221; but to his credit, it seems he draws the line at hateful rhetoric that has the potential to get someone killed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every human being has something of value that they brought to the table, especially Hitler,&#8221; West said during his appearance on Alex Jones&#8217; InfoWars yesterday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Kanye West both looked and sounded completely insane during his recent Alex Jones interview. The rapper has now been suspended from Twitter. (Photo via InfoWars)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The baffling comment shocked even the notoriously incendiary Jones &#8212; but Kanye was just getting warmed up. </p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis,&#8221; the rapper continued.</p>



<p>When Jones pointed out that the Nazis were, in fact, quite bad, West interjected:</p>

Now, the rapper is allegedly on the brink of bankruptcy. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;They did good things too; we are gonna stop dissing the Nazis.&#8221; </p>



<p>Before Jones could intercede and go to to commercial, West blurted, &#8220;I like Hitler,&#8221;</p>



<p>West had previously been in talks to buy the social media site Parler, but following the Jones interview, the company took to Twitter to announce that they had &#8220;mutually agreed with Ye to terminate the intent of sale of Parler.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Kanye West gave another bizarre interview this week. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parler, of course, is just one of several companies who have cut ties with Kanye in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Thanks to the termination of his lucrative Adidas deal, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kanye-west-i-owe-50-million-in-taxes-the-irs-is-gonna-throw-me-in-jail/">West is no longer a billionaire</a>, and insiders say that the rapper&#8217;s wildly expensive lifestyle could bring him on the verge of bankruptcy in a matter of months.</p>



<p>We wonder who West will blame when his money dries up?</p>

<p>In all likelihood, Amber Heard will write a memoir some day.</p>



<p>And hopefully, the book will turn out to be an indispensable guide for women who are struggling with the influence of toxic bros in their lives.</p>



<p>Over the summer <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/johnny-depps-erectile-dysfunction-led-to-sexual-assault-amber-heard-claims/">Heard&#8217;s trial against ex-husband Johnny Depp </a>made headlines in both the tabloids and the mainstream press.</p>



<p>And now, another controversial ex of Amber&#8217;s is making news for a very different reason.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, Tesla CEO <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/elon-musk-completes-purchase-of-twitter-immediately-fires-rivals-within-company/">Elon Musk completed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter</a> this week.</p>



<p>Heard and Musk dated for several months beginning in 2016, and it&#8217;s been widely rumored that Musk is the father of Heard&#8217;s child.</p>



<p>(We should note that there&#8217;s no solid evidence to support those rumors, and the speculation seems to result from the fact that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/elon-musk-welcomed-secret-twins-last-year-everyone-should-have-10-kids-billionaire-proclaims/"> Musk has many kids</a> by many different women.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="657" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1024x657.jpg" alt="Amber Heard Leaves Court" class="wp-image-449315" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-768x492.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-2048x1313.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-735x471.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-335x215.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-347x222.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-520x333.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-640x410.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-960x616.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/amber-heard-leaves-court-1080x693.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Amber Heard at the courthouse during her legal battle against Johnny Depp. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Heard has yet to comment on her ex&#8217;s high-profile acquisition, but she may have spoken volumes without saying word:</p>



<p>As <em>People</em> magazine <a href="https://people.com/movies/amber-heard-twitter-account-gone-after-elon-musk-ceo/">reports</a>, fans were quick to notice that Heard&#8217;s Twitter account has vanished without a trace.</p>



<p>The likeliest explanation is that she deleted her page in response to this week&#8217;s news, but some observers prefer the more scandalous narrative, speculating that Musk had Heard&#8217;s account deleted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461443" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-735x489.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-520x346.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-640x426.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242798529-1080x719.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Elon Musk has completed his takeover of Twitter.

<p></p>



<p>The timeline of Amber and Elon&#8217;s relationship is unclear, but Heard insisted in court that she did not start dating the Tesla CEO until after she had separated from Depp.</p>



<p>A source tells <em>People</em> that Musk and Heard &#8220;didn&#8217;t start seeing each other until May 2016, and even then it was infrequent. Their relationship didn&#8217;t become romantic until some time later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Elon and I had a beautiful relationship, and we have a beautiful friendship now, one that was based on our core values,&#8221; Amber said in a statement issued after their split.</p>

<p>&#8220;Intellectual curiosity, ideas and conversation, a shared love for science. We just bonded on a lot of things that speak to who I am on the inside. I have so much respect for him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Musk mostly kept silent during the Depp v Heard trial, but he did share his thoughts toward the end of the case, tweeting:</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope they both move on. At their best, they are each incredible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heard&#8217;s relationship with Musk was a frequent topic of discussion during her legal battle against Depp, with post-breakup texts from Amber being introduced into evidence.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hate that yet again a man let&#8217;s me fall on the spikes by myself. … Meaning, they are mad at me for leaving them and put things like this out there,&#8221; the actress wrote to her agent, Christian Carino.</p>



<p>&#8220;You could avoid all this if you stopped dating über-famous people. You can be with a big man who isn&#8217;t famous,&#8221; Carino replied.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Well, there&#8217;s no guarantee that Heard&#8217;s next boyfriend won&#8217;t act like a jerk, even if he isn&#8217;t famous.</p>



<p>But yes, if she dates some dude who works at Subway, she probably doesn&#8217;t have to worry about him eventually buying one of her favorite social media platforms.</p>



<p>Of course, a discount on five-dollar footlongs probably isn&#8217;t quite as exciting as promises of a free trip to Mars.</p>

<p>Elon Musk may not deliver on all of his promises &#8212; in fact, his network of traffic jam-obliterating tunnels beneath the streets of LA currently seems about as far-fetched as his dream of colonizing Mars.</p>



<p>But when the man vows to take revenge against those who he feels have wronged him, his plans come to fruition more often than not.</p>



<p>Case in point, after months of legal wrangling and very public drama,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-its-actually-happening-possibly-today/"> Musk completed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter </a>this week.</p>



<p>And like a guillotine-happy monarch, his first order of business was to do away with those who stood in the way of his ascension.</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter/index.html">new report</a> from CNN, Musk completed his takeover of the social media platform on Thursday night, and his first official act was to fire three of the site&#8217;s top execs.</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Musk has terminated Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, along with Twitter&#8217;s head of legal policy, trust, and safety Vijaya Gadde, and CFO Ned Segal.</p>



<p>Insiders say that Musk also fired Twitter&#8217;s top lawyer Sean Edgett, who, like the others, was led away from the company&#8217;s campus via shuttle after receiving news that he had been let go.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Obviously, all of the dismissals send a powerful message about the regime change that&#8217;s currently taking place within one of the world&#8217;s top media brands.</p>



<p>But the firing of Gadde might be the clearest indication of things to come.</p>



<p>As the person most responsible for enforcement of the site&#8217;s terms of service, it was Gadde who made the decision to ban then-president Donald Trump from Twitter.</p>

<p>Musk has hinted several times that he plans to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/elon-musk-makes-it-official-donald-trump-is-welcome-back-on-twit/">allow Trump to return to the site</a>, and the firing of Gadde seems to be his first step toward making good on that promise.</p>



<p>It might also be an indication that Musk intends to loosen the restrictions regarding the sort of content that users are allowed to tweet.</p>



<p>The 51-year-old billionaire has yet to issue an official statement regarding the purchase, but in his typically irreverent, self-consciously corny style, he tweeted the photo below, along with a caption reading:</p>

<p>“Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!”</p>



<p>Musk also changed his bio on the site to read &#8220;Chief Twit,&#8221; another apparent reference to his takeover.</p>



<p>Late last night, the Tesla CEO tweeted, &#8220;the bird is freed,&#8221; and this morning he followed it up with a post reading simply, &#8220;let the good times roll.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Interestingly, Musk used the &#8220;spoiler alert&#8221; tag for that tweet, which has been taken as a hint that an official announcement will be made later today.</p>



<p>The acquisition comes after months of legal wrangling, including Musk&#8217;s July announcement that he would be pulling out of the deal, a move that triggered a lawsuit from Twitter.</p>



<p>The company alleged that Musk&#8217;s public statements on the purchase compelled him to follow through with it.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Insiders tell <em>People</em> that Musk decided to seal the deal after his legal team indicated that he would lose if the case went to trial.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Elon is putting the &#8220;hostile&#8221; back in hostile takeover.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s likely that more heads will roll before the day is done.</p>

<p>Elon Musk might have hit the birth canal lottery when he was born into a fabulously wealthy emerald mining family in South Africa.</p>



<p>But with three divorces and 10 kids (that we know of) by three baby mamas, Musk has been incredibly unlucky in love.</p>



<p>Musk is a master of multi-tasking, which enables him to go through multiple breakups in less time than it takes normal people to start a single serious relationship.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/grimes-welcomes-second-child-dumps-elon-musk-starts-dating-chels/">Musk got dumped by Grimes</a> for the second time back in March, and he&#8217;s already enduring another messy breakup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="693" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-1024x693.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-450320" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-1024x693.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-768x519.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-1536x1039.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-2048x1385.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-735x497.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-335x227.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-347x235.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-520x352.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-640x433.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-960x649.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1240422158-1080x730.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Elon Musk arrives for the 2022 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

<p></p>



<p>At this point, we&#8217;re starting to think the guy wants to move to another planet just so he can meet a woman who hasn&#8217;t already dumped him.</p>



<p>Anyway, if you were on Twitter at all this week, you might have seen pics of a shirtless Musk partying on a yacht in Mykonos, Greece.</p>



<p>It seems that Elon was trying to get over yet another breakup, having recently been dumped by 27-year-old actress Natasha Bassett.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-453191" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-735x489.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-520x346.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-640x426.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1399259397-1080x719.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Natasha Bassett attends an &#8220;Elvis&#8221; after party during the 75th annual Cannes film festival in May.

<p>Like so several of Musk&#8217;s exes, Natasha is an actress who&#8217;s much, much younger than him.</p>



<p>In order to ensure the optimal power imbalance, Elon usually selects aspiring starlets who have not yet hit it big.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for him, Natasha is enjoying a great deal of sudden popularity and acclaim thanks to her performance in Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s Elvis biopic.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Insiders say Natasha ended her relationship with Elon in order to focus on her acting career.</p>



<p>And it seems that Musk is not taking the breakup well.</p>



<p>In fact, according to a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/07/19/elon-musk-pleading-natasha-bassett-getting-back-together/">new report</a> from <em>Hollywood Life</em>, the SpaceX founder has been &#8220;pleading&#8221; with Bassett to take him back.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-682x1024.jpg" alt="Elon Musk" class="wp-image-273902" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/elon-musk-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Elon Musk attends a post-Oscar Party.

<p></p>



<p>“Elon was pleading with Natasha to get back together with him prior to taking off on this trip to Mykonos, but she kept shutting him down,&#8221; one insider tells the outlet.</p>



<p>Now, we don&#8217;t usually see candid photos of Musk enjoying his downtime.</p>



<p>The source suspects that Elon allowed himself to be papped while partying in Greece in the hope that the pics would make Natasha jealous.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-1024x683.jpg" alt="Elon Musk In a Cowboy Hat" class="wp-image-416440" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/elon-musk-in-a-cowboy-hat.jpg 1602w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Elon Musk clearly considers himself the world&#8217;s funniest billionaire. Unfortunately for Elon, the world doesn&#8217;t find him all that funny. (Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Natasha and those around her believe that Elon was trying to make her jealous by being photographed with all of these gorgeous women,” the insider says. </p>



<p>“But this did not make Natasha jealous,&#8221; the source continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;This type of behavior is one of the reasons that Natasha decided to end the relationship, and all this does is reassure her that she made the right choice.”</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Yes, like his network of underground tunnels that was supposed to eliminate traffic in LA, it seems that Musk&#8217;s plan to make his ex jealous was a total bust.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the guy&#8217;s got plenty of distractions in his life.</p>



<p>In addition to the many companies he runs, Musk is a freakin&#8217; father of 10 (again, that we know of)!</p>



<p>Maybe next time a 20-something actress dumps him, dude should spend some time with his kids instead of hatching a diabolical plot to win her back.</p>

<p>There are few public figures more divisive than Elon Musk.</p>



<p>And the Tesla CEO probably wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>



<p>Musk has an army of devoted fanboys who defend his every move, but he&#8217;s also attracted a good deal of criticism for insensitive remarks that he obviously thinks of as harmless trolling.</p>



<p>Some of the most controversial of these remarks have had to do with Musk&#8217;s views on gender identity.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Although tweets such as &#8220;pronouns suck&#8221; seem to indicate that the billionaire has given very little thought to the matter at all.</p>



<p>So perhaps it should come as no surprise that Musk&#8217;s trans daughter has decided that she wants nothing to do with him.</p>



<p>Eighteen-year-old Vivian Jenna Wilson submitted a petition for a change of name this week.</p>



<p></p>

<p>On the application, she cited the following reasons for the desired change as follows:</p>



<p>“Gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vivian is one of Musk&#8217;s eight children.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>It&#8217;s been rumored that the billionaire is also father to actress Amber Heard&#8217;s daughter, but neither party has confirmed those reports.</p>



<p>Little is known about Musk&#8217;s first marriage to Justine Wilson, who is mother to Vivian.</p>



<p>The teen has taken her mother&#8217;s last name, seemingly in order to further distance herself from her father.</p>

<p>After he and Wilson parted ways, Musk married actress Talulah Riley.</p>



<p>The couple divorced two years later, in 2012, before remarrying in 2013, and divorcing for the final time a year later.</p>



<p>Musk has two children with singer Grimes, whom he dated from 2018 to 2022.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Grimes once publicly rebuked Musk&#8217;s transphobic sentiments.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you but please turn off ur phone or give me a [call]. I cannot support hate,&#8221; she wrote following his 2020 tweet about pronouns.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please stop this. I know this isn&#8217;t your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few months later, Musk doubled down on the sentiment with a meme (below) mocking the concept of putting preferred pronouns in one&#8217;s social media bio</p>



<p>&#8220;I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare,&#8221; Musk later clarified.</p>



<p>Grimes is now <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/grimes-welcomes-second-child-dumps-elon-musk-starts-dating-chels/">dating trans activist Chelsea Manning</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Musk has lashed out at critics who have accused him of transphobia, pointing out that the Human Rights Campaign ranked Tesla as one of the best places for LGBTQ+ people to work.</p>



<p>However, when the same organization called for Musk to apologize for his pronoun comments, he refused.</p>



<p>“Elon Musk’s tweet mocking pronouns is exactly the opposite of what inclusive leadership looks like today,&#8221; HRC leadership tweeted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s also decidedly out of step with the best practices we advise companies. Musk should apologize.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-its-actually-happening-possibly-today/">Musk is currently in talks to buy Twitter</a>, and many opponents of the move believe that his outdated stances on important social issues make the 50-year-old a poor candidate for such an important role.</p>



<p>Whatever happens, it appears that Musk&#8217;s activity on the social media platform has already had a negative impact on his relationship with his daughter.</p>

<p>The guy could&#8217;ve enjoyed his massive fortune and played up his role as the ultimate God Among Geeks without ever telling anyone who he voted for or weighing in on the day&#8217;s headlines.</p>
<p>He could&#8217;ve kept buying patents from inventors and fashioning an image for himself as the mad scientist/savior who&#8217;s gonna save mankind by colonizing the entire solar system.</p>
<p>Instead, Musk made the decision to rebrand himself as social media&#8217;s number one culture warrior, and not surprisingly, his life and public image have become far more complicated as a result.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, <a href="/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-its-actually-happening-possibly-today/">Musk plans to buy Twitter</a>, which is not in itself a political act.</p>
<p>But like everything in his life these days, Musk has <em>made</em> it political by trolling his opponents and bashing those whose views don&#8217;t align with his own.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this has made him a target and led to increased scrutiny of his private life.</p>

<p>Last week, Musk was accused of exposing himself to a flight attendant on his private jet and offering to buy the woman a horse in exchange for sex.</p>
<p>He tried to get in front of the story by tweeting that he expected to become the center of a smear campaign in the very near future.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold,&quot; Musk tweeted.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>(Insiders say the Tesla CEO was already aware of the forthcoming horse story when he &quot;predicted&quot; the attacks.)</p>
<p>Musk went on to alleged that he&#8217;s on the receiving end of a &quot;relentless hatestream from the far left&quot; which might explain why he launched a seemingly random attack against Hillary Clinton over the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be interested to know if, when you receive control over the company, anything was done with this at any level. Pls advise soonest,&quot; a small, anonymous account wrote, tagging Musk in the tweet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The tweet the account referred to was posted by Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Computer scientists have apparently uncovered a covert server linking the Trump Organization to a Russian-based bank,&quot; Hillary wrote at the time.</p>
<p>Attached to the tweet was a statement from Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, which claimed that Trump Tower was equipped with a &quot;secret server&quot; that may be the &quot;key to unlocking the mystery of Trump&#8217;s ties to Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This line of communication may help explain Trump&#8217;s bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many pro-Kremlin positions throughout his campaign,&quot; the statement continued.</p>
<p>A 5-year-old allegation from an anonymous account would probably go unnoticed by Musk in most situations, but on this day, Elon was spoiling for some controversy.</p>
<p>&quot;You are absolutely correct. That tweet is a Clinton campaign hoax for which their campaign lawyer is undergoing a criminal trial,&quot; he replied.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Musk linked to an article about the trial of&nbsp;campaign lawyer, the aptly-named Michael Sussman, who has been accused to lying to the FBI about Trump&#8217;s relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Musk&#8217;s allegation that Clinton committed campaign fraud has been met with considerable blowback, with some pointing out factual inaccuracies in his argument, and others accusing the billionaire of attempting to deflect attention away from his sex scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;Elon Musk is now spreading treasonous lies about Hillary Clinton &mdash; and claiming the Trump-Russia collusion was a &#8216;hoax,&#8217;&rdquo; tweeted Democratic strategist Dash Dobrofsky.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Elon is also kissing up to Jim Jordan &mdash; an guy who allowed 43 kids at OSU to be molested. I&rsquo;ll never buy a Tesla. For as long as I live. Neither should you.&quot;</p>
<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s getting ugly out there, just as everyone predicted it would when Musk announced his plans to buy Twitter.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems that Musk is just about the only one who&#8217;s surprised by all of this.</p>

<p>To be clear, despite the many headlines declaring that the deal is done, Musk does <em>not</em> yet control Twitter, and he could still pull out of the deal.</p>
<p>The backlash he&#8217;s experienced in the past few days might have left him more inclined to pull the plug.</p>
<p>Or maybe he&#8217;ll go the opposite route &#8212; push the deal through so that he can create further distraction by <a href="/2022/05/elon-musk-makes-it-official-donald-trump-is-welcome-back-on-twit/">restoring Donald Trump&#8217;s account</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, you can be sure this situation will become even more bonkers in the days and weeks to come!</p>
