<p>Sabrina Carpenter is putting on a show in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>



<p>The at times <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/sabrina-carpenter-brit-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>scandalous </em>singer</a> has a reputation for salacious poses on stage.</p>



<p>Now that the beloved short queen singer has become a Fortnite Festival game icon alongside numerous other pop culture figures, fans are taking it to a whole new level.</p>



<p>As you can see in a few examples below, players are having a blast, having Sabrina do spicy theatrics.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="746" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-746x1024.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on stage on March 1, 2025." class="wp-image-523089" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-746x1024.jpg 746w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-219x300.jpg 219w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-768x1054.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-1492x2048.jpg 1492w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-699x960.jpg 699w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-787x1080.jpg 787w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-874x1200.jpg 874w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_sabrinacarpenter_01-scaled.jpg 1865w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter performs on stage during The BRIT Awards 2025 at The O2 Arena on March 01, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sabrina-carpenter-has-joined-fortnite">Sabrina Carpenter has joined Fortnite</h2>



<p>Most video games have stories, characters, and settings &#8212; adapted from source material or invented for the games themselves.</p>



<p><em>Fortnite</em>, which is traditionally a battle royale type game but also has other modes, tends to borrow (legally, of course) other established properties &#8212; from public figures to films to other video games.</p>



<p>On the surface, the idea is simply that the predominantly younger player base simply dukes it out while chatting with friends. </p>



<p>However, the various game modes and the innate nature of human creativity means that people can have real fun with it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Fortnite x Sabrina Carpenter - Wish You Were Here" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNb_q0-zIYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>So naturally, with the announcement of a playable likeness of Sabrina Carpenter becoming a <em>Fortnite </em>character alongside the likes of Deadpool, Kratos, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/how-did-travis-scott-get-his-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Scott</a>, fans were excited.</p>



<p>Some because they are huge fans of the singer. Some because they&#8217;re thirsty for her. And there&#8217;s a <em>lot </em>of overlap between those two groups.</p>



<p>With that in mind, is it any surprise to see this digital rendering of Carpenter seeming to give lap dances, &#8220;ride,&#8221; and more &#8212; often with other players who have taken on the guise of the singer?</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">they never should&#39;ve added sabrina to fortnite LMFAOOO😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/pwlvmBV2k5">pic.twitter.com/pwlvmBV2k5</a></p>&mdash; 𝗱𝗮𝗻𝗻𝘆🫧💚 (@beyoncegarden) <a href="https://twitter.com/beyoncegarden/status/1909763304072892910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genuinely-it-s-wonderful-to-see-human-creativity-on-display">Genuinely, it&#8217;s wonderful to see human creativity on display</h2>



<p>In the world of flesh, Sabrina Carpenter says &#8220;Have you ever tried this one?&#8221; on stage before striking a pose &#8212; often a suggestive one.</p>



<p>(Anyone else remember the recent <em>pearl-clutching</em> when Sabrina pretended to be in the midst of a fully clothed spitroast? That was only last month)</p>



<p>Well, now fans are using that same catchphrase &#8212; which, yes, is a <em>voiceline </em>in the game &#8212; before trying to coordinate the spiciest attempts at raunchiness that a Rated T for Teen game can offer.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Freaking position !!!! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ParisShortnSweet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ParisShortnSweet</a> <a href="https://t.co/Z6seTTBhX1">pic.twitter.com/Z6seTTBhX1</a></p>&mdash; Marie 🫶 (@callmemariepal) <a href="https://twitter.com/callmemariepal/status/1901736593183940791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>If you have ever played any kind of multiplayer game in the past couple of decades, none of this is likely a surprise to you.</p>



<p>Most video games in recent years have had a sudden and dramatic reduction in sexual or even overly suggestive content. (See also, the movie industry, where sex scenes are few and far between)</p>



<p>Some of this is our deeply conservative and sex-negative culture rearing its ugly head. </p>



<p>Some of it is businessman brainrot &#8212; seeking to maximize sales by expanding the audience to teens who won&#8217;t need a parent to sign off. It&#8217;s bleak, but gamers make do.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-the-singer-herself-mind-this">Does the singer herself mind this?</h2>



<p>Anyone who grew up making Barbies (or X-Men, or Transformers, or whatever) kiss cannot be surprised at this. Of <em>course </em>similar antics play out in battle royale games that people usually play with friends.</p>



<p>And Sabrina Carpenter herself has flirty, suggestive dances as part of her real-life performances.</p>



<p>We cannot claim to know the inner workings at Epic Games. <em>But </em>we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if she received notice of all of the emotes when she made this deal. </p>



<p>Anyone who isn&#8217;t comfortable with some creatively posed emotes of themselves really should not want to be in video games. Especially since there are plenty with more spicy potential than <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter seems to have shaded Barry Keoghan in his hometown.</p>



<p>The pop star and the actor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/sabrina-carpenter-and-barry-keoghan-call-it-quits-after-one-year-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called it quits</a> in late 2024 following about a year of dating.</p>



<p>Sabrina&#8217;s love life has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/camila-cabello-love-triangle-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed her music</a> before. But sometimes, she doesn&#8217;t need a song to make a point.</p>



<p>While performing in Barry&#8217;s hometown, she appeared to take a swipe at her ex.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-sabrina-carpenter-just-shade-barry-keoghan-in-his-hometown">Did Sabrina Carpenter just shade Barry Keoghan in his hometown?</h2>



<p>Over the weekend, Sabrina Carpenter visited the UK. Saturday, of course, was her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/sabrina-carpenter-brit-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;racy&#8221; performance at the BRIT Awards</a>.</p>



<p>On Monday, March 3, she performed before a delighted audience in Dublin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dublin, it&#8217;s so lovely to be here,&#8221; she told the crowd of predominantly Irish fans, according to <em><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/sabrina-carpenter-slams-ex-barry-34792749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a></em>. &#8220;You all look and sound amazing.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Barry Keoghan and a plunging neckline on November 17, 2024." class="wp-image-520681" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0305_barrykeoghan_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Barry Keoghan attends the 2024 Governors Awards at Dolby Theatre on November 17, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, while addressing the crowd in Dublin, Sabrina Carpenter appeared to make a thinly veiled jab at Barry Keoghan.</p>



<p>“But my goodness, these Irish boys are hard work,” she teased the crowd.</p>



<p>Much of her audience could likely relate. But given that Barry Keoghan is from Summerhill, Dublin, many assume that Sabrina Carpenter was speaking from personal experience as she addressed fans in her ex&#8217;s hometown.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-even-sabrina-carpenter-s-song-choice-may-have-been-a-jab-at-barry-keoghan">Even Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s song choice may have been a jab at Barry Keoghan</h2>



<p>One of the songs that Sabrina performed in Dublin was one of her biggest hits (and my personal favorite of her discography), &#8220;Please Please Please.&#8221;</p>



<p>As you can see below, Barry Keoghan starred in Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s music video for the song.</p>



<p>Additionally, there is a rumor that the song is also about him. (Which is pretty rare &#8212; imagine if Harry Styles starred in a music video for Taylor Swift&#8217;s &#8220;Style&#8221; or &#8220;Out Of The Woods&#8221;)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sabrina Carpenter - Please Please Please (Official Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cF1Na4AIecM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;Please Please Please&#8221; is from the point of view of someone whose partner is a total embarrassment to the singer.</p>



<p>One of the lines is: &#8220;Whatever devil&#8217;s inside you, don&#8217;t let him out tonight.&#8221; She also sings about friends rolling their eyes when she tries to excuse his antics.</p>



<p>Obviously, millions of people can relate. Even if you&#8217;ve never had a partner whose behavior or general vibes had your friends urging you to break up, you probably know someone who has. Perhaps you&#8217;ve even been the friend urging them to break up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-split-came-late-last-year">The split came late last year</h2>



<p>And, in the case of Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan, they very much did break up. The two split in December of 2024, after about one year of dating.</p>



<p>All sorts of rumors circulated after things ended. Though Sabrina has never made this claim, some whispered that Barry had cheated.</p>



<p>With so many of Sabrina&#8217;s fans being young women, Barry received an avalanche of troll comments and harassment on social media following the breakup. There are downsides to dating an international pop superstar &#8230; especially when you become exes.</p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter has ruffled some British feathers with a <em>very </em>Sabrina Carpenter performance.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, the still somewhat <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/sabrina-carpenter-and-barry-keoghan-call-it-quits-after-one-year-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly single singer</a> hopped across the pond to perform at the BRIT Awards.</p>



<p>She performed a mash-up of &#8220;Espresso&#8221; and &#8220;Bed Chem,&#8221; interspersed with some rousing British instrumentals.</p>



<p>So what&#8217;s the problem? Apparently, this performance was simply too <em>steamy </em>for some of the tea-drinking audience. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-1024x695.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on March 1, 2025." class="wp-image-520655" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-1080x733.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_01-1200x815.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter performs on stage during The BRIT Awards 2025 at The O2 Arena on March 01, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-the-brits-so-steamed-about-sabrina-carpenter">What has the Brits so steamed about Sabrina Carpenter?</h2>



<p>Some folks prefer their shows a little tepid. By some standards, Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s needed more time to cool. (Is that a tea joke or an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-meaning-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Espresso&#8221;</a> pun? You decide)</p>



<p>On Saturday, March 1, Sabrina delighted the live audience with her performance of the mash-up. </p>



<p>On stage, Sabrina wore a sparkling jacket &#8212; one that she paired with dancers dressed as royal guards &#8212; over some very thorough red lingerie. Her backup dancers were split between the guardsmen and the lingerie-clad synchronized dancers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This delightful performance was exactly what anyone familiar with Sabrina Carpenter might expect. However, not everyone has the &#8220;Taste&#8221; (Get it? She has a song with that title) to be familiar with her work.</p>



<p>Furious British viewers took to the tattered remains of what was once Twitter to howl and wail over the &#8220;pure soft porn&#8221; that they had witnessed. (If that&#8217;s soft porn, what is their actual porn like? Mouth-kissing?)</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s cool to be sexy and empowered. Unfortunately, this throw back was none of those things. Cheap and tacky,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/AnneStockton01/status/1896009102721237130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spat</a> one disgruntled viewer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sabrina-carpenter-learned-what-watershed-means">Sabrina Carpenter learned what &#8216;watershed&#8217; means</h2>



<p>When it comes to British television, &#8220;watershed&#8221; is the cutoff point at which the BBC may air television that might be unsuitable for children. Usually, this time is around 9 PM.</p>



<p>Another social media user <a href="https://x.com/PaulKirkby3/status/1896211991414599980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>: &#8220;Some people threatening to complain to Ofcom about Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s BRIT Awards performance need to get a life.&#8221;</p>



<p>The presumably British fan continued: &#8220;It was a fun show with great energy! If you can&#8217;t handle a little excitement before 9 pm, maybe it&#8217;s time to lighten up!&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso/Bed Chem (Live at The BRIT Awards 2025)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mtJvsfAtF0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Sabrina Carpenter herself shared photos from the BRIT Awards and a somewhat cheeky caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;I now know what watershed is!!!!&#8221; she wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGtGcLyPJM3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, when a lot of enraged people from beans-on-toast island start posting your name and &#8220;watershed,&#8221; you&#8217;re going to look up what it means.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-698x1024.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter dances at the Brit Awards on March 1, 2025." class="wp-image-520657" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-205x300.jpg 205w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-1396x2048.jpg 1396w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-654x960.jpg 654w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-736x1080.jpg 736w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-818x1200.jpg 818w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-scaled.jpg 1745w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter performs on stage during The BRIT Awards 2025 at The O2 Arena on March 01, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-a-familiar-experience-for-her">This is a familiar experience for her</h2>



<p>For years, some truly bizarre people have targeted Sabrina Carpenter with outrage over her performances. </p>



<p>Her wardrobe is actually not that different from many other singers, and her dancing is far from the most erotic.</p>



<p>It is possible that some of her detractors are infantalizing Sabrina because she is 5 feet tall, even though she&#8217;s a grown woman. But let&#8217;s be honest: when have weirdos <em>ever </em>needed an excuse to condemn a woman for showing a hint of sexuality?</p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter has been stuck in all of our heads this year! With tons of hit songs dropping since spring, she&#8217;s been inescapable!</p>



<p>Sabrina has dominated the airwaves with tunes like &#8220;Espresso&#8221; and &#8220;Please Please Please.&#8221; Plus, her <em>Short N&#8217; Sweet </em>tour was one of the hottest tickets of the summer. </p>

<p>With so many projects under her belt, it should be no surprise that Sabrina has earned $12 million throughout her career. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-sabrina-carpenter-make-her-money">How Did Sabrina Carpenter Make Her Money?</h2>



<p>While many people may have just learned about Sabrina Carpenter this year with hits like &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-meaning-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Espresso</a>,&#8221; she&#8217;s been working hard for a very long time.</p>



<p>Before she was singing, Sabrina was an actress, and she got her first role in 2011. She was a guest on <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</em>. From there, Sabrina went on to other major roles, most notably in a reboot of a classic sitcom.</p>

<p>In 2013, Sabrina was cast on <em>Girl Meets World</em> as Maya Hart, the main character Riley&#8217;s BFF. The role definitely helped introduce the future popstar to both a generation of fans watching Disney Channel, but also millenials who were excited for the <em>Boy Meets World </em>reboot.</p>



<p>While Sabrina was also an actress on Disney Channel, she began her music career by recording songs for Disney programs. Her debut EP <em>Can&#8217;t Blame a Girl for Trying </em>was released in 2014 and album <em>Eyes Wide Open </em>in 2015.</p>



<p>While continuing her time on Disney and other acting projects, Sabrina continued to release music. She currently has six albums under her belt.</p>

<p>In 2020, Sabrina also made her Broadway debut in <em>Mean Girls</em>, but the show closed shortly after because of the COVID pandemic. </p>



<p>While she&#8217;s worked on many projects over the past 10 years, Sabrina&#8217;s big breakout came with her 2022 album <em>Emails I Can&#8217;t Send</em>. The album included the hit &#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; which has become one of her signature songs.</p>



<p>In 2023 and 2024, Sabrina was one of the opening acts on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-gave-eras-tour-team-197-million-in-bonuses-ridiculous-generous-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift&#8217;s &#8220;Eras Tour.&#8221;</a> Not only did Swifties embrace her, but her beloved (and usually raunchy) &#8220;Nonsense&#8221; outros went viral multiple times.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-did-she-make-on-the-short-n-sweet-tour">How Much Did She Make On The &#8216;Short N&#8217; Sweet&#8217; Tour?</h2>



<p>Sabrina&#8217;s record <em>Short N&#8217; Sweet </em>was absolutely one of the biggest albums of this year. You couldn&#8217;t step outside and not hear &#8220;Espresso.&#8221; Plus, &#8220;Please Please Please&#8221; hit number one on the <em>Billboard </em>Hot 100 chart.</p>

<p>When the album dropped, it debuted on top of the <em>Billboard </em>200 albums chart, and it&#8217;s no surprise that the tour was also a smash.</p>



<p>Just days after tickets went on sale, the &#8220;Short N&#8217; Sweet&#8221; North American tour was sold out. Official data hasn&#8217;t been released yet, but it reportedly earned $27 million, according to <em><a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/sabrina-carpenter-net-worth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>.</em></p>



<p>While the North American dates are done, Sabrina is set to head out on a European leg of the tour, beginning in March 2025. </p>



<p>Sabrina definitely established herself as a force to be reckoned with on the pop charts in 2024. Fans can only be more excited to see what she has in store for 2025.</p>

<p>The couple was first spotted together during a dinner date in Los Angeles in December of 2023.</p>

<p>And judging by some of Sabrina&#8217;s racier lyrics on the subject of this relationship, things heated up rather quickly.</p>



<p>Alas, it seems they cooled off just as rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are both young and career-focused, so they&#8217;ve decided to take a break,&#8221; said the insider.</p>

<p>Career-focused they certainly are.</p>

<p>Sabrina even cast Barry to costar in her &#8220;Please, Please, Please&#8221; music video.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;Who&#8217;s the greatest actor that I can find for this music video?&#8217; And he was next to me in a chair. And he was so excited about it,&#8221; she said during a recent appearance on <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/sabrina-carpenter-on-short-n-sweet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS This Morning</a></em>.</p>



<p>Barry was equally effusive when discussing Sabrina&#8217;s Grammy nominations while appearing on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CxuM-yphxg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jess Cagle Show</a></em>.</p>



<p>“Brilliant, I know. Absolutely brilliant. F-ckin’ brilliant, lads,&#8221; Barry said.</p>

<p>“No, I’m really, really happy for her, honestly, and I got to get on the phone soon,” he continued.</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t know anyone who works as hard. I&#8217;m in awe watching her work and how committed and the standards that she sets,” Keoghan added. </p>



<p>“Especially being on that music video, just, she knows the vision. She knows what she wants.”</p>

<p>So it might be a lonelier holiday than expected for one of our favorite songstresses.</p>



<p>But at least <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-shades-mariah-carey-christmas-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina will have her new Christmas special </a>and her massive global success to keep her company.</p>



<p>We wish these two all the best!</p>

<p>Camila Cabello is finally acknowledging that there&#8217;s a song out there shading her.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve delved into the alleged love triangle between Sabrina Carpenter, Shawn Mendes, and Camila before.</p>



<p>Whispers of Camila reasserting herself in her ex&#8217;s life after he was out and about with Sabrina have exploded this year. Largely because Sabrina&#8217;s music seems to be calling her out.</p>



<p>Camila&#8217;s talking about it, and is responding with a tongue-in-cheek &#8220;you&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-1024x682.jpg" alt="Camila Cabello in autumn of 2024." class="wp-image-510996" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_01-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Camila Cabello speaks at Playlists To Podcasts: Unpacking What&#8217;s New And Next With Gen Z Culture, Featuring Rachel Lindsay And Camila Cabello at Advertising Week 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Noam Galai/Getty Images for The Galleria by Skylight in THE PENN DISTRICT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-a-song-about-camila-cabello">There is a song about Camila Cabello </h2>



<p>Camila Cabello was a guest on Alex Cooper&#8217;s Unwell Tour. As you can see below, there&#8217;s fan footage of her speaking.</p>



<p>“I have been lucky to contribute in many ways to the great music of the 21st century,” she boasted.</p>



<p>“Sometimes I have written them,&#8221; Camila continued. &#8220;Sometimes they have been written about me. So, you’re welcome, motherf&#8211;kers.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>On the surface, Camila Cabello might seem to be referring to almost any song. </p>



<p>After all, she has been in the music industry for years. (Yes, Fifth Harmony debuted in 2012)</p>



<p>However, much of the talk this year has been about Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s <em>Short n&#8217; Sweet</em> album. And, specifcally, about a couple of songs: &#8220;Coincidence&#8221; and &#8220;Taste.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="786" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-1024x786.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on October 9, 2024." class="wp-image-510997" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-1024x786.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-300x230.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-768x589.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-2048x1572.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-960x737.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-1080x829.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_sabrinacarpenter_01-1200x921.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter attends the 2024 Time100 Next at Chelsea Piers on October 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-songs-are-about-camila-cabello">What songs are about Camila Cabello?</h2>



<p>The song lyrics seem to refer to Camila Cabello swooping in to reignite things with Shawn Mendes, seemingly spurred by jealousy over her ex spending time with Sabrina. Whether that&#8217;s really how things went down, that&#8217;s how just about everyone is interpreting those lyrics.</p>



<p>Sabrina Carpenter knows that, and hasn&#8217;t attempted to clear the air. And, naturally, Camila Cabello knew that everyone would think of those songs. </p>



<p>Acknowledging that a song or two are about her isn&#8217;t the same as confirming what transpired behind the scenes. But many are taking this as confirmation of the love triangle drama. Why? Because neither woman seems to be disputing it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Camila Cabello on October 1, 2024." class="wp-image-510998" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_camilacabello_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Camila Cabello attends the Miu Miu Paris Womenswear S/S 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week at Palais d&#8217;Iena on October 01, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Victor Boyko/Getty Images for Miu Miu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;Coincidence,&#8221; the lyrics include: “The second I put my head on your chest / She knew, she’s got a real sixth sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>The lyrics then accuse: “Now her name comes up once, then it comes up twice / And without her even bein’ here, she’s back in your life / Now she’s in the same damn city on the same damn night.”</p>



<p>As we previously discussed, this does seem to match the timeline of Shawn Mendes&#8217; rumored time with Sabrina Carpenter and then him <em>suddenly </em>spending time with ex-girlfriend Camila Cabello.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Shawn Mendes on September 23, 2024." class="wp-image-510999" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1015_shawnmendes_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shawn Mendes performs on Mundo Stage as part of the Rock In Rio Festival at Cidade do Rock on September 23, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Wagner Meier/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sabrina-carpenter-sang-more-than-that">Sabrina Carpenter sang more than that</h2>



<p>In &#8220;Taste,&#8221; Sabrina Carpenter sings: “I heard you’re back together and if that’s true / You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whatever went down between Sabrina, Shawn, and Camila, we&#8217;re sure that the other two weren&#8217;t banking on Sabrina Carpenter being one of 2024&#8217;s biggest names in music.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t quite have this year&#8217;s song of the summer, but &#8220;Espresso&#8221; was a close runner up. Which means that all of her music has received a great deal of scrutiny. And Camila Cabello sounds like she&#8217;s eager to take credit for her role in Sabrina&#8217;s album.</p>

<p>Please, please, please &#8211; tell us if Sabrina Carpenter just shaded Mariah Carey?!</p>



<p>Because that&#8217;s what it looks like to us! </p>



<p>Now, just because <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-meaning-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s music</a> included some of this summer&#8217;s hottest songs doesn&#8217;t mean that she&#8217;s going into hibernation when the season&#8217;s change.</p>



<p>This winter, she&#8217;ll be hosting a variety music special on Netflix. A holiday special, no less. </p>



<p>But in promoting <em>A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter</em>, she&#8217;s seemingly threw a little shade at one of the biggest stars of all time. You probably know her best as the Queen of Christmas&#8230;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-netflix-picked-sabrina-carpenter-as-their-holiday-headliner">Netflix picked Sabrina Carpenter as their holiday headliner</h2>



<p>On December 6, Netflix will air the holiday variety music special, <em>A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter</em>.</p>



<p>We know that the special will feature &#8220;unexpected duets and comedic guests.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to the undisclosed guests, Sabrina will perform some of her own music.</p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter has a holiday EP, <em>Fruitcake</em>. While not as long as one of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/sabrina-carpenter-camila-cabello-feud-album-shawn-mendes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her full albums</a>, this collection of music should be much more appetizing than the EP&#8217;s namesake.</p>



<p>She will also be performing Christmas season classics. Netflix may be billing this as a &#8220;holiday&#8221; variety special, but though there are numerous holidays over the next few months, the title really sounds like it&#8217;s about <em>one </em>in particular.</p>



<p>“The holidays have always been so special to me,” Sabrina Carpenter expressed in a statement. “I am excited to bring my take to a classic holiday variety show &#8212; infusing my love of music and comedy to make something that is uniquely me.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-where-does-the-shade-towards-mariah-carey-come-in">So where does the shade towards Mariah Carey come in?</h2>



<p>As you can see in the <a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1836798443420852641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix teaser</a> for Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s special, the video clearly shades Mariah Carey &#8212; or, at least, refers to her.</p>



<p>The image evokes Mariah Carey&#8217;s classic &#8220;All I Want For Christmas Is You&#8221; outfit. It is essentially a fakeout, surprising people with Sabrina Carpenter.</p>



<p>This could blow up at Sabrina Carpenter (however unfairly) or at Netflix itself. But most people likely won&#8217;t resent the homage.</p>

<p>For years, Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;All I Want For Christmas I You&#8221; has been a harbinger of the entire holiday season. And we do mean holiday season &#8212; no matter what holidays you may celebrate between Halloween and New Year&#8217;s Day, Mariah Carey&#8217;s music will play.</p>



<p>Mariah did something almost unthinkable: she created a holiday classic in the modern era. A lot of Christmas songs are so old that they have either appalling values or cultural references that need explaining. &#8220;All I Want For Christmas Is You&#8221; came out in 1994.</p>



<p>Obviously, other music stars have come out with catchy Christmas tunes. But even if I <em>personally</em> enjoy Lady Gaga&#8217;s &#8220;Christmas Tree&#8221; and Guther &amp; The Sunshine Girls&#8217; &#8220;Christmas Song,&#8221; we can all acknowledge that Mariah&#8217;s bop is on a whole other level.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-1024x685.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-509714" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-2048x1369.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-960x642.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0919_sabrinacarpenter_02-1200x802.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter attends Variety&#8217;s 2024 Power of Young Hollywood party at the Santa Monica Proper Hotel, in Santa Monica, California, August 8, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MICHAEL TRAN/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-netflix-miss-the-mark">Did Netflix miss the mark?</h2>



<p>Anytime that someone seemingly shades Mariah Carey, whether it&#8217;s Sabrina Carpenter or someone else, they run the risk of it blowing up in their faces. Mariah has weathered real scandals and exercised poor judgment at times, but many people love and adore her. (Also, sometimes <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/nick-cannon-mariah-carey-back-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her judgment isn&#8217;t so bad</a>)</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t think that Netflix or Sabrina Carpenter meant Mariah Carey any disrespect. If anything, this is a nod to Mariah effectively owning a couple of months out of the year.</p>



<p>We hope that Mariah enjoys the flattery. And also the royalty checks as her song streams across the globe in a couple of months.</p>

<p>Fans have wanted the alleged Sabrina Carpenter love triangle explained for a while. We already know a lot.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/sabrina-carpenter-camila-cabello-feud-album-shawn-mendes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">After Sabrina Carpenter seemingly alluded</a> to Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-meaning-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her music</a>, public attention towards the alleged love triangle grew.</p>



<p>Outside of music, none of the three young, beautiful talents has directly addressed the tensions.</p>



<p>That may be about to change. If MTV gets their way, that could change on stage at the VMAs.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-683x1024.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter in August 2024." class="wp-image-508865" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0909_tri_01_sabrinacarpenter-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter attends Variety&#8217;s 2024 Power of Young Hollywood at Santa Monica Proper Hotel on August 08, 2024<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-vmas-could-see-sabrina-carpenter-shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello-s-love-triangle-on-stage">The VMAs could see Sabrina Carpenter, Shawn Mendes, and Camila Cabello&#8217;s love triangle on stage</h2>



<p>MTV sent out an invite to Sabrina Carpenter, Shawn Mendes, and Camila Cabello for the Wednesday, September 11 Video Music Awards.</p>



<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chappell-roan-sabrina-carpenter-rauw-alejandro-will-perform-at-2024-vmas-1235078436/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms</a> that all three will perform at the 2024 VMAs. So will others, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-is-chappell-roan-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including Chappell Roan</a>.</p>



<p>There are high hopes that featuring all three members of an alleged love triangle will unleash some drama. At least, MTV is almost certainly hoping for just that.</p>

<p>Remember, the VMAs have hosted historic moments before. The 2009 VMAs, which featured Lady Gaga&#8217;s memorable mashup of &#8220;Paparazzi&#8221; and &#8220;Poker Face,&#8221; also included Kanye West&#8217;s infamous interruption of Taylor Swift. </p>



<p>(It was but a prelude of what Ye would eventually become. Ominous foreshadowing, one might say)</p>



<p>But what exactly is the drama between Shawn Mendes, Sabrina Carpenter, and Camila Cabello? It may be that, like Lady Gaga in 2009, some viewers aren&#8217;t actually familiar with it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-want-the-alleged-love-triangle-explained-what-happened">Fans want the alleged love triangle explained! What happened?</h2>



<p>Memorably, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello entered a relationship in 2019. It seemed somewhat random and, at times, cringe. However, the young, hot couple continued dating until 2021, and seemed to part on good terms.</p>



<p>In April 2023, people spotted the two making out at Coachella. Sometimes, exes rekindle things &#8212; for a makeout session, a more serious hookup, or with a full reconciliation. No problem, right?</p>



<p>No problem &#8230; except that people had already spotted Sabrina Carpenter and Shawn Mendes out and about. Could they have just been friends? Sure. But there was a <em>widespread </em>belief that the two were dating. True or not, it seems to have motivated Camila to swoop in and reconnect with Shawn.</p>

<p>It seems like a thing of the past. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-barry-keoghan-breakup-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan</a> have very publicly been an item (however on-again, off-again) since then. Camila and Shawn both seem chill following their second breakup, too.</p>



<p>There was also the appearance that Camila is <em>single-white-femaling</em> (yes, it&#8217;s a verb) Sabrina, even going blonde.</p>



<p>Sabrina has poured allusions to this situation into her music, particular the songs &#8220;Taste&#8221; and &#8220;Coincidence.&#8221; If you&#8217;re familiar with the rumors that we just discussed, then none of it seems subtle. Fans even expect to hear about this situation when Shawn drops new music in October.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-vmas-expose-everything">Will the VMAs expose everything?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that any of the parties involved would agree to a scripted confrontation about the alleged love triangle at the Video Music Awards.</p>



<p>However, as we mentioned, <em>unscripted </em>scandals and confrontations have very famously gone down.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure that MTV would love to see Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s love triangle (alleged or otherwise) explained on live television. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/itssmelyssaa/status/1828458230185632144
</div></figure>



<p>However, even the possibility that Shawn and both gorgeous musicians will be there at the same time is stirring up interest.</p>



<p>Simply put, people can tell that MTV is doing this on purpose. Inviting Sabrina Carpenter makes as much sense as Chappell Roan. Shawn and Camila are famous and talented, but didn&#8217;t really make the same kind of splash in 2024.</p>



<p>Clearly, viewers and MTV alike are hoping that the three will make a splash on Wednesday night. Only time will tell. In the mean time, the above information is as close to the Sabrina Carpenter love triangle being explained as any of us are likely to get.</p>

<p>The Sabrina Carpenter song &#8220;Espresso&#8221; has a particular meaning. </p>



<p>Beyond just being a bop. Though it is. &#8220;Espresso&#8221; was a solid runner-up for Song of the Summer.</p>



<p>Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s music has entertained millions and dropped hints at a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/sabrina-carpenter-camila-cabello-feud-album-shawn-mendes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major celebrity feud</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Espresso&#8221; is a little different. What is the meaning of her lyrics?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-1024x685.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-508373" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-2048x1369.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-960x642.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_01-1200x802.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter attends Variety&#8217;s 2024 Power of Young Hollywood party at the Santa Monica Proper Hotel, in Santa Monica, California, August 8, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MICHAEL TRAN/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-meaning-of-espresso-by-sabrina-carpenter">What is the meaning of &#8216;Espresso&#8217; by Sabrina Carpenter?</h2>



<p>Sometimes mispronounced as &#8220;Expresso,&#8221; espresso is a coffee drink. Roughly speaking, it is to a regular cup of coffee what doing a shot of rum is to a rum-and-coke. That is to say, it&#8217;s a small amount of highly concentrated coffee for an intense jolt of caffeine.</p>



<p>Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. People use caffeine to remain awake and alert, which is often necessary under the crushing grind of work &#8212; especially in a society that caters to just one sleep cycle (morning people).</p>



<p>And caffeine&#8217;s stimulating effects go to the core of the meaning of Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;Espresso.&#8221; The short queen has a similar effect upon boys, her lyrics tease, as they lie awake thinking of her.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-682x1024.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on June 22, 2024." class="wp-image-508374" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_02-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter attends the Loewe Menswear Spring/Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 22, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images for Loewe)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In &#8220;Espresso,&#8221; Sabrina Carpenter even sings &#8220;Move it up, down, left, right, oh/Switch it up like Nintendo,&#8221; a reference to both portable video gaming and to inspiring masturbation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now he&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout me every night, oh. Is it that sweet? I guess so,&#8221; Sabrina Carpenter sings, spelling out the meaning of the song title. &#8220;Say you can&#8217;t sleep, baby, I know. That&#8217;s that me, espresso.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also sings &#8220;I know I Mountain Dew it for ya.&#8221; While <em>mountain dew </em>is a moonshine euphemism, it is best known as a polarizing brand of soda. Mountain Dew  has become synonymous with &#8220;bro&#8221; gamers for the past decade or so, and has plenty of caffeine.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sabrina-carpenter-adds-another-meaning-to-espresso">Sabrina Carpenter adds another meaning to &#8216;Espresso&#8217;</h2>



<p>Beyond the lyrics, she <a href="https://music.apple.com/ca/post/1741178891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> to <em>Apple Music</em> back in April, &#8220;Espresso&#8221; is also about unwinding and enjoying life. </p>



<p>Sabrina Carpenter recalled writing the song during &#8220;one of those times in my life where it was just like, I just thought I was the s&#8211;t in the moment.&#8221; In other words, during a rush of positive self-esteem.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I think you don&#8217;t always feel that way,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;So you kind of have to capture those moments that you do.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter on May 6, 2024." class="wp-image-508375" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Marleen Moise/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many things that symbolize fun, energy, and enjoyment. But Sabrina Carpenter settled upon &#8220;Espresso&#8221; for the song title.</p>



<p>&#8220;For me, equating it to caffeine and that addiction was really fun,&#8221; she expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I definitely have a caffeine addiction as it is,&#8221; Carpenter added relatably. &#8220;So it really ends up being a full circle for me.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="690" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-1024x690.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter performs on April 12, 2024." class="wp-image-508376" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-1024x690.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-300x202.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-768x517.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-2048x1380.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-960x647.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-1080x727.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_sabrinacarpenter_04-1200x808.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter performs on the Coachella Stage during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, on April 12, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-a-big-year-for-her">This is a big year for her</h2>



<p>As we said, &#8220;Espresso&#8221; was a strong runner-up for 2024&#8217;s song of the summer. (That title does belong to Chappell Roan&#8217;s &#8220;Good Luck Babe,&#8221; however)</p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jake-gyllenhaal-snl-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touring with Taylor Swift</a> to having her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-barry-keoghan-breakup-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship with Barry Keoghan</a> under the spotlight, this beloved short queen  has become impossible to ignore.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad that she was feeling herself and wrote &#8220;Espresso.&#8221; Because the song is fantastic. But also because she deserves to delight in who she is and what she&#8217;s accomplished.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s not hard to see why.</p>



<p>Sabrina dominated the summer with a slew of successful singles. And one of them seemed to hint at trouble in her relationship with the <em>Saltburn</em> star.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sabrina-carpenter-blasts-barry-keoghan-in-song">Sabrina Carpenter Blasts Barry Keoghan In Song</h2>



<p>&#8220;Please Please Please&#8221; has been burning up the charts, which must be a bittersweet experience for Barry.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure he was happy to see his girlfriend&#8217;s song<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Please_Please_Please_(Sabrina_Carpenter_song)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rise to number one on the <em>Billboard</em> charts</a>.</p>



<p>But the lyrics contain some references to their relationship that aren&#8217;t exactly flattening to Barry.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I heard that you&#8217;re an actor, so act like a standup guy,&#8221; Sabrina sings at one point.</p>



<p>&#8220;I tell them it&#8217;s just your culture, and everyone rolls their eyes,&#8221; goes another line, an apparent reference to Barry&#8217;s Irish stoicism.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, the song sparked rumors that Sabrina and Barry had broken up.</p>

<p>But then Barry appeared in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF1Na4AIecM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the video for &#8220;Please Please Please,&#8221;</a> and the speculation was put to rest. At least for a while.</p>



<p>These days, the breakup rumors are so prevalent that <em><a href="https://people.com/barry-keoghan-reacts-to-sabrina-carpenter-surprise-song-busy-woman-amid-breakup-rumors-instagram-8704389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> magazine is reporting on them.</p>



<p>And once again, fans aren&#8217;t quite sure what to think.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jake-gyllenhaal-snl-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina&#8217;s career</a> is still taking off like a shot, and last week, she released a surprise song entitled &#8220;Busy Woman.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2165414456-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter attends The Drop: Sabrina Carpenter at GRAMMY Museum L.A.

<p>And once again, Barry&#8217;s involvement with the song&#8217;s release seems to indicate that he and Sabrina are still together.</p>



<p>“Lets f&#8212;in go!!” he wrote on an Instagram post promoting the single.</p>



<p>“[‘Bed Chem’ is] my fave just sayin m’darlin @sabrinacarpenter,&#8221; Barry added, referring to a Sabrina song that&#8217;s believed to be a tribute to their relationship. </p>



<p>So while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/sabrina-carpenter-camila-cabello-feud-album-shawn-mendes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina&#8217;s relationship drama</a> probably isn&#8217;t over, for now, it looks as though she and Barry are still together.</p>

<p>Barry and Sabrina are so private about their relationship that they still haven&#8217;t publicly confirmed that they&#8217;re dating.</p>



<p>But she seems to enjoy expressing her views on her love life in song form. And we&#8217;re sure that her fans enjoy dissecting her lyrics for clues.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/sabrina-carpenter-skims-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina opened for Taylor Swift</a> throughout much of the Eras Tour.</p>



<p>The singers&#8217; similarities go beyond the fact that both are incredibly talented pop icons.</p>



<p>Sabrina and Taylor realized early on that if you have to endure heartbreak, you might as well transform your pain into wildly lucrative art! </p>



<p>And in both cases, fans love them for their honesty.</p>
