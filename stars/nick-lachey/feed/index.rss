<p><em>Love Is Blind</em> reunion shows are always a bit messy.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve got happily married couples celebrating their first anniversaries while seated next to single people who recently got dumped at the altar.</p>



<p>And in between are Nick and Vanessa Lachey, who are indeed married — but if <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/nick-lachey-ordered-to-attend-alcoholics-anonymous-anger-management-after-altercation-with-photographer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick&#8217;s recent brush with the law</a> is any indication, &#8220;happily&#8221; might be an overstatement in their case.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Anyway, this year&#8217;s reunion contained plenty of surprises and more than a few intensely awkward moments. So let&#8217;s get into it:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-love-is-blind-reunion-recap-which-couples-are-still-married">Love Is Blind Reunion Recap: Which Couples Are Still Married?</h2>



<p>First the good news: Two couples — Garret and Taylor, and Tyler and Ashley — are still married one year later!</p>



<p>&#8220;When you get married you become a unit… and home is with Garrett, and I&#8217;m excited to figure out this next chapter with you,&#8221; Taylor told her husband on last night&#8217;s reunion.</p>



<p>Of course, Tyler and Ashley&#8217;s situation is a little more complicated, what with his unusual family situation and all.</p>



<p>Yes, as you&#8217;re probably aware, Tyler has been accused of misrepresenting his relationship with the mother of his three children.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-1024x573.png" alt="The cast of Love Is Blind Season 7." class="wp-image-512318" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-1024x573.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-300x168.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-768x430.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-960x537.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-1080x604.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM-1200x671.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.34.08-AM.png 1584w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cast of Love Is Blind Season 7.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>He initially insisted that he had served as a sperm donor, but <a href="https://people.com/love-is-blind-season-7-reunion-biggest-bombshells-8736541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media sleuths determined that he had a relationship with the kids</a> and even spent holidays with them. But it seems the couple has weathered that storm, and their relationship is still intact.</p>



<p>While Ashley acknowledged that Tyler lied when he told her his kids don&#8217;t even know what he looks like, she insists that the social media rumors about his family situation are untrue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who has better insight on what&#8217;s going on? Social media or me? For people to imply that she was blindsided, she didn&#8217;t know, is insulting to my intelligence,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For the record, this is something he never wanted to share on camera. I just didn&#8217;t feel like it would be an authentic experience … if we didn&#8217;t [discuss this.]&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There has never been a day that she hasn&#8217;t said &#8216;I love you.&#8217; … I&#8217;ve never experienced unconditional love to this extent… it&#8217;s the first time in my life experiencing this,&#8221; Tyler said. Whatever works!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nick-dorka-allegedly-was-on-the-hunt-for-fame-not-love">Nick Dorka Allegedly Was on the Hunt For Fame, Not Love</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="687" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-687x1024.png" alt="Nick Dorka appears on the Love Is Blind Season 7 reunion." class="wp-image-512321" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-687x1024.png 687w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-201x300.png 201w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-768x1145.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-644x960.png 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-724x1080.png 724w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM-805x1200.png 805w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-10.54.15-AM.png 1038w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nick Dorka appears on the Love Is Blind Season 7 reunion.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And with that, we move on to the other <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/love-is-blind-season-7-spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Is Blind</a></em> guy who&#8217;s been widely accused of being less than honest with his partner.</p>



<p>Unlike Tyler and Ashley, Nick and Hannah did <em>not</em> get married, and that&#8217;s clearly for the best.</p>



<p>Hannah was widely criticized for being unnecessarily cruel to Nick throughout the season. And the criticism was completely fair, as she roasted him for everything from his appearance to his intellect to his financial situation.</p>



<p>Seems like it would&#8217;ve been easier to just dump the guy, but then Hannah wouldn&#8217;t have been able to remain on the show. Gotta think strategically sometimes.</p>



<p>But on the reunion, Hannah turned the tables by claiming that <em>Nick</em> was the one chasing fame.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-682x1024.png" alt="Hannah Jiles on the Love Is Blind reunion." class="wp-image-512322" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-682x1024.png 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-200x300.png 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-768x1153.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-639x960.png 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-719x1080.png 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM-799x1200.png 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.02.03-AM.png 1040w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hannah Jiles on the Love Is Blind reunion.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>She claimed that during filming, she found a notebook in which Nick had outlined his &#8220;90 Day Goals.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sadly, this was not a scheme to join the cast of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/big-ed-brown-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90 Day Fiance</a></em>. Rather, Nick sought to sell two houses, get in shape, and become &#8220;the most famous person ever on Love Is Blind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whoops. Other cast members corroborated that Nick was &#8220;calculated&#8221; and &#8220;obsessed with fame&#8221; and made disparaging comments about Hannah&#8217;s appearance.</p>



<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a good thing these two didn&#8217;t get hitched.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-awkward-return-of-ramses">The Awkward Return of Ramses</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="571" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM-1024x571.png" alt="Ramses on the Love Is Blind Season 7 reunion." class="wp-image-512324" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM-1024x571.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM-300x167.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM-2048x1143.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-11.09.13-AM.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ramses on the Love Is Blind Season 7 reunion.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The same could be said of Ramses and Marissa. </p>



<p>He might be the most hated LiB star since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/shake-chatterjee-to-nick-lachey-your-boy-band-sucked-and-you-abu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Chatterjee</a>, but at least we got to see Ramses get roasted by Marissa&#8217;s mom yet again last night.</p>



<p>In the end, the important thing is that he and Marissa dodged a bullet by not getting hitched. And that&#8217;s also true of Stephen and Monica.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s <em>doubly</em> true of Leo and Brittany! Yikes, were those two awkward!</p>



<p>Love might be blind, but at least it&#8217;s occasionally cautious, too!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Nick Lachey has been ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings &#8212; along with anger management classes &#8212; one year after being charged with assault and battery against a member of the paparazzi.</p>



<p>The incident in question took place in March 2022 after Lachey allegedly attacked photographer Jody Santos.</p>



<p>The aforementioned punishments are in place for one year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Going back just over a year, footage from last March features Lachey walking over to Santos’ car&#8230; attempting to grab her phone &#8230; and cursing at her after realizing she was taking photos of him and his wife, Vanessa Lachey. </p>



<p>The Daily Mail reported at the time that he was charged with assault and battery.</p>



<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the Los Angeles District attorney explained:</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Lachey has not been charged with misdemeanor assault and battery. Instead he is participating in LADA’s Prefiling Diversion program which was established in 2017. </p>



<p>&#8220;As part of these conditions he must participate in anger management classes and attend Alcoholic Anonymous meetings. Successful completion of the Prefiling Diversion Program will result in no criminal charges being filed.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Said Santos today:</p>



<p>“In all my years of photographing celebrities, no one has ever tried to hit me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am just relieved that I rolled up my window as fast as I did, otherwise he would have knocked me out. No doubt about it&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have taken photos of him plenty of times and never had a problem, but this time was different.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Santos also claimed last year that Lachey called her a &#8220;psy mother fker,&#8221; shoved his arm through my car window, and tried to grab my cell phone,&#8221; adding that she &#8220;could smell alcohol on his breath for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What he did was wrong,&#8221; she added. </p>



<p>&#8220;Attempting to bust his fist through my car window when all I was doing was taking photographs of him. He should have been thanking me for the free publicity. </p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, really. Talk about an oversized ego.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Santos further alleged that she “heard Vanessa say, ‘Go get ’em, open the door,’ and then he started walking towards my car all aggressive.” </p>



<p>After rolling up her car window, the photographer said that Nick punched the glass so hard “I thought he was going to break his hand.” </p>



<p>She emphasized: I am surprised he didn’t shatter the window.”</p>





<p>For his part, Lachey Tweeted about the incident one day after it happened. </p>



<p>“Last night, after enjoying a great dinner with my wife and our dear friend, the paparazzi harassed us as we walked back to our hotel,” he wrote on March 27, 2022. </p>



<p>“I clearly overreacted. I’ve been in this game long enough to know that their antics are sadly part of the deal. Stupid of me. Done.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Folks,&nbsp;it brings us no pleasure to inform you that Shake Chatterjee is at it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since he horrified viewers with his behavior on <a href="/2022/02/love-is-blind-season-2-finale-who-got-engaged-who-bailed-at-the/"><em>Love Is Blind</em> Season 2</a>, the Chicago-based veterinarian has been making a name for himself as one of reality TV&rsquo;s most horrendous villains.</p>
<p>He started out by informing the entire world that he wasn&rsquo;t <a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-to-deepti-vempati-sorry-i-kept-calling-you-ugly/">attracted to Deepti Vempati</a>, which was rather inconvenient, considering that at the time, the two of them were engaged.</p>
<p>Once he&rsquo;d thoroughly humiliated Deepti and her family, Shake turned his attention to antagonizing Nick Lachey.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After butting heads with the LiB host during the reunion show, Chatterjee decided to keep the feud going by <a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-trashes-love-is-blind-host-nick-lachey-youre-a/">calling Lachey a &quot;twat&quot;</a> on Instagram.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, he doubled down on his attack and accused Nick of being <a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-nick-lachey-was-emotionally-abusive-to-jessica/">emotionally abusive to Jessica Simpson</a> during their brief marriage.</p>
<p>Yes, Shake is so serious about taking Lachey down that he went back and watched old episodes of <em>The Newlyweds</em> just so he could dig up dirt on his new rival.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s commitment!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="754" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1024x754.jpg" alt="Jessica Simpson Hat" class="wp-image-226182" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-300x221.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-768x565.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1536x1130.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-2048x1507.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-735x541.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-335x247.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-347x255.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-520x383.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-640x471.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-960x707.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1080x795.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Anyway, on the reunion, Shake mentioned that Nick&#8217;s wife, Vanessa Lachey, was the only woman on the stage whom he was attracted to.</p>
<p>Did we mention this guy is a massive douche?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have our physical preferences,&rdquo; he said at the time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, every woman here is beautiful, I think you&rsquo;re all beautiful, I&rsquo;m not attracted to all of you. Unfortunately, the only one I&rsquo;m attracted to is Vanessa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/where-love-is-blinds-abhishek-shake-stands-with-nick-lachey/">recent interview</a> with <em>Us Weekly</em>, Shake doubled down on these remarks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a compliment unless you&rsquo;re an insecure, insecure guy,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re insecure then, yeah, any anything&rsquo;s upsetting if you&rsquo;re an insecure guy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-deepti-vempati-sucks-my-new-girlfriend-is-so-mu/">Chatterjee has a new girlfriend</a>, and he encouraged Nick to make comments about how much he&#8217;d like to bang her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, tell me how attracted you are to Emily,&rdquo; Shake told Us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me she&rsquo;s beautiful. She&rsquo;s gorgeous. She&rsquo;s hot, but she&rsquo;s mine. You can look, but you can&rsquo;t touch, pal.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Shake then returned to the subject of Nick&#8217;s public interactions with Jessica during their time together.</p>
<p>&quot;Honestly, he treated Jessica Simpson like garbage for years,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And guess what? That&rsquo;s documented big boy. All right, 98 degrees,&quot; Chatterjee continued, referring to Nick&#8217;s popular nineties boy band.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you kidding me? More like 32 degrees. You haven&rsquo;t been 98 degrees since 1998 pal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We&#8217;re not here to defend Nick&#8217;s actions, but we <em>will</em> point out that he and Jessica were making a reality show that was at least partially scripted, so we probably can&#8217;t tell everything about their marriage from the scenes that made it to MTV.</p>
<p>At that point, Shake took issue with claims that by focusing so heavily on Deepti&#8217;s appearance, he undermined the entire premise of <em>Love Is Blind</em>.</p>
<p>He suggested that Nick is a hypocrite for claiming that love is blind, even though he met his first wife on a music video set.</p>
<p>&quot;Is love blind or did you meet on the set of a music video&quot; Shake said.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Like, OK. Then you come on here and tell me how I treat people [poorly] and talk to people. You single me out when you&rsquo;re supposed to be an impartial host, like, bro, you&rsquo;re a washed-up nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t think Nick was saying that <em>everybody</em> should get engaged before laying eyes on their fianc&eacute;.</p>
<p>He was just correctly pointing out that that&#8217;s the premise of the show on which Shake was appearing.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We understand that Shake is doing everything that he can to remain relevant these days.</p>
<p>But someone should probably tell the guy that he&#8217;s gonna need better arguments if he wants to keep this one-way feud interesting!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>If you watched <a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-blasts-love-is-blind-co-star-kyle-abrams-youre/"><em>Love Is Blind</em> Season 2</a>, then we probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that Shake Chatterjee is the absolute worst.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost hard to put into words how badly this guy sucks.</p>
<p>Dude makes Juan Pablo from <em>The Bachelor</em> look like Prince Charming, and he&#8217;ll forever be remembered as one of the most egregious villains in the history of reality dating shows.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s every single woman&#8217;s worst nightmare, but as far as casting directors are concerned, Chaterjee is pure gold.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After all, nothing helps a show like LiB set itself apart from the pack quite like a world-class d-bag making it through an entire season.</p>
<p>So perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised by the news that the legend of Shake will live on with a new show focusing entirely on the villainous veterinarian&#8217;s search for love!</p>
<p>Yes, the Animal Planet network is getting into the dating show game with a new series entitled <em>Shake-Up to Breakup</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s animal attraction gone wild, as everyone&#8217;s least favorite pet doctor seeks his mate among Chicago&#8217;s most eligible singles,&quot; reads a press release from the network.</p>
<p>&quot;But before the ladies can become Mrs. Chatterjee, they&#8217;ll have their lives <em>shaken up</em> as Shake puts their love to the test with a series of awkward and degrading challenges.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, apparently, each episode will involve Shake meeting with his potential mate&#8217;s family and seeing how much horrendous behavior they&#8217;ll put up with before someone goes all Will Smith on his ass.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Sir, I don&#8217;t mean to be disrespectful,&quot; Chatterjee says to one contestant&#8217;s father in a clip from the series premiere.</p>
<p>&quot;But your daughter is straight-up fugly, my dude. Like, if she&#8217;s adopted, I hope you kept the receipt, &#8217;cause it might not be too late to make an exchange, ya know what I mean?&quot;</p>
<p>At that point, Shake holds up his hand for a high-five, but the girl&#8217;s father seems uninterested.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Needless to say, this is must-see viewing.</p>
<p>In an Instagram post that appeared on his page just moments ago, Shake excitedly shared the news with fans:</p>
<p>&quot;Yo, whattup, everybody? This is Shake-<em>spear</em>. The ladies know why they call me that, up top!&quot; Chatterjee began.</p>
<p>Yet again, he held up his hand for a high five, which was odd, as it looked as though no one was in the room with him.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I just wanted to let y&#8217;all know about my new show on Animal Planet. You&#8217;re gonna want to put the kids to bed before you check it out, &#8217;cause ya boy Shake is gonna be getting his mate on, ya feel me?&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re up on the latest LiB drama, you know that <a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-trashes-love-is-blind-host-nick-lachey-youre-a/">Shake recently called Nick Lachey a twat </a>and professed his attraction to Nick&#8217;s wife and co-host, Vanessa Lachey.</p>
<p>So perhaps we should&#8217;ve seen this next part coming:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;First few episodes are in the can, but we&#8217;re still looking for new contestants, and I&#8217;d like to personally invite Vanessa to come down and audition,&quot; Shake told the camera.</p>
<p>&quot;Girl, I know you&#8217;ve been tolerating 98 degrees, but you give me a chance and I&#8217;ll broil that ass at 500 for three to four minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not totally sure what that means, but we&#8217;re guessing Nick isn&#8217;t too happy about it.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>At that point, Chatterjee stood up and started twerking to &quot;Milkshake&quot; by Kelis.</p>
<p>And as much as we wish all of this had actually happened, this article was just an April Fools&#8217; Day gag.</p>
<p>But hey &#8212; Animal Planet, if you decide to go in this direction, you better break us off a finders&#8217; fee!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Usually, reality TV hosts serve as impartial observers/occasional referees while overseeing reunion episodes.</p>
<p>But Nick and Vanessa Lachey chose to go a different route, and they might be regretting that decision these days.</p>
<p>If you watched <a href="/2022/02/love-is-blind-season-2-finale-who-got-engaged-who-bailed-at-the/"><em>Love Is Blind</em> Season 2</a> then you&#8217;re well aware that Shake Chatterjee is a massive douche who got what was coming to him on the reunion show.</p>
<p>But perhaps Nick and Vanessa should have let the cast tend to the matter themselves, because now Nick is getting dragged into the sort of petty D-list beef that he would probably prefer to avoid at this stage in his career.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>The feud between Nick and his unexpected rival started when <a href="/2022/03/shake-chatterjee-trashes-love-is-blind-host-nick-lachey-youre-a/">Shake called Lachey a &quot;twat&quot;</a> in a recent social media tirade.</p>
<p>Chatterjee&#8217;s comments came in response to harsh words that both Nick and Vanessa directed at the Chicago-based veterinarian.</p>
<p>Some viewers applauded the Lacheys for laying down the law, while others thought it was a little strange for the <em>hosts</em> to be raising their voices and dropping f-bombs.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Shake is firmly in the latter camp, and he&#8217;s been firing off criticisms of Nick ever since the reunion aired.</p>
<p>(Vanessa has been immune to Shake&#8217;s criticism &#8212; more on that later.)</p>
<p>Chatterjee&#8217;s anti-Lachey campaign continued on Monday when Shake posted a clip from Nick&#8217;s 2003-2005 MTV series <em>The Newlyweds.</em></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For our younger readers, the show focused on Nick&#8217;s marriage to Jessica Simpson, and it was quite the phenomenon at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not the sort of show that one frequently revisits in reruns, which is good thing for Nick, as some of his behavior arguably hasn&#8217;t aged very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound on,&rdquo; Shake wrote in an Instagram Story posted on Monday.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;@NickLachey not even opening the car door for his wife. Sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clip showed Nick refusing to unlock the car door for Jessica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of our marriage, you were so eager to open the door for me,&rdquo; Simpson said.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="754" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1024x754.jpg" alt="Jessica Simpson Hat" class="wp-image-226182" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-300x221.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-768x565.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1536x1130.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-2048x1507.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-735x541.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-335x247.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-347x255.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-520x383.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-640x471.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-960x707.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/jessica-simpson-hat-1080x795.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because at the beginning of our marriage I got laid,&quot; Lachey shot back.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the worst example of Nick&#8217;s behavior that Shake could find, then his case is pretty weak.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re sure he&#8217;ll continue disparaging Lachey regardless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put a doctor on the show&hellip; of course you were going to see some critical thinking,&rdquo; Chatterjee wrote on Instagram on March 7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, @nicklachey you&rsquo;re a massive twat for your comment dragging vets. You do realize that becoming a veterinarian considerably more difficult than becoming a human doc right?</p>
<p>&quot;Also consider learning how to be an impartial host before the season 3 reunion airs. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t play along with your narrative like the rest of these puppets. Say hi to @vanessalachey for me.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Say what you will about Shake, the man is nothing if not honest.</p>
<p>He copped to being attracted to Vanessa on the reunion show, and according to his ex-fiancee, Deepti Vempati, he made no effort to hide that attraction during filming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I tell you, he was hitting on her at the couples reveal,&rdquo; Deepti said during a March 8 podcast interview.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so disrespectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, Disrespectful is pretty much Shake&#8217;s middle name.</p>
<p>But fortunately for Deepti, the man is Nick&#8217;s problem now!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Abhishek &quot;Shake&quot; Chatterjee has some harsh words for Nick Lachey.</p>
<p>Following the pair&#8217;s heated exchange on the Love Is Blind Season 2 reunion, the veterinarian jumped on Instagram March 7 to share his unfiltered thoughts on the singer&#8230; who told Shake that he understood why he treats animals and not humans, claiming he doesn&#8217;t know how to treat the latter.</p>
<p>Chatterjee used some explicit language in doing so, however.</p>
<p>Consider yourself warned&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;re a massive twat for your comment dragging vets,&quot; Shake wrote in a since-deleted post, adding the following with an apparent straight face:</p>
<p>&quot;You do realize that becoming a veterinarian [is] considerably more difficult than becoming a human doc right?&quot;</p>
<p>Some folks out there may disagree with that statement.</p>
<p>By which we mean, absolutely everyone out there most likely disagrees with that statement.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Added Chatterjee on social media, continuing to drag Lachey and even bringing up the artist&#8217;s co-host/wife:</p>
<p>&quot;Also consider learning how to be an impartial host before the season 3 reunion airs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry I didn&#8217;t play along with your narrative like the rest of these puppets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say hi to @vanessalachey for me.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As mentioned above, this post is no longer on Instagram, yet Shake wrote on his Instagram Story that the post &quot;got taken down&quot; for some reason beyond his control.</p>
<p>&quot;Censor much?,&quot; Shake added, uplooading an article featuring his comments about Lachey in <em>another</em> Instagram Story update.&#8217;</p>
<p>Chatterjee, of course, has faced extreme backlash all season long for the negative way in which he spoke about women on air, most notably his now ex-fianc&eacute;e Deepti Vempati.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This total and complete loser previously confessed to not feeling &quot;an intense physical connection&quot; for her, while Vempati eventually left Chatterjee at that altar to wrap up Season 2 because she desired &quot;somebody who knows for sure&quot; that they want to be with her.</p>
<p>After the season concluded?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Apparently leaning in to the reality TV villain label,&nbsp;<a href="/2022/03/love-is-blind-star-has-no-regrets-still-thinks-ex-partner-is-ugl/">Shake made it clear he had no regrets</a> over how he acted.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing I don&#8217;t feel inclined to do is to pretend I&#8217;m sad or sorry about certain things &#8212; certain things that were out of my control, certain things that I can&#8217;t necessarily even speak about,&quot;&nbsp;Chatterjee said last week amid the criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not sorry. I&#8217;m not sorry!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I think I handled the situation as best as anybody in my situation could.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#8217;t have to like me. Only I have to like me, thankfully.&quot;</p>
<p>During Friday&#8217;s reunion, meanwhile, Chatterjee found himself in scalding hot water when Vanessa Lachey went after him for how he &quot;berated&quot; all the women on the show over their physical appearance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, Nick stepped in after Chatterjee talked about his <em>own</em> physical preferences.</p>
<p>&quot;We all have our physical preferences. Listen, every woman in here is beautiful. I think you&#8217;re all beautiful,&quot; Shake said.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not attracted to all of you. Unfortunately, the only one I&#8217;m attracted to is Vanessa &#8211; and I wish I wasn&#8217;t! I wish I wasn&#8217;t.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;The point is, it&#8217;s not a choice,&quot; he continued, digging himself a deeper and deeper hole.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#8217;t choose. It&#8217;s nature, baby. We&#8217;re animals.&quot;</p>
<p>Fired back Nick said in response:</p>
<p>&quot;No, you treat animals. We&#8217;re human beings. There&#8217;s a big difference.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In his Instagram reply, Shake attached Nick for not being an &quot;impartial host,&quot; adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry I didn&#8217;t play along with your narrative like the rest of these puppets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You put a doctor on the show&#8230; of course you&#8217;re going to see some critical thinking.&quot;</p>
