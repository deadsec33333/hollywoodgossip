<p>Clayton Echard has some very harsh words for his ex-girlfriend.</p>



<p>A few days after Gabby Windey criticized Echard&#8217;s online dancing videos on the April 3 episode of the “Las Culturistas” podcast, Echard via Instagram.</p>



<p>In very personal fashion. </p>

<p>“Gabby, what you’re doing is bullying. There’s no other way around it,” Echard said on April 6, addressing Windey telling Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers that Echard’s dancing posts “will make you run … you’ll wish you didn’t have eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Clayton went on as follows:</p>



<p>“You’re attacking me for my physical appearance, you’re attacking me for a passion that I love that’s changed my life. It’s unnecessary and it’s not funny.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have such a large platform and you’re setting a really bad example, which is just disheartening. I don’t want people to be scared to try something new because [of] bullying online, like what you’re doing. Do better Gabby.”</p>

<p>Echard dated Windey on The Bachelor and then ultimately dumped her &#8212; as well as Rachel Recchia &#8212; to pursue a relationship with Susie Evans.</p>



<p>He previously admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clayton-echard-reveals-suicidal-thoughts-says-susie-evans-saved-me/">having had suicidal thoughts</a> and has shared videos of himself dancing for the camera since 2023.</p>



<p>Echard also went <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/clayton-echard-served-with-lawsuit-ex-lover-claims-he-impregnated-her-with-twins/">through a paternity scandal</a> that same year, which eventually proved Clayton to be correct.</p>



<p>He <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/clayton-echard-celebrates-paternity-test-results-i-told-everyone-i-was-innocent/">did NOT father any kids the woman</a> who accused him of doing so at the time.</p>

<p>While Echard received support from fans who commented on his Instagram response, a handful pointed out that Windey’s podcast remarks may have been taken out of context. </p>



<p>“I really think she was just being cheeky and sarcastic in the podcast,” one person wrote, for example. “I do agree she took it too far, but I don’t think that was her intention.”</p>



<p>But Echard explained in his video that dancing has helped him evolve as a human. He takes it very, very seriously.</p>

<p>“[Dancing] has brought so much self love and self confidence that I’m truly so grateful to have found something that I get to work on myself every day and challenge myself,” he said. </p>



<p>“I’m not the greatest at it and I’m aware of that, I’m not delusional but it’s me versus me every single day I get into that studio and it’s movement therapy and it’s allowed me to release a lot of my anger and frustrations.”</p>



<p>Clayton added that he hadn’t talked to Windey &#8212; who served as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a> alongside Recchia in 2022 &#8212; “in three years,” but that Windey continues “to take shots at me and it’s just unnecessary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Windey has not yet responded to this takedown.</p>

<p>Clayton Echard is taking a victory lap.</p>



<p>As previously reported, the former <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/clayton-echard-served-with-lawsuit-ex-lover-claims-he-impregnated-her-with-twins/">Bachelor lead was sued this summer</a> by a woman who claimed she slept with the reality star several months ago&#8230; and was now pregnant with his baby as a result.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/clayton-echard-says-truth-will-set-you-free-amid-bombshell-paternity-scandal/">Echard strongly denied this claim</a>, however.</p>



<p>He said the two only engaged in oral sex and there&#8217;s simply no change the impending child belongs to him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="518" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/after-the-final-rose-the-roses-have-all-been-handed-out-the-news-photo-1640209780.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-484924" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/after-the-final-rose-the-roses-have-all-been-handed-out-the-news-photo-1640209780.jpg 619w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/after-the-final-rose-the-roses-have-all-been-handed-out-the-news-photo-1640209780-300x251.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/after-the-final-rose-the-roses-have-all-been-handed-out-the-news-photo-1640209780-335x280.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/after-the-final-rose-the-roses-have-all-been-handed-out-the-news-photo-1640209780-347x290.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/after-the-final-rose-the-roses-have-all-been-handed-out-the-news-photo-1640209780-520x435.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clayton Echard is all smiles here while appearing on a Bachelor special.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>He&#8217;s now been proven correct, too.</p>



<p>“Listen, it’s Friday and you know what we need on a Friday? We need some good news and who has got the good news today? I got the good news today,” Echard said via an Instagram video on October 6. </p>



<p>“The test results came back early and they said little to no fetal DNA present. </p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s go baby! I knew that was going to happen and thankfully five months of torture can finally be put to rest.”</p>

<p>According to various text messages the aforementioned woman released a couple months ago, Echard responded to the baby allegation with some harsh words.</p>



<p><strong><em>I don’t believe you for a second</em></strong>, he allegedly wrote, along with: </p>



<p><strong><em>I legitimately hate you right now</em></strong>&#8230;<em><strong> You have lost your mind and I hope YOU think about how terrible this is that you would subject me to this </strong></em>and <em><strong>My personal hell would be having to have you be a part of my life</strong></em>.</p>



<p>Assuming he really was wrongly accused, we can sort of now see where Clayton was coming from at the time.</p>

<p>“Two false accusations in two years — I really don’t want to look ahead to next year to see what will happen,&#8221; added Echard on Friday.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think two false accusations in a lifetime is enough. … This has been a trying time but I learned so much about myself and now back to the regularly scheduled program.” </p>



<p>For those unaware, was also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/clayton-echard-trashes-ridiculous-cheating-accusations-provides/">accused of cheating on Susie Evans</a> awhile back, an allegation that also ended up being false.</p>

<p>The 33-year old unnamed woman at the center of this controversy, meanwhile, spoke to Us Weekly on Friday and said Clayton is still &#8220;lying.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I just heard from the lab. Here is the relevant part of the [phone] call. Regardless of what Clayton says, the test is not inconclusive,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>The ‘testing is ongoing’ because they said that there was an issue with my sample and that they need another sample from me, which I am giving first thing on Wednesday.</p>



<p>&#8220;They have to send a testing kit from Maryland to Arizona, so that’s why there is a delay and why I can’t get it done on Monday.&#8221;</p>



<p>Citing an employee at the facility, the woman concluded:</p>



<p>“Brett said that Clayton has been told specifically that even if it were to come back ‘inconclusive’ after this, it definitely does not mean I’m not pregnant and agrees he has misled his followers by saying that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clayton Echard is looking to clear his name.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we learned that the former <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/clayton-echard-served-with-lawsuit-ex-lover-claims-he-impregnated-her-with-twins/">Bachelor lead had been sued by an unidentified woman</a> after she claims the pair had sexual intercourse on May 20.</p>



<p>This woman says she got pregnant as a result of this action&#8230; and that Echard has:</p>



<p>First, been denying he&#8217;s the father of her impending twins; second, pressuring her to get an abortion; third, insisting he&#8217;ll play <em>no</em> rule on the role of these children.</p>

<p>Along with her lawsuit, the accuser included with it “erratic, illogical and threatening messages” from Echard, along with screenshots of texts he reportedly sent her.</p>



<p>These messages included comments such as: </p>



<p>“I don’t believe you for a second,” “I legitimately hate you right now,” “You have lost your mind and I hope YOU think about how terrible this is that you would subject me to this” and “My personal hell would be having to have you be a part of my life.”</p>



<p>In an interview with The Sun this week, Echard said he and this partner only engaged in oral sex.</p>

<p>Now, meanwhile, Echard has fired back in even more direct and practical fashion.</p>



<p>On Thursday night, the 30-year-old posted a screenshot of a receipt for a paternity test in order to clear the air after he was named in this paternity lawsuit in August.</p>



<p>“This is the timeline. The truth will always set you free,” Echard wrote over the email receipt in an upload to his Instagram Story. </p>



<p>Based on the screenshot, the reality star paid $725 to schedule an appointment on September 27 with a paternity clinic.</p>

<p>Echard followed this post up five hours later with another slide on his account&#8230; where he claimed he&#8217;d been made aware of &#8212; and been able to verify &#8212; that this lawsuit wasn&#8217;t a first for the unnamed woman.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been notified (and have confirmed) that there are other individuals out there with nearly identical accusations being made against them by the exact same person,&#8221; he wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the court cases are still publicly accessible and active.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the two parties take their blood/DNA tests, they are scheduled for an early resolution conference and will appear in court immediately on September 28.</p>

<p>This scandal comes nearly one year after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/clayton-echard-and-susie-evans-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-absolutely-no-one/">Echard and Susie Evans announced their decision</a> to go their separate ways. </p>



<p>The former couple met on Clayton&#8217;s season of The Bachelor and lived together for just under a year before trying long distance and eventually parting ways.</p>



<p>&#8220;With incredibly heavy hearts, we wanted to share that we have decided to go our separate ways,” Echard and Evans wrote in a joint Instagram statement at the time. </p>



<p>“For anyone who has ever loved, knows this was a painful decision to make and not one taken lightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for this lawsuit?</p>



<p>Echard called it &#8220;baseless&#8221; when speaking to The Sun, adding: &#8220;We did not have sexual intercourse.”</p>



<p>Echard also told this outlet that he plans to countersue the woman, whom he believes is “harassing” him because she is “obsessed” with trying to date him.</p>

<p>Clayton Echard did not find true love on The Bachelor.</p>



<p>But the former lead of this ABC franchise now facing a legal battle for having allegedly <em>made</em> love to someone after his time at the center of this show.</p>



<p>Back on August 1, Echard was hit with a lawsuit by an unnamed podcaster who hails from Arizona and who claims in court documents that she and the 33-year old slept together on May 20.</p>



<p>This woman says she is pregnant with twins&#8230; they are due in February&#8230; and Echard is the biological father.</p>

<p>The woman added that she &#8220;hadn&#8217;t been with anyone since March of 2022&#8221; and that Echard broke things off the morning after their supposed night together.</p>



<p>According to The Sun, she says she sent Echard copies of her pregnancy results, stating that he didn&#8217;t believe her and said they only had <em>oral</em> sex.</p>



<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean Echard has done anything wrong in this instance &#8212; but he wasn&#8217;t exactly the most popular Bachelor.</p>



<p>He was trashed last spring for having screwed over finalists Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey&#8230; prior to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/clayton-echard-makes-history-in-most-scripted-ridiculous-nauseat/">asking Susie Evans out on a totally ridiculous finale</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clayton Echard and Susie Evans didn&#8217;t last as a couple, to no one&#8217;s surprise.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/clayton-echard-and-susie-evans-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-absolutely-no-one/">Evans and Echard split just a few months later.</a></p>



<p>Clayton later thanked Susie, however, for saving him during an extremely low point in his life, even saying that he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clayton-echard-reveals-suicidal-thoughts-says-susie-evans-saved-me/">once had suicidal thoughts</a>.</p>



<p>As for this lawsuit, meanwhile?</p>



<p>The accuser included with it “erratic, illogical and threatening messages&#8221; from Echard, along with screenshots of texts he reportedly sent her.</p>



<p>These messages included comments like, “I don’t believe you for a second,” “I legitimately hate you right now,” “You have lost your mind and I hope YOU think about how terrible this is that you would subject me to this” and “My personal hell would be having to have you be a part of my life.” </p>

<p>The woman writes in her lawsuit that she &#8220;offered more than 50 times in writing&#8221; for Echard to take a paternity test. </p>



<p>They allegedly scheduled an appointment for Augugst 23, which she said she paid a $725 deposit for, yet that she says it was cancelled due to Echard&#8217;s &#8220;unwillingness to participate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another one of Clayton&#8217;s alleged messages to her read as follows: </p>



<p>“I would like for you to get an abortion (if you are pregnant with my child, which I still don’t believe, but it doesn’t really matter either way). If you do not, that’s your choice. </p>



<p>&#8220;Then, in that case, if it ends up being my child, I have decided that either you’ll take 100% custody of the child, or it will be put up for adoption. I will not be raising it in any capacity.”</p>

<p>Page Six reports that the reality star has agreed to take a paternity test on September 26, two days before both parties are due in court for an early resolution conference.</p>



<p>&#8220;My response is in the court documents,&#8221; Echard told The Sun this week, referencing his August 21 petition. &#8220;I&#8217;m not giving it the time of day because it&#8217;s baseless. We did not have sexual intercourse.&#8221;</p>



<p>Echard also told this outlet that he plans to sue the woman, whom he believes is “harassing” him because she is “obsessed” with trying to date him.</p>

<p>As the pair made clear in a joint statement a few weeks ago, Clayton Echard and Susie Evans will not be spending the rest of their lives together.</p>



<p>Following a challenging journey on the latest season of The Bachelor, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/clayton-echard-and-susie-evans-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-absolutely-no-one/">Echard and Evans announced their split</a> in late September.</p>



<p>In a recent podcast appearance, however, Echard got real, raw and personal, telling listeners that Evans actually <em>saved</em> his life just a few months ago.</p>



<p>At one point, he considered suicide.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I had no business being the Bachelor with the person that I was then,&#8221; Clayton admitted on Tuesday while a guest on the Off the Vine podcast, adding in a bit more detail:</p>



<p>&#8220;The person I was now would have handled things 100 times better.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is likely a reference to the way Echard earned a great deal of backlash after sleeping with Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia&#8230; only to them dump both women at the same time once he learned he still had a shot with Evans.</p>



<p>Gabby and Rachel were later named co-leads on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a>, while Echard and Evans agreed to start dating after cameras stopped rolling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>During this podcast appearance, Clayton delved into the criticism that came his way after his run as The Bachelor &#8212; and how it seriously messed with his head.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was trying to figure out what my next step was [and] I started questioning who I was because of all the negativity,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clayton-echard-breaks-silence-on-susie-evans-split-treacherous-cheating-scandal/">Clayton explained on air</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;I started to believe some of what was being said about me.</p>



<p>“And I now look back at it and realize, like, I couldn’t be that stable, secure man that I needed to be to really be able to give my all in a relationship.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It sounds as if Echard really has been struggling and, as a result, simply could not hold up his end of a serious relationship.</p>



<p>Thankfully, he and Susie remain on strong terms.</p>



<p>And, thankfully, Evans was there for Clayton when he needed her the most.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Susie and Clayton during their time on The Bachelor.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I do think it all happens for a reason,&#8221; he continued on the podcast. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think I wouldn’t have been able to get through what I got through with anybody other than Susie. She was the only person that was going to help me see what I saw. </p>



<p>&#8220;And she was the only person that was going to keep me from going off the rails and doing something extremely drastic because I had very dark thoughts from the show — moments where I said, you know, ‘It’d be better off if I just ended things.’ </p>



<p>&#8220;And the fact that I had her with me as I was thinking that — I’m like, ‘What if I didn’t have her?’ You know, ‘Where would I have been then?’&#8221;</p>

<p>Wow, huh?</p>



<p>You never really know what someone is going through, do you?</p>



<p>As for whether or not Clayton could see himself trying again with Evans?</p>



<p>“We’re not going to say there’s not the possibility,&#8221; he said this week. </p>



<p>&#8220;But there’s still a lot of pain that came from the entire situation itself that, I think, we can both say we are kind of far off from healing from right now.</p>



<p>&#8220;We need more time. I don’t know if that’s three, six months, a year, two years, whatever, but like, the damage is still too fresh.”</p>

<p>Clayton Echard has a lot to say, you guys.</p>



<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/clayton-echard-and-susie-evans-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-absolutely-no-one/">former Bachelor split from his chosen winner</a>, Susie Evans, releasing a joint statement along with his ex that made it sound as if the break-up was quite amicable.</p>



<p>“We understand that there will likely be a lot of questions about this decision — social media is definitely a highlight reel and much of our experiences together we have kept private as I’m sure most can understand,&#8221; it read. </p>



<p>&#8220;But we will share this — although this last year together has brought us so much joy and so many laughs, there has also been a significant amount of pain.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Susie Evans and Clayton Echard met and fell sort of in love on The Bachelor. Alas, their romance has come to an end.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just a month prior to this announcement, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/clayton-echard-and-susie-evans-were-living-apart-but-staying-together/">Clayton and Susie announced they were gonna try</a> a long-distance relationship, which wasn&#8217;t exactly a positive sign for their future.</p>



<p>Where did things go wrong?</p>



<p>&#8220;There was so many factors at play. This wasn’t a traditional relationship,&#8221; the season 26 Bachelor began while a gust on the Off the Vine podcast on Tuesday, October 4.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was a relationship that was broadcast on national television. </p>



<p>&#8220;There was so many moving parts. … I wasn’t really sure of what my next step was going to be once the show ended.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Clayton continued on this topic: </p>



<p>“I had uprooted myself, I had sold my place. I was like, ‘OK, I can go wherever.’ But as far as what I ended up doing — am I going to go back to corporate America? Or am I going to chase my passions? </p>



<p>&#8220;There were all these unknowns. And I think it put me in a place of instability. </p>



<p>&#8220;Plus, with the backlash from the show, it became very overwhelming, very quickly. </p>



<p>&#8220;And so, what I think ended up happening is I was trying to figure out what my next step was [and] I started questioning who I was because of all the negativity. I started to believe some of what was being said about me. </p>



<p>&#8220;And I now look back at it and realize, like, I couldn’t be that stable, secure man that I needed to be to really be able to give my all in a relationship.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Ah, yes, the backlash.</p>



<p>Echard selected Evans after he thought she had left the show.</p>



<p>Once he learned Susie was still in town on his season finale, Clayton immediately sent both Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey packing (after sleeping with both women) and made a last-desperate plea to Evans.</p>



<p>It worked, and the pair decided to just date for awhile after shooting ended.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Clayton said the break-up is &#8220;sad&#8221; and he wishes he could have been a better &#8220;communicator,&#8221; adding that he lost his “identity” and was trying “so hard to heal&#8221; in the face of criticism from ABC viewers.</p>



<p>And then, of course, there was that cheating scandal.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/clayton-echard-trashes-ridiculous-cheating-accusations-provides/">Echard was accused in April of sleeping around</a>, an allegation he STRONGLY denied.</p>



<p>“People that make these false accusations should be held accountable,” the former football player wrote in a caption on Instagram, adding of the woman who made the claim: </p>



<p>“Trying to gain clout by ruining a relationship is embarrassing and extremely immature.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>On the podcast Tuesday, he addressed this controversy and said:</p>



<p>“The cheating scandal — that was treacherous to our relationship. That really hurt us because it was just one more thing that piled on. </p>



<p>&#8220;And I think if you took any of these things and you just isolated them, I think we would have gotten through it with flying colors. </p>



<p>&#8220;But it was just one thing after the next and then [The Bachelorette] came on. And then it was like, you know, ‘Clayton sucks.’ … That hurts, those comments. </p>



<p>&#8220;Because what that does is that then brings the focus back on to us. And then people online are like, ‘Yeah, he does suck.’”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Despite all of these hiccups and obstacles, could Clayton ever see himself getting back together with Evans?</p>



<p>“We’re not going to say there&#8217;s not the possibility.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s still a lot of pain that came from the entire situation itself that, I think, we can both say we are kind of far off from healing from right now,” he said. </p>



<p>“We need more time. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s three, six months, a year, two years, whatever, but like, the damage is still too fresh.”</p>

<p>In news that should not come as a surprise to anyone that has followed The Bachelor or The Bachelorette for almost any period of time, Clayton Echard and Susie Evans have broken up.</p>



<p>The development just about a month after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/clayton-echard-and-susie-evans-were-living-apart-but-staying-together/">Echard confirmed the pair were gonna try</a> a long distance relationship.</p>



<p>At least for now, things sound pretty amicable at least.</p>



<p>Clayton and Susie used a joint Instagram statement to update their fans and followers on Friday evening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;With incredibly heavy hearts, we wanted to share that we have decided to go our separate ways,&#8221; reads the message.</p>



<p>&#8220;For anyone who has ever loved, knows this was a painful decision to make and not one taken lightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;We understand that there will likely be a lot of questions about this decision — social media is definitely a highlight reel and much of our experiences together we have kept private as I&#8217;m sure most can understand. </p>



<p>&#8220;But we will share this — although this last year together has brought us so much joy and so many laughs, there has also been a significant amount of pain.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Echard starred on the most recent season of The Bachelor.</p>



<p>He scored Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia (who went on to become co-leads of The Bachelorette) after he learned on the season finale that he still has a chance with Evans.</p>



<p>The two did not get engaged to close out the season, however.</p>



<p>They merely agreed to date.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Will Susie Evans and Clayton Echard make it down the aisle? Let&#8217;s just say this: The odds are STRONGLY against them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In their break-up confirmation, the pair continued:</p>



<p>&#8220;We know no healthy relationship comes without its struggles, but we&#8217;ve realized that we were not prepared for the external forces that hindered our ability to not only heal as individuals but also as a couple.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exes added they are &#8220;focused on continuing to work on ourselves, so we can be the best version of ourselves&#8221; going forward.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>At one point, Clayton had to shoot down <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/clayton-echard-trashes-ridiculous-cheating-accusations-provides/">rumors that he cheated on Evans</a>.</p>



<p>But it doesn&#8217;t sound like any such accusations are to blame for this official split.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not an easy time for either of us but we stand in support of each other and hope to see the other go on to find happiness and healing,&#8221; the reality stars explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;Although Claysie is no more, we hope that our communities can support us individually as we move forward with love and respect for each other.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Say what you want about Clayton Echard, but the guy is shredded. Look at all those muscles!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Concluding the post, the pair wrote: </p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you to all of you that supported our relationship. It means so much more than you will ever know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Evans initially said no to a romance with Echard, but the stars subsequently appeared together on the After the Final Rose special and revealed what had transpired between them.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really think it was gonna happen,&#8221; Clayton said at the time of winning over Evans. </p>



<p>&#8220;Especially after the way that we ended things. I just held on to hope. But when she gave me that closure, in that moment, I felt that it was the right thing to do. </p>



<p>&#8220;And thankfully, she reached back out and I just wanted one conversation at a time we just rebuilt that we could.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Clayton Echard smiles here on the set of The Bachelor in early 2020.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In early April, a woman on TikTok claimed she was intimate with Echard while he was in a relationship with Evans. </p>



<p>He trashed the speculation in response.</p>



<p>&#8220;People that make these false accusations should be held accountable,&#8221; Clayton fired back this spring. </p>



<p>&#8220;Trying to gain clout by ruining a relationship is embarrassing and extremely immature.&#8221;He trashed the speculation on Instagram.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Clayton Echard and Susie Evans have taken a major step in their relationship.</p>



<p>But is it a step in a positive direction?</p>



<p>The former Bachelor, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/clayton-echard-makes-history-in-most-scripted-ridiculous-nauseat/">got together with Evans on the ridiculous finale</a> of his polarizing season, made a surprising announcement this week:</p>



<p>The couple is separating &#8212; literally!</p>



<p>H</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Clayton and Susie Evans are doing their best to make their relationship work&#8230; even if that means they must date from a long distance.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Following their run as stars of the aforementioned franchise, Echard and Evans moved in together in Virginia Beach.</p>



<p>Now, however?</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re like, &#8216;We don’t know if it’s going to be a month-long [relationship] from here or if it’s gonna be lifetime but, like, there’s no pressure. </p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s just love each other and be thankful,’” the 29-year-old said on Wednesday on Dear Media’s “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Will Susie Evans and Clayton Echard make it down the aisle? Let&#8217;s just say this: The odds are STRONGLY against them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Added Clayton:</p>



<p>“We’re very, very happy right now and in a really great spot, but yeah, we went through it — together, though.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thankfully, she’s been on my side and that’s the only reason why I can sit here with so much positivity is because of her.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that, Echard explained that he’s moving back to Scottsdale, Arizona&#8230; while Evans spends time in Los Angeles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Currently, we are in Virginia Beach, but our next step actually is, I’m moving to Scottsdale, and she’s going to move in the interim to L.A.,&#8221; Echard continued on this podcast. </p>



<p>&#8220;Only a 50-minute flight apart, but we’re both chasing our dreams, and I think location-wise, we both feel that those are the spots that we want to be.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, I’m working on my computer 10, 12 hours a day. So she was like, ‘Clayton, I’ll move to L.A. and then we can travel on the weekends to see each other.’ </p>



<p>&#8220;And we’ll see. We don’t know if we’re going to like that long-distance.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Echard and Evans agreed only to date (as opposed to getting engaged) on the aforementioned finale.</p>



<p>The decision came after Susie allegedly left the show, prompting Clayton to sleep with both Rachel and Gabby in the Fantasy Suite&#8230; only for Echard to make a last-second ditch to be with Susie after learning she was still in town.</p>



<p>He dumped Gabby and Rachel simultaneously as a result, leading to scorn from many viewers &#8212; and leading to ABC casting both women as The Bachelorette.</p>



<p>Susie and Clayton have since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/susie-evans-and-clayton-echard-root-for-our-romance-please/">tried to ask fans for some support</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Susie Evans and Clayton Echard have clearly gone all the way. Just look at the two of them here in bed.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the podcast this week, Clayton insisted that he and Evans are staying together as a couple. They&#8217;re just trying a new arrangement.</p>



<p>&#8220;A little distance never hurts,&#8221; he said, making what we&#8217;re pretty sure is a troubling statement for any twosome hoping to build a life together.</p>



<p>Echard added that Evans, a wedding photographer and videographer, recently traveled for work and when she returned, they “haven’t been able to keep our hands off each other,&#8221; noting:</p>



<p>&#8220;Distance makes the heart grow fonder.</p>



<p>&#8220;She has her own dreams and aspirations. And we’re gonna give it a shot&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8221; If it doesn’t work, and we’re like, ‘We don’t like this distance, it’s hurting us,’ then one of us will move to the other person.'&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>In this same interview, Clayton touched on a season of The Bachelorette which has often featured some shade hurled in his direction.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hold a grudge. I&#8217;m not mad at anybody for saying something night one,” he said of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a> Season 19 suitors poking fun at him. </p>



<p>“It’s just business, you know, the show is meant to be entertaining and to stir up drama and get people talking. So they&#8217;re going to do that. </p>



<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t mean that these people that are doing this hate me, it just means it&#8217;s a business. It doesn&#8217;t bother me. I&#8217;m happy with my life. But I mean, I guess a silver lining, [was] a lot of people came to my defense online. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was kind of nice just to see people say like, ‘You know, just leave him alone.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Clayton Echard was not the most popular Bachelor in the history of the franchise.</p>



<p>But while he might have earned a few enemies along the way, Clayton wound up finding love in the end.</p>



<p>The franchise hasn&#8217;t had the greatest track record in terms of building lasting relationships in recent years.</p>



<p>But fans are optimistic about Clayton and Susie&#8217;s chances of making it to the altar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Clayton Echard and Susie Evans enjoy a night on the town. (Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>And Clayton&#8217;s latest post is sure to leave the shippers even more hopeful that wedding bells are in the near future for these two.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Echard shared a photo of a love letter that he received from Evans.</p>



<p>And the post had fans swooning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Clayton shared a very personal letter that he received from Susie. (Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Feeling very appreciative right now. To say I&#8217;m blessed is an understatement. Everybody needs a Suse in their life! Love you Snoozie,&#8221; Clayton captioned the post.</p>



<p>&#8220;Clay baby, I love you very much and I felt truly sad this morning knowing we won&#8217;t have time to cuddle or play the next couple of days,&#8221; Susie wrote in her heartfelt letter.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope you know how much you mean to me and how much you&#8217;ve truly impacted my life in a positive way,&#8221; Evans continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Susie and Clayton during their time on The Bachelor. (ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for fighting for us. Thank you for always evolving to help me feel loved,&#8221; she continued, before teasing, &#8220;Thank you for always loving me — even though I&#8217;m weird af boi,&#8221; Susie joked.</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean the world to me, and I know I&#8217;m going to miss you like crazy this weekend. I&#8217;ll pray for us at night and send you all my good energy! I love you more than all the chipotle bowls in the world. Love, Susie.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their path to happiness might have been a little rocky, but it looks like these two wouldn&#8217;t change a thing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Clayton and Susie are one heck of a happy couple. (ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As you&#8217;ll probably recall, Clayton confessed to being in love with three women toward the end of his season.</p>



<p>This led Susie to self-eliminate from the competition, which in turn, prompted Clayton to dump Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia.</p>



<p>That wasn&#8217;t a very popular decision, but it wound up working out for everyone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Clayton narrowed his aspiring wives on The Bachelor Season 26 to Gabby, Rachel and Susie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/gabby-windey-and-rachel-recchia-clap-back-at-critics-being-co-leads-is-fun/">Gabby and Rachel became the first co-leads in <em>Bachelorette</em> histor</a>y, and fans are loving their chemistry on the current season.</p>



<p>As for Clayton and Susie, these two might be the couple that finally snaps the franchise&#8217;s long losing streak.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t want to jinx them by predicting they&#8217;ll make it to the altar in the very near future.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Susie Evans and Clayton Echard have clearly gone all the way. Just look at the two of them here in bed.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But there&#8217;s certainly reason to be hopeful!</p>



<p>With any luck, Clayton and Susie will be writing love letters to one another far into the future.</p>



<p>And maybe they can get Clayton&#8217;s lookalike Jesse Palmer to officiate the wedding!</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the thing, Clayton himself now admits:</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t exactly love being The Bachelor, either!</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Echard shared the following photo of himself on Instagram, explaining to followers that it was snapped by Susie Evans one day before the pair filmed ABC&#8217;s After the Final Rose special.</p>
<p>&quot;In this moment, I was at rock bottom,&quot; the reality star captioned the snapshot.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew what was coming and realized my reality was much further from what I had ever expected. As I looked out the window, I questioned who I was? What had I become?</p>
<p>&quot;Where did everything go wrong? Why me?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Echard came under extreme fire as The Bachelor.</p>
<p>He told two women (Gabby and Rachel) that he loved them, slept with each in the Fantasy Suite&#8230; and then dumped them both simultaneously after he learned he still has a chance with Evans.</p>
<p>Susie actually turned down Clayton&#8217;s advances on the season finale, only to get back in touch with him weeks after shooting concluded.</p>
<p>On the aforementioned special, <a href="/2022/03/susie-evans-and-clayton-echard-root-for-our-romance-please/">Evans and Echard revealed to the world</a> that they&#8217;re seriously dating, with plans to live together.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Continued Echard in his emotional post:</p>
<p>&quot;6 months prior, I was standing outside as the first limo pulled up and kept thinking to myself how I was so lucky to be in this position as The Bachelor.</p>
<p>&quot;6 months later, I was staring out this window wondering how much worse things could get.</p>
<p>&quot;But as I&#8217;ve reflected back on it all now since being out of the spotlight, I&#8217;ve had the ability to see what I couldn&#8217;t see before.</p>
<p>&quot;I was too busy trying to defend my actions and my character, instead of accepting full responsibility for not only what I had done, but for who all I hurt.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Throughout the season, Echard faced harsh criticism from viewers and even from his contestants for some of the decisions he made&#8230; including keeping Shanae Ankney around after numerous suitors told him about how she acted when he wasn&rsquo;t around.</p>
<p>On the After the Final Rose episode, Gabby accused Echard of &ldquo;clearly pitting&rdquo; the women against each other, while Rachel said she thought he told her that he loved her just so she would sleep with him.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain if that&#8217;s accurate or not.</p>
<p>But Clayton now admits that he messed up. Big time. On multiple occasions.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I feel that I finally have learned my lesson,&quot; he wrote on Monday, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I hurt people. Sure, I didn&#8217;t have any intention of doing so and &#8216;did what I thought was best by following my heart,&#8217; but I still hurt people.</p>
<p>&quot;Perception is reality and regardless of intention, the results of our actions hold the most weight.</p>
<p>&quot;So, through therapy and other means of self-reflection, I have been able to finally see the reality of what all I had done.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Added Clayton, who recently shot down <a href="/2022/04/clayton-echard-trashes-ridiculous-cheating-accusations-provides/">rumors that he cheated on Evans</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;I never forget to give myself grace, as we all should do for ourselves. But I am a work in progress and always will be.</p>
<p>&quot;Because perfection is impossible to obtain, but we can all be better than we were the day before. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll continue to strive to do.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The forrmer football player concluded as follows, thanking his fans and writing:</p>
<p><em>Without you all and your support and constructive criticism, I would still be focused on defending my character, instead of building upon it.</em></p>
<p><em>I would still be coming up with explanations that fit my narrative, instead of working to understand &quot;the other side.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>And I would still be looking out that window, wondering who I really am. But I now know &hellip; and for that, I am finally at peace.</em></p>
