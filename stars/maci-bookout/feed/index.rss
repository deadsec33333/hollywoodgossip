<p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/mackenzie-standifer-demands-longer-sentence-for-ryan-edwards-as-teen-mom-stars-connections-to-judge-are-exposed/">Ryan Edwards was arrested</a> and sentenced to one year in prison for stalking and harassing his estranged wife (while on probation, no less).</p>



<p>During one of his infamous benders, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-destroys-wifes-home-scrawls-death-threats-all-over-the-walls/">Ryan broke into the house he used to share with Mackenzie Standifer</a> and trashed the place so badly that she and her kids were forced to relocate.</p>



<p>Given the nature of his crimes &#8212; and the length of his rap sheet &#8212; it was widely assumed that Ryan would finally do some real time behind bars.</p>



<p>So many <em>Teen Mom</em> fans were surprised to see that the troubled former reality star hit the links with his teenage son over the weekend.</p>

<p>How is this possible?</p>



<p>Well, last month, a judge took pity on Ryan in the hope of saving his life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/">Edwards was furloughed so that he could check into rehab</a> for four weeks of intensive addiction treatment.</p>



<p>When he returned to court for a progress report, the same judge decided that instead of going back to jail, Ryan would be allowed to move into a sober living house where he would be free to come and go as he pleased &#8212; within reason.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-1024x576.png" alt="Ryan Edwards Harbors a Lot of Resentment" class="wp-image-409087" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-harbors-a-lot-of-resentment.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan consumed many beverages on camera during his years as an MTV star.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>These days, Ryan has a curfew, and he&#8217;s subjected to daily drug tests, but as long as he stays clean and follows the rules of the house, he&#8217;s permitted to live the life of a semi-free man.</p>



<p>So it was that Ryan was able to join his father, Larry, his son, Bentley, and Bentley&#8217;s stepfather, Taylor McKinney, on a golf outing over the weekend.</p>



<p>A photo of the foursome was shared by Bentley, who captioned the pic, &#8220;Family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, this is a milestone moment for Ryan, and not only because this might be his longest stretch of sobriety.</p>

But that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>For years, Ryan seemed to be fighting for the title of Worst Dad in the History of the Teen Mom Franchise.</p>



<p>These days, however, the 35-year-old appears to be making a real effort to improve his relationship with his teenage son.</p>



<p>Throughout most of his time in the spotlight, Ryan was at war with Bentley&#8217;s mother, Maci Bookout.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="642" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-1024x642.png" alt="" class="wp-image-479928" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-1024x642.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-300x188.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-768x481.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-1536x962.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-2048x1283.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout offered some kind words to her ex in this scene from Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But these days, the exes have settled their differences.</p>



<p>In fact, some fans believe <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/maci-bookout-slammed-for-continued-support-of-ryan-edwards-hes-an-abusive-loser/">Bookout has been <em>too</em> supportive of Edwards</a>.</p>



<p>Maci&#8217;s desire to see Ryan get sober and stay out of jail is understandable &#8212; after all, he&#8217;s still the father of her youngest child.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout shares son Bentley with Ryan Edwards, who had next to no contact with his child for several years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But it&#8217;s important to bear in mind that Ryan is guilty of some truly brutal crimes, some of which he committed very recently.</p>



<p>Edwards terrorized Mackenzie and her children, and many observers believe it&#8217;s unfair him to get off with such a light sentence.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s nice that Bentley has his dad back, and all &#8212; but there&#8217;s a strong case to be made that Ryan deserves to be locked up.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ryan-edwards-finishes-rehab-returns-to-courtroom-for-dramatic-hearing/">Ryan Edwards is in rehab</a>, receiving treatment for the drug addiction that nearly claimed his life on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s probably not where Ryan imagined himself at this stage in his life, but things could be much, much worse.</p>



<p>For starters, he could be dead.</p>



<p>After all, the man has overdosed multiple times, most memorably when he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/11/mackenzie-mckee-gushes-about-ryan-edwards-wedding-no-one-passed/">passed out behind the wheel while driving to his own wedding</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is another Ryan Edwards mug shot. We&#8217;ve lost track how many it&#8217;s been now for him.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Another alternative is that Ryan could still be in jail.</p>



<p>A generous judge<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/"> furloughed Edwards&#8217; one-year sentence</a> to allow him to go to rehab and then transfer to the sober living house that now serves as his home.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the guy has been through an awful lot in his relatively young life, but his problems are mostly self-created, and he&#8217;s caused an incredible amount of damage to his loved ones.</p>



<p>Which is one reason so many<em> Teen Mom</em> fans are surprised that Ryan&#8217;s former fiancee Maci Bookout continues to support him.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Ryan and Maci experienced many ups and downs in recent years as they attempted to amicably co-parent their teenage son, Bentley.</p>



<p>But these days, despite all that she&#8217;s endured, Maci is 100 percent Team Ryan.</p>



<p>And some of her fans are seriously questioning her decision to support and endorse such a toxic dude.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Maci needs to complete[ly] disconnect from Ryan,” one Instagram commenter wrote this week, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/08/21/teen-mom-the-next-chapter-cast-members-commend-maci-bookout-for-supporting-troubled-ex-ryan-edwards-while-some-viewers-urge-maci-to-completely-disconnect-from-ryan-altogether/">according to</a> The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup.</p>



<p>“This has to be a joke! The whole entire time she’s been on 99% of the time is about Ryan,” another wrote. “</p>



<p>&#8220;He’s been on the show maybe 30% of the time. Maci needs to focus on her current family and the beauty of having a stepdad that loves her son or struggles,&#8221; this person continued, adding:</p>



<p>“Do all your kids a favor &amp; live your lives OFF camera.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>“Ryan is a menace. He’s a danger to himself and the people who love him,” a third person chimed in.</p>



<p>“I hope Maci keeps her wits about her on this journey of being there for him.”</p>



<p>“Maci acting like Ryan [is] not the problem now that they are on good terms,” a fourth viewer tweeted. </p>

<p>“Ryan is responsible for the relationship he &amp; Bentley had. Did she see how Ryan tore up his &amp; Mack’s home. He pulled a knife on her.”</p>



<p>“Maci went from hating Ryan for every little dumb thing… to worrying about his well-being while he’s trashing his house and getting arrested. Like. What? #TeenMom,” someone else wrote.</p>



<p>“They are literally blaming Mackenzie for everything &amp; acting like she’s the problem,” another person tweeted. </p>



<p>“Ryan KEEPS using drugs &amp; is even telling them that &amp; yet Maci’s like oh well stay away from her and saying how different he is? He’s exactly the same but on an escalated level.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/maci-bookout-to-fans-stop-making-fun-of-ryan-edwards-its-not-his-fault-hes-messed-up/">Maci has shown up to Ryan&#8217;s court dates</a> and posted several memes about the importance of forgiveness and compassion.</p>



<p>Fans might not like it, but she&#8217;s receiving a lot of praise from her <em>Teen Mom </em>co-stars.</p>



<p>“I just wanna say that I commend Maci for just supporting Ryan through it all,” Leah Messer told<em> Us Weekly</em> in a recent interview. </p>



<p>“I know me and [my ex-husband] Corey [Simms] had went through our challenges with that, and it was … difficult.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>“I commend [Maci] and [her husband] Taylor [McKinney] for how they’re handling the whole situation,” Tyler Baltierra echoed.</p>



<p>“I think they’re doing a killer job at this whole parenting thing.”</p>



<p>It likely wasn&#8217;t easy for Maci to do 180 and begin showing support to Ryan.</p>



<p>But if doing so introduces a modicum of increased stability to Bentley&#8217;s life, then we&#8217;re sure it&#8217;ll all be worth it.</p>

<p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-sentenced-to-1-year-in-prison-for-harassing-estranged-wife-mackenzie-standifer/">Ryan Edwards was sentenced to one year in prison</a> for stalking and harassing his estranged wife, Mackenzie Standifer.</p>



<p>At the time, Edwards was already on probation, and when the police eventually found him, he was passed out in his car from an apparent drug overdose. </p>



<p>Needless to say, it looked as though Ryan would be locked up for a very long time.</p>



<p>But when it comes to the criminal justice system, Ryan Edwards is one lucky SOB.</p>

But that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Last month, a judge offered Edwards a furlough so that he could attend a four-week inpatient rehab program.</p>



<p>Earlier this week,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ryan-edwards-finishes-rehab-returns-to-courtroom-for-dramatic-hearing/"> Ryan was back in court for a progress report</a>, and the same judge allowed him to spend the next chunk of his sentence at a sober living house for recovering addicts.</p>



<p>If he successfully completes the program, then Ryan will likely have a good deal of time shaved off his sentence, meaning that he might complete his one-year bid without spending more than a few weeks in actual prison.</p>



<p></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good thing when a judge decides to treat addiction as a medical issue rather than a moral failing, but the fact is, Ryan&#8217;s crimes were pretty brutal.</p>



<p>The guy broke into the house where his wife and kids live and trashed the place so badly that they were forced to relocate.</p>



<p>As a result,<em> Teen Mom</em> fans have been quite vocal in their complaints about Ryan&#8217;s latest slap on the wrist.</p>

<p></p>



<p>But an unexpected supporter has come to his defense.</p>



<p>In recent months, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/maci-bookout-offers-support-to-ryan-edwards-after-learning-he-was-placed-on-suicide-watch-during-recent-lock-up/">Ryan and baby mama Maci Bookout have managed to repair their relationship</a> for the sake of their teenage son, Bentley.</p>



<p>Obviously, Maci wants Ryan to get better for Bentley&#8217;s sake, and so she&#8217;s been supporting his recovery process &#8212; and clapping back at those who wish to see him locked up for good.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="642" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-1024x642.png" alt="" class="wp-image-479928" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-1024x642.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-300x188.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-768x481.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-1536x962.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM-2048x1283.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-20-at-9.29.45-AM.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout offered some kind words to her ex in this scene from Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In her latest pro-Ryan message, Maci never actually mentions her ex by name, but her intention is clear.</p>



<p>“When a flashlight grows dim or quits working, you don’t throw it away, you change the batteries,” she wrote on her Instagram Story. </p>



<p>“When a person messes up and finds themselves in a dark place, do you cast them aside? Of course not. You help them change their batteries.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="735" height="708" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo.png" alt="Ryan Edwards MTV Photo" class="wp-image-408890" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-300x289.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-335x323.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-347x334.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-520x501.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-640x616.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards has had many brushes with the law.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Clearly, that was Maci&#8217;s way of defending Ryan without actually butting heads with any of his haters.</p>



<p>We respect that she wants what&#8217;s best for her son, and this case, that means she wants Ryan to turn his life around.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not hard to see why many of Maci&#8217;s fans might have a very hard time forgiving the guy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>These days,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/"> Ryan Edwards is living in an inpatient rehab facility</a>, having been temporarily released from jail to undergo addiction treatment.</p>



<p>We wish him all the best in his efforts to get clean, but the reality of the situation is that he probably has more jail time coming to him, even if he finally manages to sober up.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/mackenzie-standifer-claps-back-at-trolls-who-say-she-deserved-to-be-abused-by-ryan-edwards/">Ryan stalked and harassed Mackenzie Standifer</a> and went on a drug-fueled bender prior to his latest arrest.</p>



<p>And because Edwards was already on probation when all of this happened, completing the program probably won&#8217;t be enough to make him a free man.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is another Ryan Edwards mug shot. We&#8217;ve lost track how many it&#8217;s been now for him.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But none of that had transpired when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/maci-bookout-offers-support-to-ryan-edwards-after-learning-he-was-placed-on-suicide-watch-during-recent-lock-up/">Ryan filmed a scene with Maci Bookout</a> for this week&#8217;s episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</em></p>



<p>In fact, it looked as though Bentley&#8217;s mom and dad were on the verge of repairing their co-parenting relationship.</p>



<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-answers-to-all-of-your-questions-about-the-worst-baby-daddy-in-teen-mom-history/">every other part of Ryan&#8217;s life </a>was in shambles, a fact he admitted to during the conversation.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Mackenzie is being an absolute pain in my ass. She don&#8217;t know why she left, it&#8217;s been everything under the sun. It&#8217;s because of my addiction, because I was outside in my garage,&#8221; he told Maci.</p>



<p>She responded by advising him to &#8220;keep focusing on you and all these crazy children and stay away from her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not shocking to me. I know when we filmed the reunion and had that conversation about starting fresh with coparenting, she&#8217;s not gonna let this happen, she&#8217;s not,&#8221; Maci later told her husband, Taylor McKinney. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;And then she lost her mind anytime him and Bentley were gonna go do something because she couldn&#8217;t go, because it was supposed to be the two of them.&#8221;&#8216;</p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a little surprising to hear Maci take Ryan&#8217;s side against Mackenzie, but it&#8217;s important to remember that at that time, she was only hearing his side of the story.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do think this has everything to do with Ryan and Bentley&#8217;s relationship growing, me and Ryan trying to work together. I don&#8217;t think she can handle it,&#8221; Bookout continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Bentley is the one that pays for all of this, so we have to stay on the same team. I hope this divorce doesn&#8217;t get messy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Maci added that Bentley was &#8220;kind of shocked&#8221; to learn about his dad&#8217;s divorce, he didn&#8217;t seem &#8220;bothered by it or upset.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s never really been a big fan of Mackenzie&#8217;s,&#8221; she explained.</p>



<p>But despite Maci&#8217;s hope that the Ryan&#8217;s split wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;get messy,&#8221; it quickly did exactly that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan has publicly and repeatedly accused his wife, Mackenzie Standifer, of being unfaithful. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Later in the episode, a <em>Teen Mom </em>producer named Kiki paid a visit to Ryan in order to ask about some shocking allegations made by Mackenzie.</p>



<p>&#8220;She said I f&#8212;ing held a knife to her back or something like that … f&#8212; no, that&#8217;s so dumb,&#8221; he said, denying that he held her at knifepoint. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone knows when I get angry, I get f&#8212;ing angry. So she&#8217;s gonna use that against me. But I ain&#8217;t never put my hands on a woman ever before.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer are headed for divorce court. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ryan has publicly accused Mackenzie of cheating on him on numerous occasions, and it seems he was fixating on the idea at the time of the previous night&#8217;s argument.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, she left this house last night and there was only one reason why she left this house,&#8221; he told Kiki. </p>



<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t lie very well, she&#8217;ll stumble over every word she says and I was like, &#8216;Where the f&#8212; did you stay last night?&#8217; and she couldn&#8217;t come up with a good answer. So I started putting two and two together.&#8221;</p>



<p>He went on to suggest that Mackenzie was jealous of his friendship with Maci.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what kind of pissed Mackenzie off too, like really. I don&#8217;t think she ever wanted us to have a relationship,&#8221; he said, adding that Bentley &#8220;didn&#8217;t like [Mackenzie] anyways.&#8221; </p>



<p>Kiki then asked whether he felt his wife was &#8220;threatened&#8221; by his coparenting relationship, to which he replied:</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I think that really f&#8212;ing sent her over the edge.&#8221;</p>



<p>Eventually, of course, the truth of the confrontation came out:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards is in trouble with the law once again. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an addict, you are getting a divorce, can&#8217;t go back to your house, kids no longer live with you. That is a slippery slope,&#8221; Kiki said, prompting Ryan to blurt out, &#8220;I done f&#8212;ed up, I ain&#8217;t gonna lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>The producer then asked Ryan if he had relapsed amid all of the latest drama, to which he replied, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>So yeah, given that Ryan was on drugs at the time of the incident, and he later came back and trashed the house, we&#8217;re gonna go ahead and believe Mackenzie&#8217;s version of events.</p>



<p>Edwards is due back in court on August 12, at which time a judge will assess his progress and determine his fate.</p>

<p>Maci Bookout has been through plenty of ups and downs in recent years, and most of the drama has involved her troubled baby daddy, Ryan Edwards.</p>



<p>There was some hope that with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-answers-to-all-of-your-questions-about-the-worst-baby-daddy-in-teen-mom-history/">Ryan behind bars</a>, Maci&#8217;s life might begin to settle down a bit, but sadly, it seems she&#8217;s now dealing with a different kind of turmoil.</p>



<p>In promotional materials for the current season of<em> Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>, MTV revealed that Maci was “busy dealing with a medical crisis&#8221; during filming.</p>



<p>Now, details of that crisis have been revealed ahead of Wednesday night&#8217;s episode.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/07/24/more-info-on-maci-bookouts-health-crisis-that-will-be-revealed-on-teen-mom-the-next-chapter/">new report</a> from The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, Maci will reveal on the episode that she believes she&#8217;s experiencing health issues as a result of her breast implants.</p>



<p>This will be the first time that Maci publicly admits to undergoing plastic surgery.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s believed that Bookout went under the knife back in 2011, when she was just 19 years old.</p>

<p></p>



<p>At the time, Maci would have been newly flush with cash from the overnight success of the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise.</p>



<p>Several of the cast members celebrated their newfound wealth by undergoing cosmetic procedures, most notably Farrah Abraham, who dramatically altered her appearance with a series of surgeries.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, Jenelle Evans got breast implants and MTV made the surprising decision to intervene.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-679x1024.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-473776" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-679x1024.webp 679w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-199x300.webp 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-768x1159.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-735x1109.webp 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-222x335.webp 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-230x347.webp 230w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-345x520.webp 345w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-424x640.webp 424w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-509x768.webp 509w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-636x960.webp 636w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936-716x1080.webp 716w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/really-scared-teen-mom-jenelle-810935936.webp 916w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans has complained of numerous health issues during her years in the spotlight.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to The Ashley, <em>Teen Mom</em> producers asked the cast not to undergo any more cosmetic surgeries for a set period of time.</p>



<p>The thinking, it seems, was that the show was controversial enough without all of the cast members blowing their earnings on implants.</p>



<p>But once the employer&#8217;s moratorium was lifted, the surgery trend resumed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout appears to be in deep thought in this photograph of the MTV star.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the years that followed, most of the cast members underwent breast augmentation, and several of the ladies &#8212; including Kail Lowry, Cheyenne Floyd and Briana DeJesus &#8212; even allowed MTV to film their procedures.</p>



<p>Maci was the lone holdout who wouldn&#8217;t discuss her procedure on camera, or even admit to going under the knife.</p>

<p>So the news of her upcoming storyline is rather surprising.</p>



<p>The exact nature of Maci&#8217;s health issue is still unclear, but it seems Bookout is convinced that her implants are the cause of her woes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the implants were initially defective, or it could be that she began to experience a negative reaction because they degraded in some way over the course of 12 years.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, it couldn&#8217;t have been easy for Maci to speak out on this issue after keeping quiet about it for so long.</p>



<p>We applaud her candor, and we look forward to hearing what she has to say.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a longtime <em>Teen Mom</em> fan then you&#8217;re likely aware that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-answers-to-all-of-your-questions-about-the-worst-baby-daddy-in-teen-mom-history/">Ryan Edwards is a deeply troubled man</a>.</p>



<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/">Edwards is in court-ordered rehab</a>, having been furloughed from his current prison sentence by a generous judge who&#8217;s offered Ryan one last chance to get clean.</p>



<p>Edwards was serving a one-year sentence for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/mackenzie-edwards-im-done-with-my-violent-and-effed-up-husband-once-and-for-all/">stalking and harassing his estranged wife, Mackenzie Standifer</a>.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s awaiting trial on a host of other charges, and he could end up behind bars for a very long time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is another Ryan Edwards mug shot. We&#8217;ve lost track how many it&#8217;s been now for him.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But while Mackenzie has understandably distanced herself from Ryan, it seems that Edwards is receiving support from the mother of his eldest child.</p>



<p>Yes, on this week&#8217;s episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>, fans were shocked to see Maci Bookout offering some kind words to a down-and-out Ryan.</p>



<p>The episode was filmed before his latest brush with the law, but based on the fact that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/maci-bookout-supports-ryan-edwards-in-court-troubled-teen-mom-star-to-remain-behind-bars/">Maci showed up in court</a> for one of Ryan&#8217;s recent hearings, it&#8217;s safe to assume that she&#8217;s still on his side.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>“I never imagined we’d be in a place where this would be happening, but time and therapy — it does wonders,” Maci told Ryan during their scene together.</p>



<p>“When you got arrested this last time, they said, ‘He has been on suicide watch.’ Then I was really worried,” she  continued.</p>



<p>“You need to talk to somebody about that.”</p>

But that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“What do you tell somebody?” Ryan asked.</p>



<p>“That you’re struggling,” Maci replied.</p>



<p>“It would be devastating to a lot of people if you weren’t here. I’d rather you be a pain in my ass, and be here, then not,” she quipped, as Ryan laughed but wiped away tears,&#8221; she continued, adding:</p>



<p>“So next time, just call me.”</p>

<p>The scene came on the heels of a surprising interview, in which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/mackenzie-standifer-shocks-fans-by-praising-abusive-convict-ryan-edwards-he-got-closer-to-bentley-while-he-was-in-jail/">Maci revealed that Ryan has become closer to son Bentley</a> in the months since his latest trouble with the law.</p>



<p>“I think as crazy as it is, because he is in jail right now, he shows up and communicates with Bentley, I think, more consistently now than he ever has, which is mind-blowing,” <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/maci-bookout-comforts-ex-ryan-edwards-after-he-was-on-suicide-watch/">she told</a> <em>Us Weekly.</em></p>



<p>“Although Ryan made really bad decisions and is paying the consequences for them, I’m glad to see that that hasn’t stopped him from showing up or, like, calling and communicating because in the past that would’ve halted everything,&#8221; Maci continued.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout shares son Bentley with Ryan Edwards, who has next to no contact with his child.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/ryan-edwards-mtv-fired-me-because-i-love-america-too-much/">Ryan was fired from <em>Teen Mom</em></a><em> </em>at Maci&#8217;s behest back in 2021, but he made a surprising return to the franchise (seemingly with Maci&#8217;s consent) following the launch of <em>Next Chapter</em>.</p>



<p>Obviously, Ryan&#8217;s legal troubles interfered with his filming schedule, but he could be looking at a much lighter sentence if he actually sticks with rehab this time.</p>



<p>Edwards is due back in court on August 12.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Ryan Edwards is a severe drug addict, and all of his recent behavior should be viewed through that lens.</p>



<p>But while his substance abuse issues might help to explain his latest tirade, they certainly don&#8217;t excuse it.</p>



<p>While under the influence, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-destroys-wifes-home-scrawls-death-threats-all-over-the-walls/">Edwards stalked and harassed his estranged wife, Mackenzie Standife</a>r, eventually trashing the couple&#8217;s house so badly that it was no longer livable.</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ryan-edwards-released-from-jail-after-just-3-promptly-shipped-off-to-rehab/">Edwards was released from jail</a> so that he could check into court-ordered rehab.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is another Ryan Edwards mug shot. We&#8217;ve lost track how many it&#8217;s been now for him.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>He&#8217;ll be back in court next month for an evaluation of his progress.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Ryan has few supporters these days, but to the surprise of many fans, one of them is Maci Bookout.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/maci-bookout-supports-ryan-edwards-in-court-troubled-teen-mom-star-to-remain-behind-bars/">Maci was in court for one of Ryan&#8217;s hearings </a>last month, and in a new interview with TooFab, she revealed that Edwards&#8217; recent troubles have actually made him a better father to their teenage son, Bentley.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="776" height="672" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode.png" alt="Maci Bookout on MTV Episode" class="wp-image-356332" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode.png 776w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-300x260.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-768x665.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-735x636.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-335x290.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-347x300.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-520x450.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/maci-bookout-on-mtv-episode-640x554.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout isn&#8217;t sure how to handle Ryan Edwards being the father of her son. We totally get it.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit; MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Obviously with all the crap that went down, and him being in jail now, we’re still in a good place,” Maci told the site (<a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/07/17/maci-bookout-talks-about-communicating-with-ex-ryan-edwards-while-hes-been-in-jail-praises-ryan-for-getting-closer-to-son-bentley-despite-being-behind-bars/">via</a> The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup).</p>



<p>“And, actually, we speak to each other very consistently and often,” Maci added. </p>



<p>“But it’s obviously just different now because it’s not in-person and he’s not out here in the real world. We’re still going in a good direction.”</p>

<p>Maci went on to reveal that she and Ryan basically started from scratch after having no relationship at all for several years.</p>



<p>“I think time definitely helped but us being able to genuinely have a conversation and make commitments to each other as far as what our role is to make a better relationship, and really start a relationship because we haven’t had one in so long,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>In a separate interview with <em>Us Weekly</em>, Maci revealed that she believes Ryan is ready to bounce back after hitting rock bottom.</p>

<p>“I think as crazy as it is, because he is in jail right now, he shows up and communicates with Bentley, I think, more consistently now than he ever has, which is mind-blowing,” she told the outlet.</p>



<p>“Although Ryan made really bad decisions and is paying the consequences for them, I’m glad to see that that hasn’t stopped him from showing up or, like, calling and communicating because in the past that would’ve halted everything,” Maci added.</p>



<p>She went on to say that her son is sadly accustomed to seeing his father in various lowly states.</p>

<p>“With Bentley being older and unfortunately this not being the first time that something has happened [with Ryan], Bentley and I have always had an extremely close relationship, but also a very open and honest relationship,” she said. </p>



<p>“So for us I think just being straightforward and, ‘Here’s what’s going on,’ and then really just making sure that Bentley knows that we’re there for him and if needs anything or has questions or wants to talk about how to deal with something, just being there to support him through it.”</p>



<p>Maci went on to reveal that Ryan struggled mightily during his most recent lockup, but she believes that the worst is behind him.</p>



<p>“[Ryan had] rough patches just dealing with mental health [issues]… it’s a crazy world on the inside,” Maci said.</p>

<p>“At the same time, it’s like, yeah, but don’t do stupid sh-t,” she continued.</p>



<p>“Yes, I will always be afraid that there’s that chance that it’s gonna be a disaster. But I think at the same time I’m just, like, I know what I can do and what I can’t do and … that’s all I can do, and I’m confident in that.”</p>



<p>We wish both Ryan and Maci all the best as they move forward and attempt to rebuild.</p>

<p>For the past several years, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/teen-mom-ratings-hit-record-low-as-fans-turn-against-boring-franchise/">ratings have been declining across the Teen Mom universe</a>.</p>



<p>Multiple spinoffs have been canceled, and there were fears among the fans that the entire franchise would be kicked to the curb.</p>



<p>But against all odds, <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> is returning for at least one more season.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;ve got the trailer to prove it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="New Episodes, New Night!  🚨 Teen Mom: The Next Chapter – First Look Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eotveEnd4XM?start=4&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s an eventful season for the moms &#8212; or at least the trailer has been cleverly edited to create the appearance of an eventful season.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it&#8217;s sure to be a memorable one for Jade Cline, who&#8217;s in the process of planning her wedding to Sean Austin</p>



<p>“I’m in full wedding-planning mode,” Jade says while trying on wedding dresses. </p>

<p></p>



<p>“I’ve never done this before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly Jade is living her best life, but not everyone is on top of the world in this new season.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/catelynn-lowell-and-tyler-baltierra-reunite-with-daughter-carly-share-extremely-rare-photo/">Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra have been spending a lot time with their teenage daughter Carly</a> in recent weeks, but during filming, they were clearly mourning her absence from their lives.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry that we didn’t get to parent her,” a tearful Tyler tells Catelynn in the trailer.</p>



<p>Catelynn and Tyler put Carly up for adoption when she was born, but they&#8217;ve maintained close ties with her adoptive parents.</p>



<p>While we likely won&#8217;t see Carly on camera, it seems that fans <em>will</em> get an update on where Tyler and Cate stand with their first born.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the trailer, we see Briana informing her mom, Roxanne, that baby daddy Devoin was “hitting on” her.</p>



<p>We also see her give Devoin a lap dance, so it seems the feelings are mutual.</p>



<p>And in what might be the most exciting development of all, we get our first glimpse at the not-so-triumphant of Maci Bookout&#8217;s loser ex Ryan Edwards.</p>

<p></p>



<p>These days,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/maci-bookout-supports-ryan-edwards-in-court-troubled-teen-mom-star-to-remain-behind-bars/"> Ryan is in prison</a>, and it doesn&#8217;t look like he&#8217;ll be getting out anytime soon.</p>



<p>But he rejoined the cast of TMTNC before getting locked away, and it seems he&#8217;ll be playing a fairly sizable role in the upcoming season.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ryan filmed before and after rehab and before going to jail so he will be in a lot. Same with his parents. Mack [Standifer] not at all, from what I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/06/27/mtv-finally-sets-premiere-date-for-teen-mom-the-next-chapter-season-1b-watch-the-first-trailer/">tweeted</a> this week in response to a fan&#8217;s question.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="483" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-1024x483.png" alt="" class="wp-image-478595" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-1024x483.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-300x141.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-768x362.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-1536x724.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-2048x966.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-735x347.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-335x158.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-347x164.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-520x245.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-640x302.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-960x453.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-28-at-3.15.48-PM-1080x509.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cast of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Next Chapter </em>features scenes in which the entire cast gets together, so maybe we&#8217;ll get to see the other moms bash Ryan on Maci&#8217;s behalf.</p>



<p>Sadly, Mackenzie Standifer won&#8217;t be on hand to watch her estranged husband receive the roasting he so richly deserves.</p>



<p><em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> returns to MTV on Wednesday, July 19.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Ryan Edwards has put Maci Bookout through hell in recent years &#8212; as he has with just about everyone in his life.</p>



<p>But as much as she might prefer to cut ties with her troubled ex entirely, Maci still has a kid with Ryan, and that kid wants to have a relationship with his dad.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-seen-fighting-with-cops-in-shocking-new-arrest-video/">Ryan is currently in jail</a>, having been arrested several times in the first few months of 2023 (and many, many more times prior to this year).</p>



<p>He appeared in court on Tuesday to be arraigned on four new charges, and Maci was there to show her support.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is another Ryan Edwards mug shot. We&#8217;ve lost track how many it&#8217;s been now for him.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hamilton County Sheriff)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Ryan will soon stand trial for violating his probation and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/mackenzie-standifer-demands-longer-sentence-for-ryan-edwards-as-teen-mom-stars-connections-to-judge-are-exposed/">harassing his estranged wife, Mackenzie Standifer</a>.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s also been charged with one count of possession of a controlled substance and one count of DUI.</p>



<p>The latter two charges stem from an incident that took place in April, when Ryan overdosed and was found by police, passed out in his running car.</p>



<p>Asked why she decided to attend the hearing, Maci replied that she did so with her son&#8217;s best interests in mind.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maci Bookout is extremely close with her eldest child, Bentley. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“As Bentley’s mom it was important for me to show up for not only Ryan, but Bentley as well,&#8221; <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-maci-bookout-attends-ex-ryan-edwards-court-hearing-ryans-mom-rehab-rep-testify-heres-what-went-down/">Bookout told</a> The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup.</p>



<p>Also in attendance were Ryan&#8217;s parents, Jen and Larry Edwards, both of whom made regular appearances during Ryan&#8217;s years on Teen Mom.</p>



<p>Jen took the stand to address the court on her son&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p></p>



<p>A worker from CADAS, a Chattanooga rehab center where Ryan once sought treatment, also served as a character witness.</p>



<p>“The CADAS rep asked for a furlough for Ryan to go to the rehab when it has a bed available,” a courtroom witness tells The Ashley. </p>



<p>“They also want him to begin Vivitrol shots within two weeks of him arriving at the rehab.”</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="847" height="645" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo.jpg" alt="Ryan Edwards Teen Mom Photo" class="wp-image-402601" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo.jpg 847w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-768x585.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-735x560.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-335x255.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-347x264.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-520x396.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-photo-640x487.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards is bugging out about something in this photo. It&#8217;s from an episode of Teen Mom.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Vivitrol is an intravenous anti-addiction medication meant to curb cravings in patients who are detoxing from alcohol, opioids, and other drugs.</p>



<p>Clearly, the rehab staffer is of the opinion that Ryan will no longer be a threat to himself or others if he&#8217;s able to kick the addictions that have plagued him throughout his adult life.</p>



<p>But it might be hard to convince a judge of that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="745" height="687" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom.png" alt="Edwards, Ryan (Teen Mom)" class="wp-image-398846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom.png 745w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom-300x277.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom-735x678.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom-335x309.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom-347x320.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom-520x480.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/edwards-ryan-teen-mom-640x590.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards of Teen Mom OG fame. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>After all, Ryan has been arrested more than a dozen times, and he&#8217;s checked into treatment centers on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>Edwards was ordered to rehab by a judge earlier this year, but he bailed on the treatment program after just a few days.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s unlikely that Ryan will be given a second chance at the rehab option.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="735" height="708" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo.png" alt="Ryan Edwards MTV Photo" class="wp-image-408890" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-300x289.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-335x323.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-347x334.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-520x501.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ryan-edwards-mtv-photo-640x616.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards has had many brushes with the law.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Even if the judge were in a particularly forgiving mood,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-sentenced-to-1-year-in-prison-for-harassing-estranged-wife-mackenzie-standifer/"> Edwards has already been sentenced to a year in jail</a> for trashing the house where he used to live with Mackenzie.</p>



<p>He&#8217;ll likely be forced to complete that sentence before any other options can be considered.</p>



<p>And then there&#8217;s the matter of the many other crimes he&#8217;s been charged with &#8230;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Maci Bookout has something to say in the wake of her ex-boyfriend getting sent to prison.</p>



<p>Sort of, that is.</p>



<p>Kind of, we&#8217;d say.</p>



<p>In indirect fashion, really.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-sentenced-to-1-year-in-prison-for-harassing-estranged-wife-mackenzie-standifer/">Ryan Edwards was sentenced on Thursday</a> to nearly a year behind bars.</p>



<p>The legal decision came about two months after Edwards was arrested for harassing his estranged wife&#8230; about a month after Edwards was arrested for possession of a controlled substance&#8230; and about a week after he was arrested again after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-found-unconscious-rushed-to-hospital-prior-to-latest-arrest/">police found him unconscious and unresponsive</a>.</p>



<p>Said a lawyer for the state of Kentucky on April 20 of Edwards:</p>



<p>&#8220;His option is to get clean or die. There will be a request for more rehabilitation. The opportunity he had he squandered. </p>



<p>&#8220;That is disrespectful to the court and makes a mockery.&#8221;</p>

<p>A judge essentially agreed, revoking Ryan&#8217;s probation and sentencing him 11 months and 29 days of jail time.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an extreme danger to himself, he died on Broad Street and had to be brought back to life,&#8221; the judge said in court.</p>



<p>&#8220;You would&#8217;ve been dead. You should realize that. He&#8217;s a danger to the public by driving his truck on drugs&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;You may have some problems with your wife, but you have three kids. I&#8217;m trying to save your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bookout shares a 14-year old son with Edwards, although <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/maci-bookout-ryan-edwards-still-wants-nothing-to-do-with-bentley/">Ryan scarcely sees the teenager</a>.</p>



<p>Hours after her ex was sent to jail, Bookout shared a video that featured two men discussing if someone should give up on a person who is going through a difficult time.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about giving up on people. It&#8217;s about accountability to take responsibility for one&#8217;s self,&#8221; said one person in this video.</p>



<p>&#8220;I cannot help you if you cannot be involved to help yourself. I will say to them point blank, Listen, if you&#8217;re not going to be involved in this then there&#8217;s no point to me being involved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bookout also shared a recent post that observers think was about Edwards and is ongoing saga.</p>



<p>It centered on the concept of inner peace.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard someone once say, &#8216;Healing can be so hard when your inner child wants love, your teenage self wants revenge, and your current self only wants peace.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Bookout and Edwards starred way back in the day on MTV&#8217;s 16 and Pregnant after the former pregnant when she was a junior in high school.</p>



<p>She gave birth to her son Bentley in October 2018.</p>
