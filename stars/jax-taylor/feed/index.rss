<p>Jax Taylor is coming clean about <em>getting</em> clean.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of Alex Baskin‘s “Hot Mic” podcast, the Vanderpump Rules alum announced very simply and straightforwardly on air:</p>



<p> “I am an addict.”</p>



<p>Taylor then delved into very personal detail about how this applies to him.</p>

<p>“I have substance issues &#8212; primarily with cocaine. It’s hard to say out loud,” Jax confessed. “I’ve been dealing with this on and off since I was 23 and now I’m 45. There was times where I would stop doing it but then there were times where I’d go heavy on it.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">Brittany Cartwright filed to divorce Taylor</a> last August.</p>



<p>Around this same time, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/">Taylor checked into a facility</a> to deal with mental health issues.</p>



<p>However, this podcast marked the first time he has ever admitted to these kinds of substance abuse problems.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1024x710.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor attends the LA art show opening night premiere party hosted by Jenna Dewan at Los Angeles Convention Center on February 19, 2025 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-519947" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-768x533.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-2048x1420.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-960x666.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor attends the LA art show opening night premiere party hosted by Jenna Dewan at Los Angeles Convention Center on February 19, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for LA Art Show)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taylor &#8212; who made his Bravo debut on Vanderpump Rules in 2013 &#8212; acknowledged that viewers and fans had picked up on this abuse over the years. </p>



<p>“[They] could kind of tell that I was on something. Obviously production and [other] people, they didn’t know what I was doing,” he said. &#8220;Everything I was doing was on my own but I was just on that train and I couldn’t get off.”</p>



<p>To help him stay off cocaine, Taylor went on to say he recently cut alcohol out of his life, as well.</p>

Rodriguez/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I’m proud to say I’m 83 days sober right now, which is the longest I’ve ever gone in my life without [alcohol or drugs],&#8221; Taylor told listeners on March 4.</p>



<p>Jax has not said much in public about his split from Cartwright.</p>



<p>His fellow reality star, however, has cited &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/">rage texts</a>&#8221; and other anger issues as a major basis for why she finally walked away from her spouse.</p>



<p>Taylor doesn&#8217;t bring up the divorce in this new interview, but does at least come across like a changed man; like he understands where he went wrong in many ways.</p>

<p>“For many years I’ve depended on alcohol and drugs as a way to cope and mask many deeper issues,&#8221; Taylor added separately on Tuesday to Us Weekly. </p>



<p>&#8220;This past year has been the hardest year of my life but also the most eye opening and transformative. Coming to terms with my many mental health challenges and being honest about my addiction — both with myself and others has been a crucial part of my healing. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been a day-by-day process, but I’m committed to my recovery and working towards a healthier future in order to be a better person and someone my son will be proud of one day.”</p>

<p>According to Brittany Cartwright, Jax Taylor&#8217;s time in rehab didn&#8217;t change him one bit.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> or the Jax-and-Brittany-based spinoff, <em>The Valley</em>, then you&#8217;re probably aware that Jax sometimes struggles to control his temper.</p>



<p>And by that, we mean he throws more temper tantrums than his three-year-old son.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-didn-t-help-jax-taylor">Brittany Cartwright Says Rehab Didn&#8217;t Help Jax Taylor</h2>



<p>Shortly after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/brittany-cartwright-my-sex-life-with-jax-sucked-before-our-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany separated from Jax </a>earlier in March, he made the decision to try and regulate some of the personal issues that had caused so many problems in his relationships.</p>



<p>Jax checked into rehab and vowed to change for the sake of his wife and son. Sadly, it seems that his efforts fell flat.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/brittany-cartwright-i-am-still-separated-from-jax-taylor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax and Brittany are still separated</a>, and she recently filed for divorce. And in a new interview with Bravo producer Alex Baskin, Brittany says Jax is as angry as ever.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like he changed at all in those 30 days. And the reason, I’m sure it’ll be on the show as well, but, you know, a lot of rage texting and stuff was still going on the entire time that he was in rehab,” she said.</p>



<p>“So, for me, I was just noticing like, this is just going to be constant.</p>



<p>“Like, if you’re in therapy seven hours a day, and you’re still finding time to call me names and cuss me out? And send me rage texts? Then you’re obviously not ever gonna change,&#8221; Brittany continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In the interview, Brittany explained that she decided to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file for divorce while Jax was in rehab </a>so that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to talk her out of it.</p>



<p>“I’m so glad I did, I’m not changing my mind. I’m so happy with this decision,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that Jax&#8217;s actions led her to realize, “This is bad, I can’t stay in this. It was very eye-opening.”</p>

<p>Brittany also spoke about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/brittany-cartwright-hook-up-after-jax-taylor-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hooking up with Jax&#8217;s longtime friend Julian Sensley</a>.</p>



<p>She says the decision was motivated by the fact that “it was somebody that [she] felt [she] knew,” and she “always thought he was so hot.”</p>



<p>“I was just so mad at Jax. I didn’t care if I hurt his feelings like that. Why should I care? [Jax] never cared about how he hurt my feelings for years,&#8221; Brittany explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;He put me down. He did so much to me that, I’m sorry you’re so upset about who it is, but at the same time, you didn’t give me attention, affection or anything for years.</p>

<p>“So, I was like, you know what? This guy is really hot, and I was taking care of myself, and Jax has no legs to stand on. He hooked up with my friend, let’s all remember that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, not only did <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/06/faith-stowers-jax-taylor-needs-to-be-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax hook up with Faith Stowers</a>, he did so while he and Brittany were dating!</p>



<p>So he really has no right to get mad at his ex for what she did after she filed for divorce.</p>



<p>But this is Jax Taylor we&#8217;re talking about. So he&#8217;s probably already thrown multiple tantrums over it.</p>

<p>After 11 seasons on Bravo, it&#8217;s hard to think that <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> could be canceled. </p>



<p>Unless, of course, you&#8217;re actually watching the show.</p>



<p>The truth of the matter is, fans are pretty disenchanted with the long-running reality show post-Scandoval. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the show&#8217;s new spin-off, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/vanderpump-villa-hulu-spinoff-details-cast-location-premiere-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanderpump Villa</a></em>, is turning out to be a major hit. </p>

<p>So, is <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>about to be canceled? According to insiders, the answer might be yes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vanderpump-rules-no-longer-bravo-ready-to-cancel-after-11th-season">&#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217; No Longer: Bravo Ready To Cancel After 11th Season</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/vanderpump-rules-season-12-filming-delayed-bravo-pause-summer-the-valley-1235900585/">many predicted</a>, production for the show&#8217;s 12th season did <em>not</em> begin in May, as it had in previous years.</p>



<p>And in recent months, many fans noted that <a href="https://people.com/vanderpump-rules-is-not-been-canceled-is-on-hiatus-8665544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several stars had deleted all mention of the series</a> from their social media accounts. </p>



<p>For obvious reasons, the situation led to rumors that the show had come to an end. But Bravo sources insist that that&#8217;s not the case.</p>





<p>“Everyone needs a moment to decompress after two very rough, intense seasons. The cast is looking forward to a break from filming the show,&#8221; a source close to the situation told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/30/entertainment/vanderpump-rules-pausing-production-for-the-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“Producers are excited to catch up with everyone when cameras eventually go back up,”</p>

<p>Producers&#8217; new goal, the outlet claims, is to give the cast some time &#8212; let their lives &#8220;breathe&#8221; &#8212; in the hope that some new drama will develop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ariana-madix-problem">The Ariana Madix Problem</h2>



<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of Ariana Madix, who&#8217;s booked and busy, and who may be starting to feel like her reality career has run its course.</p>



<p>Ariana is now the new host of <em>Love Island US</em>, and she revealed at a recent book festival that she&#8217;s considered quitting <em>Vanderpump</em>.</p>

<p>“Our show has always thrived, it’s always at its best when it is at its most authentic and its most real, and I have to be able to show up and be real and be authentic in order for it to make sense for me,” she said at a book festival.</p>



<p>“So that’s the question I would be asking myself going into it,” she explained.</p>



<p>Other insiders have noted that the recent success of <em>Vanderpump Villa</em> might be a bad sign for the VPR OGs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many may not know this, but <em>Vanderpump Villa</em> is actually a test to see if it can be as big of a show as <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>An insider revealed this tidbit to <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/11034791/vanderpump-villa-replace-vanderpump-rules-chopping-block/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>, explaining that Bravo has seen the writing on the wall, and the future of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> is bleak. </p>



<p>Fans have been revolting, even organizing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/vanderpump-rules-fans-boycott-show-after-worst-episode-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boycotts of the show</a> since it feels so tired. </p>



<p>And this this new spinoff feels like a fresh start, which might be exactly what the franchise needs. </p>

<p>The Hulu show follow Lisa and her hot &#8220;world-class staff&#8221; as they serve guests of Chateau Rosabelle, Lisa&#8217;s French countryside estate. It&#8217;s got everything: travel, drama, and attractive problematic young people. </p>



<p>And fans are loving it! So, is it curtains for <em>VPR</em>? </p>



<p>&#8220;Lisa is keeping an eye on the audience&#8217;s reaction,&#8221; a source explained. &#8220;<em>Villa</em> could replace <em>Rules</em> in the future, especially if VPR continues to sink and there aren&#8217;t as interesting storylines unfolding.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vanderpump-s-tricky-past">Vanderpump&#8217;s Tricky Past </h2>



<p>But isn&#8217;t the first time fans thought the show would be gone for good. </p>



<p>Reality TV stars are often encouraged to engage in outrageous behavior, but there&#8217;s a fine line between actions that are scandalously amusing from a distance, and those that are unacceptable under any circumstances.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s a lesson that the cast of <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>has learned the hard way over the years.</p>

<p>Remember the summer of 2020?</p>



<p>Longtime cast members <a href="/2020/06/stassi-schroeder-and-kristen-doute-fired-from-vanderpump-rules-a/">Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute were fired</a> from the show after it was revealed that they had engaged in racially motivated harassment of a Black co-star named Faith Stowers.</p>



<p>Newcomers Max Boyen and Brett Ciprioni were let go the same day after old, racist tweets of theirs were discovered.</p>



<p>Just as the dust began to settle from those scandals, the show was hit with yet another major casting shakeup.</p>



<p>Controversial series original <a href="/2020/12/jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/">Jax Taylor was fired from </a><em><a href="/2020/12/jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/" rel="nofollow">Vanderpump Rules</a>,</em> along with his wife, Brittany Cartwright.

<p>That&#8217;s when the original rumors that <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> would be canceled began to spread.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andy-cohen-on-vanderpump-rules-future">Andy Cohen On &#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217; Future</h2>



<p>Several sites reported at the time that Bravo execs decided to give <em>Vanderpump</em> the axe. They were just waiting until after the holidays to make the announcement.</p>



<p>But Andy Cohen was quick to deny the reports, and shared plans to bring back the remaining <em>Vanderpump</em> cast.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, they&#8217;ve got Lala [Kent], James [Kennedy], Scheana [Shay], Tom [Sandoval], Tom [Schwartz], Katie [Maloney], Arianna [Madix], the new people,&#8221; Cohen said on his radio show at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, that&#8217;s a solid cast. When that show&#8217;s going to start shooting again, I have no idea, but I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;m excited for there to be a shift also.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, that was before. Now we know not only was the show not canceled, but it was on the precipice of it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/ariana-madix-vs-tom-sandoval-exes-clash-in-explosive-vanderpump-rules-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest season ever</a>. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-2.02.30%E2%80%AFPM-1024x673.png" alt="Ariana Madix speaks to a producer" class="wp-image-495561"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Madix speaks to a producer in this scene from Vanderpump Rules.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-vanderpump-rules-managed-to-escape-cancellation-before-now">How Vanderpump Rules Managed To Escape Cancellation Before Now</h2>



<p>One word: Scandoval. </p>



<p>By now, we all know the tale: <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/tom-sandoval-returns-to-vanderpump-rules-causes-all-sorts-of-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Sandoval</a> had an affair with&nbsp;Rachel Leviss&nbsp;that shocked the world.</p>



<p>A world that, up until that point, seemed to have given up on the show. </p>



<p>But Scandoval saved the show from cancelation, renewing interest in the Bravo staple that was ready to conclude after season 10. </p>



<p>But now, Rachel is off the show, Ariana and Tom&#8217;s feuding is feeling tired, and the scandalous former co-stars have moved on to yet another Vanderpump spin-off that feels more interesting. </p>



<p>Bottom line: with fresh and old faces on new shows with excited audiences, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> days feel numbered. </p>



<p>Will it return for another season? Possibly. But it may well be the show&#8217;s last.</p>

<p>Brittany Cartwright moved on very quickly after her split from Jax Taylor!</p>



<p>A source close to the situation revealed that Brittany hooked up with Jax&#8217;s friend right after their split, according to a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/07/celebrity-news/brittany-cartwright-started-secretly-hooking-up-with-jax-taylors-pal-julian-sensley-shortly-after-separation/">report</a> from <em>Page Six. </em></p>



<p>The insider revealed that shortly after Jax and Brittany broke up in February, the <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>star began a &#8220;casual&#8221; fling with Julian Sensley. Julian is a basketball player-turned-actor, who was a bouncer at the bar TomTom.</p>



<p>After Brittany and Jax separated, the reality star reportedly began a short, &#8220;casual&#8221; physical relationship with Julian. The insider said that Brittany&#8217;s estranged husband &#8220;went beserk,&#8221; when he heard about the fling.</p>

<p>The source also admitted that Brittany&#8217;s romance with Julian was part of Jax&#8217;s reason for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking mental health treatment</a> in July 2024. </p>



<p>Julian is now engaged, and he shares a child with his fiancée. The pair were reportedly &#8220;off and on.&#8221; During the relationship with Brittany, they were &#8220;going through a rough patch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brittany did reveal that they had said that they could see other people in a June <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIrDEpphC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with <em>E! News</em>. &#8220;We’ve said going into this that we could test the waters with other people if we wanted to,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The drama surrounding the relationship will reportedly take part in <em>The Valley </em>season 2. The reality show&#8217;s next season is expected to air in 2025. </p>



<p>Julian also has an older child. An older rumor also romantically linked him to fellow <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>star Lala Kent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-did-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-break-up">When Did Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor Break Up?</h2>



<p>Brittany and Jax have been married since June 2019.

The pair seem dedicated to co-parenting Cruz since their split.</p>



<p>Jax had previously cheated on his wife, but it&#8217;s not clear if that played a part in the split.</p>



<p>They separated in February 2024. Brittany announced the separation on their podcast <em>When Reality Hits</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since the split, there have been a few times that people believed that they had reunited. The pair have remained separated since the split. In June, Brittany assured fans that they were still separated in the above-mentioned<em> </em>interview with <em>E! </em>She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially filed for divorce </a>in August 2024. </p>

<p>After filing for divorce, Brittany <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/brittany-cartwright-breaks-silence-on-jax-taylor-divorce-breaks-all-the-way-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened up about how difficult</a> the process has been on the <em>When Reality Hits </em>podcast. Still, she said that she was looking forward to the future.</p>



<p>&#8220;My decision to file wasn’t made lightly or quickly. It’s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I gained enough courage and strength to do what’s best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>While a divorce is undoubtedly difficult, Jax admitted that he felt that it was the right decision. He showed support for his ex on a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-breaks-silence-on-brittany-cartwright-divorce-she-made-the-right-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate episode</a> of the podcast. &#8220;Brittany did file for divorce. I understand why she did and I agree that this is the right decision for our family,&#8221; he explained. </p>



<p>Jax seemed to own up to his own shortcomings, as he continued. &#8220;I don’t blame her at all. I mean, I can’t believe she’s been with me this long as it is. That we stayed, to be honest,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is not making any excuses.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s not shirking any responsibility and he&#8217;s not point fingers &#8212; unless you count the ones he has placed in his own direction.</p>



<p>On the latest edition of his podcast, the Bravo personality spoke out for the first time about his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">divorce from Brittany Cartwright</a> after five years of marriage, surprising some listeners with the insight he had to share.</p>

<p>“I know that Brittany addressed our current situation on last week’s podcast. It’s been a really, really rough week. Anyone that has gone through a divorce will understand how difficult this is,” Taylor said. </p>



<p>“Brittany did file for divorce. I understand why she did and I agree that this is the right decision for our family.”</p>



<p>Continued the Vanderpump Rules and The Valley cast member, referencing his wife:</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame her at all. I mean, I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s been with me this long as it is. That we stayed, to be honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taylor previously cheated on Cartwright, although it is not believed that he did so again recently or that infidelity played a role in their divorce.</p>



<p>Last week, Brittany co-hosted this same podcast <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/brittany-cartwright-breaks-silence-on-jax-taylor-divorce-breaks-all-the-way-down/">and said of the split</a>, which will play out on The Valley Season 2:</p>



<p>“I never imagined I’d go through something so personal and painful while having the world watch. I’m not saying this for anyone to feel badly, but I know that this is the life I chose and I’m so fortunate in many ways. I always want to be real with y’all.”</p>

<p>Taylor and Cartwright are parents of a three-year old son named Cruz.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll always love and care for Brittany. She’s the mother of my beautiful son,&#8221; Jax said on September 6.</p>



<p>&#8220;All I want for us is to be amicable and even hopefully really, really good friends. One day. I know I’m an amazing father and I know that I will make an excellent ex-husband.”</p>



<p>Taylor also addressed his recent stay in a mental health facility, which resulted in the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-reveals-bipolar-disorder-ptsd-diagnoses-amid-divorce-filing/">diagnosis of PTSD and bipolar disorder</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got there and I f-cking hated it,&#8221; Taylor told fans.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then I loved it. I didn&#8217;t want to f-cking leave. I really, really didn&#8217;t. I was so sad leaving. I was crying, I was like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to go.&#8217; I was scared to leave those front doors because I got up in the morning, had my breakfast, structure, every day. I was reading.&#8221;</p>



<p>He concluded on this topic:</p>



<p>&#8220;I now have a little bit better understanding of my mental health struggles. I’ve been put on some serious medication that’s actually been helping me out a lot. </p>



<p>&#8220;In time, I’ll definitely speak more about it openly, but right now I kind of just need to deal with this process.”&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll give the final word here to Cartwright, who said on her August 30 podcast:</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I&#8217;ve gained enough courage to strength to do what was best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been very difficult, but I&#8217;m stronger than ever and my motivation is my son, my Cruzy, who deserves a happy and healthy mommy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jax Taylor has opened up about something very personal and, at times, quite painful.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-s-bipolar-confession-how-he-s-doing-now">Jax Taylor&#8217;s Bipolar Confession: How He&#8217;s Doing Now</h2>



<p>“A little over a month ago, I checked into an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/">intensive inpatient treatment facility</a> scared of the unknown and what I would find out about myself,” Taylor wrote online alongside a black-and-white photo of himself reading. </p>



<p>“After many years of knowing something was wrong but not knowing exactly what it was, I recently learned that I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taylor rose to small screen fame as a cast member on Vanderpump Rules and now helps anchor spinoff The Valley.</p>



<p>He and Brittany Cartwright<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/"> just filed for divorce</a> after five years of marriage.</p>

<p>Continued Taylor on Monday:</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been a lot to process and an emotional time for me, however I’ve come home to my son with a new found sense of peace.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared for the future but my focus is just trying to be a better version of myself than I was yesterday. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mental health is a lifelong battle of not letting it control you but rather you learning to control it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-why-he-went-to-rehab">This Is Why He Went To Rehab</h2>



<p>Taylor spent 30 days in the aforementioned facility this past July and August.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jax has always been candid about his mental health struggles, especially during the past few months on his podcast,” a representative for the reality star told People Magazine on July 30, adding back then: </p>



<p>“He has made the decision to seek in-patient treatment. This is a particularly sensitive time for him and his family. </p>



<p>&#8220;They ask for privacy and respect until he is ready to speak more on this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>“It’s been a big week,” Cartwright admitted on the August 30 episode of her and Jax’s joint podcast, “When Reality Hits,&#8221; marking the first time she has commented on the legal split.</p>



<p>As a dedicated reality star, Cartwright then teased the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-valley-season-2/">The Valley Season 2</a>:</p>



<p>“I unfortunately can’t speak to details since everything has been heavily documented on the show since we happen to be filming right now. </p>



<p>&#8220;You will see how everything plays out once the show airs, but I will say this: This season has been the most difficult season I have ever had to film.”</p>

<p>Cartwright and Taylor have had their relationship filmed in front of the cameras, but the former says it&#8217;s still been a challenge to see such a private matter play out in public:</p>



<p>“I never imagined I’d go through something so personal and painful while having the world watch. I’m not saying this for anyone to feel badly, but I know that this is the life I chose and I’m so fortunate in many ways. I always want to be real with y’all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taylor previously cheated on Cartwright, but the pair worked it out.</p>



<p>This time around, we can&#8217;t say for certain <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/did-jax-taylor-cheat-on-brittany-cartwright-again/">whether or not infidelity played</a> a role in the divorce.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-682x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508316" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend 4th Annual World Dog Day at West Hollywood Park on May 18, 2019 in West Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One thing is for certain, Brittany emphasized on this podcast: The divorce is NOT a publicity stunt.</p>



<p>“My decision to file wasn’t made lightly or quickly. It’s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I gained enough courage and strength to do what’s best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth,” she said. </p>



<p>“It’s been very difficult, but I’m stronger than ever … my motivation is my son, my Cruzie, who deserves a happy and healthy mommy. </p>



<p>&#8220;Moving forward, Jax and I will be doing the podcast separately.”</p>



<p>Cartwright and Taylor got married in 2019 and share three-year old son Cruz.</p>

<p>For his part, Taylor talked about the separation with Us Weekly in March, denying any talk of sleeping around as follows: </p>



<p>“I want people to know that it is possible to coparent and run businesses and be okay with each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not everybody just gets divorced because they cheated. Believe it or not, that was not the case. I know it’s shocking. We’re just not communicating right now and that’s all there is to it&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re taking some time for ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright are officially heading for a divorce. </p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s what fans have been hearing for years &#8211; but now, it&#8217;s true. </p>



<p>After five years of marriage, former <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> star Brittany Cartwright revealed she has filed for a divorce from husband Jax Taylor and that they are no longer living together.</p>



<p>Honestly, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-married/">Jax and Brittany got married</a> in 2019, fans were skeptical it would last the year.</p>



<p>Still, it&#8217;s sad to see a chapter close. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-amp-brittany-cartwright-s-divorce-official">Jax Taylor &amp; Brittany Cartwright&#8217;s Divorce Official</h2>



<p>Brittany Cartwright officially filed for divorce from Jax Taylor just before Labor Day in 2024. </p>



<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/27/celebrity-news/brittany-cartwright-files-for-divorce-from-jax-taylor-after-5-years-of-marriage/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pagesix_news_alert&amp;utm_content=20240827?&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=P6%20-%20News%20Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Court documents</a> filed Tuesday August 26 in Los Angeles  show that “The Valley” star filed for the dissolution of marriage with a minor child, according to<em> Page Six.</em> </p>



<p>She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and the date of separation as Jan. 24, 2024, a day before her birthday.</p>



<p>Brittany initially announced the separation on their joint podcast <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/when-reality-hits-with-jax-and-brittany/id1678330734?i=1000647572424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When Reality Hits</a></em> back in February. </p>



<p>&#8220;Many of you guys have been asking me about Jax and I and our relationship,&#8221; she shared during the Feb. 29 episode. &#8220;I just think it&#8217;s important to be real and honest with you guys because we&#8217;ve shared so much of our lives with you guys.&#8221;</p>



<p>But why? What has changed between the pair? Brittany answers that too. </p>



<p>&#8220;On my last podcast I alluded to many marriages go through rocky times,&#8221; Brittany, who shares 2-year-old son&nbsp;<strong>Cruz</strong>&nbsp;with Jax, continued. &#8220;Yes, marriages in general are very hard and I&#8217;ve had a particularly rough year this past year. Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moving out? A rough year? Something tells us the <em>Vandepump</em> spinoff, <em>The Valley,</em> which will star Jax and Brittany just got a whole lot more interesting! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-amp-brittany-cartwright-swore-divorce-would-not-happen-happen">Jax Taylor &amp; Brittany Cartwright Swore Divorce Would Not Happen Happen!</h2>



<p>“We would never get divorced, we don’t believe in that. Not sure [why] people are saying that.&#8221;</p>



<p>This was the response Jax gave to a commenter on Instagram back in December 2022. He has so far not made a statement about his split from Brittany after the news of the paper being filed. </p>



<p>In the docs, Brittany asked the judge to waive spousal support for her and Jax. She is also seeking joint custody of their 3-year-old son Cruz, with her ex getting visitation rights.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-signs-were-all-there">The Signs Were All There</h2>



<p>Prior to Jax&#8217;s comment above, Brittany hadn&#8217;t appeared on Jax&#8217;s Instagram page since July, which is sort of strange, considering the fact that dude posts constantly.</p>



<p>Then, out of the blue, the the happy couple were all smiles in a photo of them  at a People&#8217;s Choice Awards after party.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment on the sudden reappearance of Brittany, with many taking it as a sign that the divorce rumors were bogus.</p>



<p>“You two look incredible together! Please tell me the divorce rumors are false! You belong together [red heart emoji],&#8221; one person wrote. And Jax responded with the above &#8212; and he&#8217;s kept saying they&#8217;re good ever since. </p>

<p>A month after that award show, the duo&#8217;s talked about their marriage on their podcast,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/when-reality-hits-with-jax-and-brittany/id1678330734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When Reality Hits with Jax &amp; Brittany</a></em>.</p>



<p>They were quick to insist that they were making things work in their marriage and that they would continue to do so.</p>



<p>Because there was no other choice. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">&#8220;We would always hear when we got married, people were like, &#8216;They&#8217;ll be together for one year,&#8217; or whatever. Now we&#8217;ve been together for eight years, almost married for four. We&#8217;re trucking through,&#8221; Brittany said on the podcast. </p>



<p>Jax took things a step further. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in divorce. My parents didn&#8217;t get divorced,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in that. Marriage is work.&#8221;</p>

<p>He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying every day is amazing&#8230;There&#8217;s good days and there&#8217;s bad days, but that&#8217;s marriage, and that&#8217;s what makes your relationship stronger. We love hard. We fight hard. It&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-amp-brittany-s-marriage-the-highs-and-lows">Jax &amp; Brittany&#8217;s Marriage: The Highs and Lows</h2>



<p>Before they got<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/jax-taylor-reportedly-melting-down-following-bravo-firing-will-v/"> fired from <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> for being racist</a>, these two delivered non-stop drama as they careened toward the altar.</p>



<p>After all, Jax had been caught cheating on Brittany several times, most memorably with Faith Stowers.</p>



<p>Jax was later fired after it was revealed that he conspired with Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute to have Faith arrested for crimes she didn&#8217;t commit.</p>



<p>Like we said &#8212; there&#8217;s messy, and then there&#8217;s Jax Taylor!</p>

<p>But their divorce isn&#8217;t even the messiest thing happening in the lives of Brittany and Jax right now. </p>



<p>For one thing, Jax spent most of his summer in an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-to-leave-rehab-make-emotional-return-to-the-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-patient rehab center</a>. He checked in late July and just about a week before the divorce announcement, he was released. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0">&#8220;Jax has spent the last 30 days in treatment and will be heading back home later this week,” a representative for<em> The Valley </em>star confirmed to PEOPLE on Monday, Aug. 19.  “It’s been an emotional month for him and he’s most looking forward to spending time with his son.” </p>



<p>Speaking of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/vanderpump-rules-spinoff-confirmed-who-will-star-on-the-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Valley</a></em> &#8211; the hit spin-off of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> has been greenlit for another season. In fact, as we understand it, the show is in production right now. </p>



<p>AND BOTH BRITTANY AND JAX SHOULD BE RETURNING. </p>





<p>Yeah, this won&#8217;t be awkward at ALL!</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is hopefully back to a peaceful state of existence.</p>



<p>And now we hear he&#8217;s ready to get back to work, as well.</p>



<p>According to TMZ, the long-time Bravo personality <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/19/valley-jax-taylor-leaving-treatment/">will soon leave the mental health</a> treatment center he entered as a patient a few weeks ago and resume his life in the very near future as a father and a reality star.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor on a red carpet" class="wp-image-507615" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1502817509-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor attends a Young Hollywood Screening of &#8220;Mission: Impossible &#8211; Dead Reckoning Part One&#8221; presented by Paramount Pictures and Skydance at the Paramount Theatre on June 26, 2023, in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/">Taylor checked into this facility</a> in the wake of a separation from wife Brittany Cartwright.</p>



<p>By all accounts, he and Cartwright are NOT getting back together; not at the moment, anyway.</p>



<p>Taylor will reside once again in his Los Angeles home and focus on his relationship with son Cruz, while Cartwright will continue to live in a nearby rental.</p>



<p>Look for Taylor to also jump into Season 2 of The Valley, which started filming earlier this summer.</p>



<p>Viewers can expect &#8220;an emotional&#8221; run of episodes upon Taylor&#8217;s return to this reality series, TMZ also emphasizes.</p>

<p>Taylor and Cartwright, who got married in 2019, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">confirmed their separation in February</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Marriages in general are very hard and I’ve had a particularly rough year this past year. Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health,&#8221; Brittany said on an episode of her podcast at the time.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been some confusion about the couple&#8217;s status ever since.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound as if Taylor cheated on Cartwright again, but it <em>does</em> sound as if Brittany is not anxious for a reconciliation.</p>

<p>“You’re not just gonna get away with the way you’ve treated me for all these years,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/brittany-cartwright-i-am-still-separated-from-jax-taylor/">Cartwright screamed at Taylor</a> at one point on the finale of The Valley last season, adding back then:</p>



<p>“Jax has been saying that he’s gonna go to therapy for years now. The day before we pick cameras back up, he all of a sudden has an appointment to go see the doctor. This is all a front.</p>



<p>“This is what he wants everyone to see and believe that he’s actually gonna do these things to change. I bet you money he will not do it.”</p>



<p>Brittany said this prior to Taylor checking in to the aforementioned facility.</p>

<p>To be clear, no divorce papers have been filed between Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright.</p>



<p>We have no idea if they ever will be.</p>



<p>But we strongly hope Taylor has received the help he needs and that Cartwright continues to improve her mental health and that both spouses always remember to put their child above everything else.</p>

<p>Is Jax Taylor keeping the money that was supposed to go to a cancer charity?</p>



<p>Because fans had a <em>very </em>different impression.</p>



<p>In early 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright split</a>. And the apparent end of their marriage did not end their drama.</p>



<p>With <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/vanderpump-rules-season-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on hiatus</a>, their <em>mess </em>is spilling over onto social media. That includes the accusation that Jax is pocketing money that was supposed to go to charity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-jax-taylor-keeping-the-money-that-he-makes-on-cameo">Is Jax Taylor keeping the money that he makes on Cameo?</h2>



<p>On Saturday, August 10, Brittany Cartwright took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brittany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story to accuse her estranged husband, Jax Taylor, of some seriously underhanded dealings.</p>



<p>Originally, Jax assured fans that money that they paid him through Cameo would then become charitable donations. Specifically, he said that at least a portion of his earnings would go to esophageal cancer research.</p>



<p>Cameo is a customized-video app that celebrities of all echelons of fame can use. Fans order a short video &#8212; sometimes as a gag gift or a birthday present or simply for themselves &#8212; and a famous person spends 30 seconds or so talking into their phone. An industrious Cameo creator can make thousands of dollars a day doing this.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright in September of 2019." class="wp-image-507062" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor (L) and Brittany Cartwright attend âA Ride Through the Agesâ: Wrangler Capsule Collection Launch at Fred Segal Sunset at Fred Segal on September 19, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Erik Voake/Getty Images for Wrangler)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Brittany Cartwright, Jax has not followed through on his charitable Cameo vow.</p>



<p>She fired off her accusation on her Story, alleging that he has not paid forward even &#8220;a dime&#8221; of those earnings.</p>



<p>Jax&#8217;s father passed away in 2017 after a battle with esophageal cancer. Brittany&#8217;s allegation really cuts to the heart of his character as a person &#8230; and also signals that she&#8217;s not holding back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-has-used-the-valley-to-promote-his-cameo-side-hustle">Jax has used &#8216;The Valley&#8217; to promote his Cameo side hustle</h2>



<p>As <em>The Valley</em> viewers can attest, Jax Taylor used the series premiere to very performatively sit down with his laptop and pour through his Cameo requests.</p>



<p>This served as both an advertisement for his Cameo services <em>and </em>a way to boost his image on the show. He&#8217;s essentially showing off how many people are willing to pay for him to make a short custom video.</p>



<p>Not all reality shows would allow one of the cast to plug themselves in such a crass manner. But you have to admit that it fits well with Jax&#8217;s brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.cameo.com/mrjaxtaylor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor&#8217;s Cameo</a> account no longer shows that original introductory video &#8212; the one with the vow to donate to cancer research.</p>



<p>His new introduction simply sings his own praises and lists reasons for might buy one &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a birthday message, a friendly roast, or an offer of advice. (<em>Who </em>is getting life advice from Jax?)</p>



<p>Oh, and there&#8217;s also the price. The starting ask for a Jax Taylor Cameo is $128. And according to his ex, Jax Taylor is keeping that money for himself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-valley-is-filming-season-2">&#8216;The Valley&#8217; is filming Season 2</h2>



<p>Even with <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> on hiatus &#8212; but don&#8217;t worry; more is coming &#8212; the messy and chaotic lives of the Bravolebrities go on.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll get to see a good portion of that on <em>The Valley</em> Season 2.</p>



<p>One does have to wonder if Jax Taylor will keep promoting his Cameo. With his estranged wife calling him out, <em>less </em>attention might better serve him.</p>
