<p>For some reason, his rant included the line: &quot;Free Bill Cosby.&quot; Well, convicted sexual predator Bill Cosby is now thanking him for his words.</p>

</p>
<p>In the wake of Kobe Bryant&#8217;s death, a number of people noted that Kobe had been prosecuted for the alleged sexual assault of a 19-year-old.</p>
<p>To sports fans, Kobe is a legend. But to people who&#8217;ve never cared about sports, Kobe&#8217;s name makes them think of the sexual assault case.</p>
<p>For reasons that we cannot fathom, <em>The Washington Post</em>&nbsp;<em>suspended </em>a reporter for simply tweeting on the subject. They later reinstated her.</p>
<p>One of the people to point out that Kobe&#8217;s legacy is more complicated was Gayle King. And that sent Snoop Dogg through the roof.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Gayle King, out of pocket for that s&#8211;t, way out of pocket,&quot; Snoop Dogg complained in an Instagram rant.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you gain from that?&quot; he demanded to know. &quot;I swear to God, we the worst, we the f&#8211;king worst.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We expect more from you, Gayle,&quot; Snoop complained. &quot;Don&#8217;t you hang out with Oprah?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why you all attacking us?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;We&#8217;re your people. You ain&#8217;t coming after f&#8211;king Harvey Weinstein asking him dumb-ass questions.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>If discussing one alleged rapist meant having to list every known alleged rapist, no one would have time for anything else.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanna call you one &#8230; funky, dog-haired bitch. How dare you try and tarnish my motherf&#8211;king homebody&#8217;s reputation, punk motherf&#8211;ker?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Respect the family and back off, bitch,&quot; Snoop admonished, before issuing a threat: &quot;Before we come get you.&quot;</p>
<p>Well that was unspeakably vile and, frankly, not spoken in a way that Kobe would have found acceptable.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For the record, Kobe Bryant issued a public apology to his accuser, acknowledging the pain that she had experienced.</p>
<p>Though he did not quite allocute to the crime, he did acknowledge that he did not suspect the 19-year-old&#8217;s motives.</p>
<p>That is &#8230; profoundly atypical in celebrity rape cases. It was clear that he did not intend any harm.</p>
<p>Many disagree over whether that matters in the long run, but one would think that it would impact how people like Snoop discuss the subject.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Snoop&#8217;s rant over one question that Gayle King asked in an interview was bad enough on its own.</p>
<p>(Obviously, we all want the Bryant family to take time to heal, but Gayle was conducting an interview and asked a sensible question)</p>
<p>But then, for whatever reason, Snoop decided to go from a rant in poor taste to saying something truly despicable.</p>
<p>&quot;Free Bill Cosby,&quot; Snoop tweeted. There is simply no excuse for that.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There&#8217;s an old saying that goes: &quot;Speak of the devil and he shall appear.&quot; Well, that staying still applies today.</p>
<p>Convicted rapist Bill Cosby replied to Snoop&#8217;s rant on Instagram.</p>
<p>&quot;When they brought me to my gated community and placed me inside of my penthouse,&quot; Cosby&#8217;s nauseating reply begins.</p>
<p>He insists that &quot;they didn&#8217;t win, nor did they silence me.&quot; More&#8217;s the pity.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="727" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-727x1024.jpg" alt="Bill Cosby Booking Pic" class="wp-image-309890" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-727x1024.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-213x300.jpg 213w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-768x1082.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-735x1036.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-238x335.jpg 238w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-246x347.jpg 246w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-369x520.jpg 369w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-454x640.jpg 454w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-545x768.jpg 545w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-681x960.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic-766x1080.jpg 766w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/bill-cosby-booking-pic.jpg 968w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;it&#8217;s so sad and disappointing that successful black women are being used to tarnish the image and legacy of successful black men even in death,&quot; Cosby whines.</p>
<p>That would be a real shame if it were happening. It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>He asks: &quot;Are these people that in need of ratings, fame, and/or money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of myself, Camille, and my family, thank you, thank you, and thank you,&quot; Cosby writes to Snoop.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Then, in the same breath that Cosby speaks of Kobe, he also invokes the name of Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>It is clear that Cosby and Snoop are both buying into the absurd conspiracy theory that famous black men are being targeted and framed.</p>
<p>While the history of white supremacy includes countless examples of just that, this theory serves only to protect sexual predators.</p>
<p>Besides, as many have noted to Snoop since his clownish rant, men like Cosby and R. Kelly&#8217;s alleged victims include black women.</p>
<p>Any community can have monsters lurking within it at any level. Snoop needs to accept that if he wants to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Now, Snoop is doubling down on that, and also giving Trump&#8217;s supporters a piece of his mind.</p>
<p>Snoop is singling out one Trump supporter in particular: Kanye West.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>In an appearance on&nbsp;DJ Suss One&rsquo;s SiriusXM, Snoop Dogg did not mince words.</p>
<p>Not when he spoke about Donald Trump, and not when he spoke about Trump&#8217;s fans and supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;F&#8211;k you,&quot; Snoop said to address any Trump supporters who might be listening.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Snoop continued. &quot;F&#8211;k him.&quot;</p>
<p>While many Americans may share that sentiment in one form or another, not everyone is willing to be so blunt.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Snoop made it clear that his ire extends to his fellow celebrities.</p>
<p>Snoop added: &quot;Kanye, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t forget about him too,&quot; Snoop repeated. &quot;F&#8211;k you too!&quot;</p>
<p>As we mentioned, Snoop has excoriated Kanye for his bizarre support for Donald Trump in the past. Now, Snoop is doubling down on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Throw him in the bag too,&quot; Snoop said in reference to Kanye. &quot;Because he&rsquo;s right there with the motherf&#8211;kers.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-679x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West as a Guest" class="wp-image-305674" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-768x1158.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-735x1108.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-222x335.jpg 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-230x347.jpg 230w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-345x520.jpg 345w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-424x640.jpg 424w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-509x768.jpg 509w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-637x960.jpg 637w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest-716x1080.jpg 716w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/kanye-west-as-a-guest.jpg 906w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Most of us vividly remember Kanye&#8217;s multiple declarations of support for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kanye had what many assumed was a mental breakdown, and began tweeting things that made little to no sense to his millions of followers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are both dragon energy,&quot; Kanye said of Trump. &quot;He is my brother.&quot;</p>
<p>The man who had declared in 2005 that George W. Bush had no compassion for black people or their well being seemed to have shifted his own priorities.</p>
<p>But Snoop had his own theory for why Kanye was seeing orange.</p>

<p><a href="/videos/snoop-dogg-kanye-west-needs-a-black-woman-kim-is-trash/">Snoop Dogg says that Kanye West needs a black woman</a> to set him straight and to talk sense into him.</p>
<p>He says that Kim Kardashian humors Kanye too much when she should be influencing him to be a better, less self-sabotaging person.</p>
<p>Snoop believes that, were Kanye&#8217;s late mother still among the living, Kanye would not have said and done the stupid things that have become a huge part of his brand for the past decade.</p>
<p>That means that Kanye would have voted in 2016 and would never have voiced or felt support for Trump.</p>
<p>Still, others say that perhaps Snoop is just making excuses for Kanye, just like the people who are saying that Kanye is mentally ill.</p>

<p>Maybe Kanye isn&#8217;t mentally ill and maybe he isn&#8217;t lost without a black woman in his life. Maybe he&#8217;s just &#8230; bad.</p>
<p>And it sounds like Snoop may have come to that conclusion, because he is no longer suggesting things that Kanye needs.</p>
<p>A simple &quot;f&#8211;k you&quot; may be what Kanye deserves &#8212; at least, that seems to be how Snoop feels.</p>
<p>Unlike many people, who walk on eggshells while discussing Trump&#8217;s supporters but are perfectly blunt when discussing Trump, Snoop isn&#8217;t making allowances for &quot;economic anxiety.&quot;</p>
<p>If you support Trump, Snoop has made it very clear where you stand in his eyes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just in case anyone has forgotten: Snoop Dogg is a gift. In so many ways. But &#8230; did he miss the mark this time?</p>
<p>During an appearance on The View, they asked Snoop about <a href="/2018/05/kanye-west-basically-blames-black-people-for-slavery/">Kanye West basically blaming black people for slavery</a>.</p>
<p>Snoop says that Kim isn&#8217;t doing Kanye any good &#8212; that he needs a black woman in his life.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As you can see in the attached video, Snoop shares some heartwarming thoughts and experiences.</p>
<p>When asked about his response to Kanye suggesting that 400 years of slavery sounded like &quot;a choice,&quot; Snoop is characteristically direct.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought he needed some medical attention, first and foremost.&quot;</p>
<p>Many people thought that, though <a href="/slideshows/kim-kardashian-blasts-the-media-kanye-isnt-unstable-hes-a-genius/">Kim Kardashian blasted the media</a> for questioning her husband&#8217;s mental state.</p>
<p>&quot;But then, once I got past the laughing, I started feeling sad for him.&quot;</p>
<p>That was a widespread experience.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Snoop continues.</p>
<p>&quot;He truly misses his mother.&quot;</p>
<p>Donda West tragically passed away in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;He truly misses a black woman in his life.&quot;</p>
<p>That, as you can imagine, is where his comments turned controversial. But Snoop tries to clarify what he means.</p>
<p>&quot;He truly misses the stability of having somebody telling him when he&rsquo;s wrong and correcting him and checking him.&quot;</p>
<p>He clearly feels that Kim is not doing right by Kanye by allowing him to spout off nonsense without criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;As opposed to allowing him to continue to do what he&rsquo;s been doing.&quot;</p>
<p>In Snoop&#8217;s mind, Kanye needs a serious reality check from the people who love him.</p>
<p>&quot;And that to me is something that he needs.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Snoop says that Kanye clearly needs some kind of support or assistance.</p>
<p>&quot;He needs help.&quot;</p>
<p>In his opinion, Kanye&#8217;s outlandish statements aren&#8217;t designed to hurt anyone &#8212; they&#8217;re a symptom of something else.</p>
<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s crying out for help, so instead of me bashing him, we trying to help him now.&quot;</p>
<p>That is very compassionate of Snoop.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Back in April, Snoop weighed in on Kanye&#8217;s controversies and outbursts, writing:</p>
<p>&quot;The evolution of&nbsp;Jay-Z&nbsp;and Kanye show you how influential your wife can be to&nbsp;your life.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh wow. Jay-Z, of course, has made tremendous strides in being a better person. And Kanye &#8230; well, we all know what he&#8217;s been like.</p>
<p>But is Kim really to blame?</p>
<p>In any case, a source told <em>HollywoodLife </em>that <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/27/snoop-dogg-not-scared-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-instagram-diss/">Snoop isn&#8217;t worried</a> about backlash from Kanye over his public disses.</p>
<p>&quot;<span class="il">Snoop</span>&nbsp;clearly was calling out Kim and Kanye with his wife comments.&quot;</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>&quot;And he is not scared one bit if Kanye drops a verse on him to get back at&nbsp;<span class="il">Snoop.</span>&quot;</p>
<p>Well, we don&#8217;t imagine that the idea of Kanye singing about him has Snoop quaking in his boots. Why would it?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Obviously, Snoop&#8217;s comments are controversial.</p>
<p>Though Snoop refers to Kanye missing his mother, it is not difficult to interpret his words as saying that Kanye being married to a white woman is the cause of his behavior.</p>
<p>Let us be clear: <em>Kanye </em>is responsible for Kanye&#8217;s behavior. Kim is not Kanye&#8217;s therapist or shaman or whatever. She&#8217;s his wife.</p>
<p>And black women are, in fact, people. They don&#8217;t exist to be life coaches or common sense providers or nurturers to be prescribed to grown men who don&#8217;t know how to speak without putting their foot in their mouth.</p>
<p>A lot of people care about Kanye and want to explain away his behavior as the result of something external. Maybe Kim or maybe mental illness.</p>
<p>The reason that they want to believe that is because Kanye&#8217;s words don&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>But another reason is that perhaps people who have admired Kanye for a long time don&#8217;t want to think that their erstwhile hero is just &#8230; <em>bad</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This not exactly just in:</p>
<p>Snoop Dogg is not a fan of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This was made clear in March when the <a href="/videos/snoop-dogg-jokes-about-assassinating-trump-in-controversial-new/">rapper joked about killing the President</a>.</p>
<p>Just a few months later, <a href="/2017/11/snoop-dogg-jokes-about-death-of-trump-incurs-ire-of-number-maga/">Snoop Dogg again referenced the death of Trump</a>, earning serious ire from everyone on Twitter who says he or she just wants to Make America Great Again.</p>
<p>Now, the veteran artist has recorded a YouTube video in which he SLAMS the Commander-in-Chief for a pair of recent actions/words/Tweets.</p>

<p>Last week, Trump helped convince the Chinese government to release three UCLA basketball players who had been caught stealing sunglasses from a store prior to the basketball team playing a game in that country.</p>
<p>One of those players was LiAngelo Ball, the son of LeVar Ball, the outspoken father of NBA rookie Lonzo&nbsp;Ball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Trump worked to get Ball sent home, the President demanded that he and his teammates show him some gratitude.</p>
<p>LiAngelo did so. But LeVar basically mocked Trump instead, resulting in the following Tweet from the President:</p>
<p><em>Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. </em></p>
<p><em>China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!</em></p>
<p>Yes, the President of the United States said he should have let citizens rot in a foreign prison because he was not properly thanked after doing his duty.</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday, Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch played a game in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Before it began, he sat for the American national anthem&#8230; and stood up for the Mexican national anthem.</p>
<p>Trump responded as follows:</p>
<p><em>Marshawn Lynch of the NFL&rsquo;s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. </em></p>
<p><em>Attendance and ratings way down.</em></p>
<p>(Editor&#8217;s Note: Attendance is actually up on average for NFL games this season. And America is the land of the free and all that.)</p>
<p>This all brings us back to Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>In responds to President Trump picking a fight with LeVar Ball and Marshawn Lynch, the rapper makes it very clear in the footage below that he stands with the two sports figures.</p>
<p>And strongly against The Donald.</p>
<p>&quot;F-ck you, Donald Trump, and everything you stand for,&quot; Snoop says bluntly.</p>
<p>And then he says A LOT more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Well, it&#8217;s November, which means the season of familial discord is fast approaching.</p>
<p>As you know, the 2017 political landscape offers a panoply of options in terms of potential Thanksgiving debate topics that are sure to trigger a third coronary event for your Uncle Lou.</p>
<p>So you probably don&#8217;t need any help infuriating your more conservative kin.</p>
<p>However, just in case you need a hand, Snoop D-O-double-G is happy to assist:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s the cover of Snoop&#8217;s newly-released album <em>Make America Crip Again</em>.</p>
<p>As you can see, the photo isn&#8217;t exactly subtle in its anti-Trump sentiment.</p>
<p>Paying homage to Ice Cube&#8217;s 1991 album <em>Death Certificate</em>, Snoop is seen sipping from a Crip-blue Solo cup and glaring down at the corpse of the Donald.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the rapper&#8217;s first political controversy this year, as back in March, a video in which <a href="/videos/snoop-dogg-pretends-to-shoot-donald-trump/">Snoop pretends to assassinate Trump</a> made major waves on social media.</p>
<p>Needless to say, lots of folks on Twitter have been thoroughly butthurt by Snoop&#8217;s brand of satire&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; but most of them have Pepe the Frog avatars, and thus, their opinions are not to be taken seriously.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-940x1024.jpg" alt="Snoop Dogg on a Stage" class="wp-image-258980" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-940x1024.jpg 940w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-275x300.jpg 275w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-768x837.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-1410x1536.jpg 1410w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-1880x2048.jpg 1880w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-735x801.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-308x335.jpg 308w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-319x347.jpg 319w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-477x520.jpg 477w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-587x640.jpg 587w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-705x768.jpg 705w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-881x960.jpg 881w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/snoop-dogg-on-a-stage-991x1080.jpg 991w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Snoop Dogg&#8217;s career is running on fumes, hence the need to jump on the refuge of the talentless &#8211; the Trump Derangement Syndrome bandwagon,&quot; one snowflake said about the platinum-selling music legend who currently hosts two television shows.</p>
<p>&quot;HOW DOES THIS PRICK get away with this crap?&quot; tweeted a guy who we probably don&#8217;t need to tell you has a photo of a very angry-looking bald eagle as his profile pic.</p>
<p>For his part, Snoop has yet to sound off on the controversy.</p>
<p>And thankfully, against all odds, the president hasn&#8217;t tweeted about either.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="/2017/10/paul-manafort-former-trump-campaign-chairman-indicted-by-federal/">45 has a lot on his plate these days</a>, so he might be a bit distracted at the moment.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Hey, there&#8217;s a fun game!</p>
<p>Test your friends&#8217; prejudice levels by showing them photos of Snoop and Trump and asking them to guess which one is worried about going to prison because all his friends are being indicted.</p>
<p>Lob that one at Uncle Lou over pumpkin pie if you want, but make sure you&#8217;ve got a defibrillator handy.</p>
<p>If you feel like suffering a few mild strokes of your own, pose the question to your social media followers and marvel at the ignorance that ensues.</p>
<p>After all, Twitter is basically what would happen if you let the kids sit at the grownup table and got them loaded on gin and then it turned out the kids were all super racist.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Honestly, <a href="/2017/07/rob-kardashian-goes-off-on-blac-chyna-youre-a-cheater-and-a-liar/">Rob Kardashian&#8217;s feud with Blac&nbsp;Chyna</a> is explosive and bonkers and probably isn&#8217;t due to go away any time soon. The whole thing is nuts and Rob is tweeting so impulsively and unwisely that it&#8217;s downright Presidential.</p>
<p>But now Snoop Dogg is weighing in on the feud. Is Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Instagram the relationship advice column we never knew we needed?</p>
<p>Please, take a few moments to watch this video. It will brighten your view of the situation and will hopefully improve your whole day.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So, if you somehow missed this, Rob Kardashian&#8217;s been posting nudes of the mother of his child to get revenge on her, because he claims that she&#8217;s been cheating.</p>
<p>After Instagram shut down his whole page for obvious reasons, he <a href="/slideshows/rob-kardashian-roasted-on-twitter-for-blac-chyna-slut-shaming/">reposted Chyna&#8217;s nudes on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, that is tasteless and creepy and some wonder if <a href="/2017/07/rob-kardashian-will-he-face-revenge-porn-charges/">Rob Kardashian will be prosecuted for revenge porn</a> as a result.</p>
<p>Nobody ever accused Rob of emotional maturity, though.</p>
<p>Before things took a more serious turn with <a href="/2017/07/blac-chyna-rob-kardashian-beat-me-forced-me-to-stay-silent/">Blac Chyna accusing Rob Kardashian of domestic violence</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this after they so very recently had a transparent photo op &#8230; we mean, meaningful family trip &#8230; <a href="/2017/06/blac-chyna-and-rob-kardashian-see-their-disney-trip-with-dream/">to Disneyland with Dream</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Snoop&#8217;s take is mostly that he has zero sympathy for Rob in this situation.</p>
<p>&quot;He knew what he was getting into when he got her.&quot;</p>
<p>Not to be mean to Rob, but there was a hotness disparity.</p>
<p>There usually is when there&#8217;s this big of a wealth disparity.</p>
<p>Also, like, Blac Chyna already had a son with Kylie Jenner&#8217;s&nbsp;then-boyfriend, so she didn&#8217;t just show up out of nowhere like some femme fatale.</p>
<p>Rob had to have known that their relationship didn&#8217;t start by accident, right?</p>
<p>&quot;She is what she is, she wants what she wants, man.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true of everyone, right?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Then Snoop goes off.</p>
<p>&quot;Quit crying to the internet.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe someone will sympathize with Rob, but we sure aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;ve got more money to burn &#8212; go buy you another.&quot;</p>
<p>That is hilarious and possibly misogynistic but we all know what Snoop means, right?</p>
<p>&quot;Blac Chyna just did what she was supposed to do.&quot;</p>
<p>And what is <em>that</em>, you wonder?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; Snoop spells it out:</p>
<p>&quot;She seen a sucker, she licked it.&quot;</p>
<p>That line had us in stitches.</p>
<p>Bless.</p>
