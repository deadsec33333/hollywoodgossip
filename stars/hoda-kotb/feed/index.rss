<p>Savannah Guthrie ran into an old friend &#8212; and colleague &#8212; on vacation.</p>



<p>It truly is a small world.</p>



<p>Early last autumn, Hoda Kotb announced that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/hoda-kotb-qutting-today-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting <em>The Today Show</em></a> after 17 years. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that she never expected to see Savannah again. But what are the odds that they bump into each other on vacation?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-today-reunion-alert-savannah-guthrie-and-hoda-kotb-had-a-run-in-in-palm-beach">&#8216;TODAY&#8217; reunion alert! Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb had a run-in in Palm Beach!</h2>



<p>Motherhood was part of what <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/hoda-kotb-says-5-year-old-daughter-convinced-her-to-quit-today-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">convinced Hoda Kotb</a> to step away from <em>The Today Show</em>. So, it is only natural that she is enjoying time with her daughters, Haley and Hope.</p>



<p>This time, they have been vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida. The coastal town is a common destination for tourists, and if you&#8217;re going to go to Florida, February is about as accommodating as the peninsula&#8217;s weather can be.</p>



<p>It is no surprise that Hoda ran into many other vacationers. But what are the odds that one of them was Savannah Guthrie?</p>

<p>On Tuesday, February 18, Savannah Guthrie took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGOCJqwxiX_/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page to share that she and Hoda Kotb had enjoyed an unplanned reunion in Palm Beach.</p>



<p>“Oh and a bonus @hodakotb sighting for a little extra (sunshine),” she captioned the post. Naturally, plenty of fans took to the comments to cheer on the reunion. Some claimed to have predicted the get-together.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on Instagram, Savannah had shared glimpses of her own family, including 10-year-old Vale and 8-year-old Charley as they did their best to enjoy this time in Florida.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-savannah-guthrie-praised-the-family-time">Savannah Guthrie praised the family time</h2>



<p>Alongside photos of her kids and her husband, Michael Feldman, she shared a warm caption.</p>



<p>“Turns out all they needed was more sunshine, more pink, more bingo, more pink, more warmth, more pink drinks, more time more together,&#8221; she listed. That&#8217;s a lot of pink!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Hoda shared plenty of similar vacation snaps featuring her own daughters and more.</p>

<p>Hoda also shared a glimpse, as you can see below, in which she took daughters Haley and Hope fishing. No sign of Savannah Guthrie or any (current) NBC anchors.</p>



<p>“Wait… whaaaattt &#8212; each of my girls caught a fish today!!” she wrote in her Instagram caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;#wow threw em back,&#8221; Hoda quickly clarified for her followers. &#8220;But what a thrill!” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-to-be-clear-these-were-separate-trips">To be clear, these were separate trips</h2>



<p>Both Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie took these family trips separately. Whether they privately coordinated is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>



<p>It was only about one month ago that Hoda had her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/hoda-kotb-reveals-new-role-at-nbc-following-today-show-departure-im-coming-for-your-job-snoop-dogg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very last day at <em>The Today Show</em></a>. After 17 years as an institution (and 26 years for NBC News overall), it was time.</p>



<p>Hoda remains a household name. Fans are still processing her departure. And Savannah is still one of the most influential people on the planet.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the end of an era, as Hoda has been a part of the <em>Today</em> family since 2007.</p>

<p>She&#8217;ll be greatly missed, of course, but there are multiple silver linings to this week&#8217;s sad news.</p>



<p>For one thing, Hoda&#8217;s replacement is none other than the eminently likable <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/who-will-replace-hoda-kotb-on-today/">Craig Melvin</a>, so viewers will still be greeted by a familiar face in the morning.</p>



<p>And in other good news, Hoda is stepping away for the best of all reasons:</p>

<p>The iconic TV personality has decided to dedicate herself to spending more time with her loved ones.</p>



<p>Hoda is mother to two young girls, Haley Joy Kotb and Hope Catherine Kotb. And she says it was Hope who convinced her that it was time to open a new chapter in her life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/hoda-kotb-daughter-hope-leave-today-show-rcna186425">Speaking with her <em>Today</em> show colleagues</a>, Hoda said that sometime last year, she began to feel that her career had peaked.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew that that was the best it was going to be,&#8221; she explained.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1391487715-682x1024.jpg" alt="Hoda Kotb attends the 2022 Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame at The Ziegfeld Ballroom on April 14, 2022 in New York City.

<p>&#8220;I was on top of the mountain, and I was looking out, and I said, &#8216;God, this is amazing.'&#8221; </p>



<p>The feeling was bolstered shortly thereafter, while Hoda was playing outside with her youngest daughter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unexpected-wisdom">Unexpected Wisdom</h2>



<p>&#8220;And then it was kind of underscored because, like, a week or so before, my little girl Hope was climbing a tree, and she loves this tree, and she was at the top,&#8221; Hoda explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;And so, I said, &#8216;Look at you. You&#8217;re on top of that tree.&#8217; I go, &#8216;What are you going to do — what are you going to do now?'&#8221; </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1447732588-1024x683.jpg" alt="Hoda Kotb speaks at the Forbes 50 Over 50 Luncheon at Forbes on Fifth on December 08, 2022 in New York City.

<p>It was then that Hope delivered some unintentional career advice.</p>



<p>&#8220;She goes, &#8216;I guess I&#8217;ll find a different tree,'&#8221; Hoda recalled.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I thought, &#8216;Oh my gosh.&#8217; So sometimes the world starts showing you. So I kind of knew that it was time to try something different, and that means, you know, having my kids ride sidecar next to me more often than they have been.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2163661428-819x1024.jpg" alt="Hoda Kotb attends the Team USA Welcome Experience ahead of Paris 2024 on July 25, 2024 in Paris, France.

<p>Not surprisingly, Hoda&#8217;s daughters were thrilled to learn that she&#8217;ll soon be spending more time at home. But apparently, they wish she&#8217;d made that decision much earlier.</p>



<p>“I was telling them, ‘Mommy is going to be able to take you to school,’ and they go, ‘(Gasp) Wednesday?’ ‘No, honey, not Wednesday.’ ‘Next week?’ I go, ‘No, honey, not next week. Probably somewhere January, February,’” Hoda said during a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMl0Y4dMJCk">interview with Jimmy Fallon</a>.</p>



<p>“(They said) ‘January, February?’ I might as well continue working forever. For them, it’s like till the end.&#8221;</p>



<p>It might be happening later than they&#8217;d hoped, but it seems that Hope and Haley will finally get their wish!</p>

<p>And we&#8217;ve got new details about her last day on the job and her surprising reasons for quitting.</p>



<p>Yes, apparently, Hoda&#8217;s salary may have played a part in her stepping away.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1309651502-1024x640.jpg" alt="In this screengrab released on March 28, 2021, host Hoda Kotb speaks during the Movies for Grownups Awards with AARP the Magazine broadcast on March 28, 2021 by Great Performances on PBS.

<p>Though the talk show host and reporter has not addressed this report herself, the rumor floating around is that as the legacy anchor, she was denied one of the biggest perks in the game: more money. </p>



<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not the reason she&#8217;s giving for her departure; far from it, in fact. </p>



<p>But is it possible that negotiations over her pay for the next years on the air was at the heart of the issue? We&#8217;ve heard stranger things&#8230; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoda-s-decision-to-leave">Hoda&#8217;s Decision To Leave</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590-1024x683.jpg" alt="NBC anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb " class="wp-image-511504" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1436130590.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NBC anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb attend as Wynonna Judd performs on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; at Rockefeller Plaza on October 24, 2022 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hoda announced that she&#8217;d be stepping away from <em>Today </em>on September 26. She revealed her plans to leave the show after she turned 60 in August.</p>



<p>The talk show host announced that she&#8217;d be leaving in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAYdHKMRxB-/?img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo to staff</a>, which she also read on air. The show also shared the memo on social media. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m making the right decision, but it&#8217;s a painful one,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>Hoda Kotb then continued and looked back on the many different positions she held at NBC over the course of her career. She also gave shoutouts to her <em>Today </em>crew and family, including Al Roker and Jenna Bush Hager.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you and it&#8217;s time for me to leave the show,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;I will miss each and every one of you at <em>Today </em>desperately.&#8221; </p>



<p></p>



<p>Hoda then said that her 60th birthday celebration &#8220;felt like a shift.&#8221; Still, she said that she was &#8220;ready and excited&#8221; for the next chapter of her life.</p>



<p>&#8220;My broadcast career has been beyond meaningful, a new decade of my life lies ahead, and now my daughters and my mom need a bigger slice of my time pie,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>Hoda concluded by saying that she&#8217;d be working through the beginning of 2025. She also said that she&#8217;d &#8220;remain a part of the NBC family,&#8221; but she didn&#8217;t say what her role would be. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be around. How could I not? Family is family, and you all will always be a part of mine,&#8221; she concluded.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoda-s-last-day-on-today">Hoda&#8217;s Last Day on Today</h2>



<p>We now know that <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/when-is-hodas-last-day-with-today-and-who-is-replacing-her-what-to-know/3636244/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoda&#8217;s last day on <em>Today</em></a> will be January 10.</p>

<p>Hoda has maintained a civil facade during her final weeks on the job, and we&#8217;re she still gets along with her co-workers. </p>



<p>But she might be so fond of her NBC bosses at the moment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-hoda-kotb-s-salary">What Is Hoda Kotb&#8217;s Salary?</h2>



<p>While Hoda&#8217;s departure message implied that she was looking to spend more time with family, it was <a href="https://puck.news/what-hoda-kotbs-today-show-departure-means-for-the-star-anchor-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that money was a major factor in her decision by <em>Puck</em>. Sources close to the situation said that she was making over $20 million per year. </p>



<p>The outlet also noted that her co-anchor Savannah Guthrie also makes over $20 million, and former co-anchor Matt Lauer made $25 million. It was reported that cuts to the industry played a factor in the salary cut.</p>



<p>&#8220;NBC executives <em>loved </em>Hoda and knew her value to the brand, but also made clear to her agents that such stratospheric contracts were no longer justifiable given the industry’s inexorable decline,&#8221; <em>Puck</em> noted.</p>

<p><em>Puck </em>also explained that this type of &#8220;reset&#8221; is going to be far more common in TV. &#8220;Everyone is getting their pay cut or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-will-replace-hoda-kotb-on-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their jobs eliminated,</a>&#8221; a source said.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the coming year, some big names will announce they want to spend more time with their kids or families or write new chapters,&#8221; the insider told the site. &#8220;They also don’t want to work for less money even though they have already made a fortune.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-long-was-hoda-at-nbc">How Long Was Hoda at NBC?</h2>



<p>Hoda spent over a quarter of a century with NBC. In her social media post, she noted all the different roles that she had at the network over the 26 years that she worked there. </p>



<p>The journalist began working for NBC News in 1998. She was a correspondent for <em>Dateline</em>. Hoda joined <em>Today </em>in 2007. Kathie Lee Gifford joined her as a co-host in 2008, and she remained her co-host until 2019. Jenna Bush Hager took over for Kathie after that. </p>



<p>After Matt Lauer was fired in 2017 for sexual misconduct allegations, Savannah had a range of co-anchors with her. In 2018, Hoda was brought up to co-anchor alongside her, and they were the first pair of female anchors in the show&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>Hoda Kotb once faced workplace body-shaming. Now, she&#8217;s opening up about it.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/hoda-kotb-qutting-today-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoda is leaving</a> <em>The Today Show</em>, she still has time to drop some hard facts.</p>



<p>On the Monday, December 2 episode of the talk show, the TV news legend opened up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/who-will-replace-hoda-kotb-on-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to her co-host</a> about a former boss.</p>



<p>The unnamed individual body-shamed Hoda, suggesting that she use a &#8220;treadmill.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-someone-body-shame-hoda-kotb">Why did someone body-shame Hoda Kotb?</h2>



<p>On Monday&#8217;s episode of Today with Hoda and Jenna, titular hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager discussed how actor Timothee Chalamet&#8217;s career saw numerous delays over his body type.</p>



<p>Timmy, as his fans and admirers sometimes affectionately call him, has a slender body. Over the past dozen years, film and television have focused upon hypermuscular builds. </p>



<p>Some blame this on superhero films, but it extends to seemingly every genre. Too many networks and studios acting as if other body types, even traditionally attractive ones, are not worth showcasing. And yes, actors like Timothee have lost out on roles, while beefier actors transformed their bodies forever even for simple recurring TV roles.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-1024x669.jpg" alt="Timothee Chalamet on November 28, 2023." class="wp-image-514198" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-2048x1339.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-960x627.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1202_timotheechalamet_01-1200x784.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Timothee Chalamet attends the Warner Bros.

<p>This topic is how Hoda Kotb brought up that she, too, once had someone telling her that she was &#8220;not right for&#8221; her own job.</p>



<p>“I still remember I had just started working at a small market,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;And I played basketball in high school, so I always assumed I was in shape even though literally after college and stuff, I wasn’t.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hoda shared: “I still remember my boss going to me, ‘Hey, Hoda,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah?’ He goes, ‘Hey, I got an idea &#8212; maybe you might wanna try to get on the treadmill.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-like-the-rest-of-us-jenna-expressed-shock-at-the-body-shaming-of-hoda">Like the rest of us, Jenna expressed shock at the body-shaming of Hoda</h2>



<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Jenna Bush Hager exclaimed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Hoda acknowledged. “He said it like that, and I go, ‘What?’ Like, you know when you have a perception of yourself that is not the perception in the real world?”</p>



<p>Jenna chimed in that the guy must have had &#8220;reverse body dysmorphia.&#8221; Body dysmorphia is when someone has a distorted image of their own body. Jenna&#8217;s suggestion was that this boss was experiencing a sort of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/gypsy-rose-blanchard-misses-mom-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by-proxy</a> </em>version, where he had a warped view of <em>other</em> bodies. </p>

<p>“Yeah, so I was like, ‘What are you talking about?&#8217;” Hoda narrated. “But, if you don’t fit, they want you to wear something a certain way, cut your hair a certain way, speak a certain way.”</p>



<p>Though dialect is not the same as body-shaming, Jenna admitted that she had also been asked to avoid saying &#8220;y&#8217;all,&#8221; a folksy contraction of &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;all&#8221; most prevalent in the southern United States, when she began on <em>Today</em>.</p>



<p>However, she dropped the affect, admitting that she could not &#8220;pretend&#8221; to be a &#8220;serious news person.&#8221; Even if many of her colleagues are, in fact, very serious news people. Journalists, one might even call them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-start-losing-who-you-are">&#8216;You start losing who you are&#8217;</h2>



<p>Hoda clearly understood Jenna&#8217;s decision to speak in a manner that feels natural to her.</p>



<p>“I think you know when you’re pretending deep down and no matter what it is, you start losing who you are,” she wisely opined.</p>



<p>Though Hoda did allow that there are  “sometimes” areas where people have to change to “fit into a work environment.”</p>

She had to smooth things over, as she had a cohost &#8212; but not the one that she had expected.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: NBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, there&#8217;s no indication that Hoda was describing anyone at NBC. In fact, she has only worked for NBC for the past 26 years. </p>



<p>After her Virginia Tech graduation in 1986, Hoda Kotb worked at a local CBS affiliate in Mississippi. The &#8217;80s were, believe it or not, an even crueler time to be a woman in many ways than the 2020s are. Even if American women arguably had more rights when Hoda graduated college than they do now.</p>



<p>Whether the workplace body-shaming that she describes took place there or elsewhere is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had a couple weeks now to let the news sink in: <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/hoda-kotb-qutting-today-show/">Hoda Kotb is leaving &#8216;The Today Show</a>&#8216;.</p>



<p>After 17 years, the co-host stunned viewers on September 26 by sharing the surprising new:</p>



<p>“I realized that it was time for me to turn the page at 60, and to try something new.&#8221;</p>



<p>While we applaud Hoda for knowing her own mind and for coming to a decision that benefits her and her family, the race is now on to see who will be filling her shoes on the Today Show panel. </p>



<p>Since she made her announcement, everyone has weighed in on the topic, from longtime fans to studio execs &#8211; to Hoda herself! </p>



<p>Who will replace Hoda on <em>The Today Show</em>? Well, now we know. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-re-on-craig">You&#8217;re on, Craig!</h2>



<p>Craig Melvin&nbsp;step into Hoda&#8217;s shoes on  “Today” and lead the show into tomorrow.</p>



<p>The longtime NBC News journalist has spent  years anchoring and co-anchoring on MSNBC and as well as on The Today Show. In fact, since 2018, he&#8217;s been co-anchoring the show’s 9 a.m. hour, typically known as the &#8220;3rd hour.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, he will step up to co-host the flagship 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. hours of “Today,” alongside Savannah Guthrie.</p>



<p>However, NBC has yet to announce a fill-in for Kotb’s other role, co-anchoring the 10 a.m. hour, which she does with Jenna Bush Hager and which is focused more on lifestyle topics. But there are still some ideas for that. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513281" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1487384175.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dylan Dreyer, Sheinelle Jones, Al Roker, Hoda Kotb and Craig Melvin attend the 2023 Broadcasting + Cable Hall Of Fame Gala at The Ziegfeld Ballroom on May 03, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-other-frontrunner">The Other Frontrunner </h2>



<p>There were other names tossed around before the network landed on Craig. </p>



<p>“The big contender who everyone at the network is talking about is <strong>Laura Jarrett</strong> &#8212; she has a really strong chance,” an <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/who-will-replace-hoda-kotb-on-the-today-show-nbc-insider-explains/">NBC insider has told</a> Us Weekly. </p>



<p>“She’s the anchor of Weekend Today; she is a lawyer like [Kotb’s coanchor] Savannah [Guthrie]. She’s a darling at the Today show who has risen up very quickly.“</p>



<p>Laura is 40 years old and her mother, Valerie Jarrett, served as Barack Obama’s senior advisor during his administration.</p>



<p>She replaced Kristen Welker as co-anchor of Today Show’s Saturday coverage in September 2023.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hiring-from-within">Hiring From Within</h2>



<p>Other options also work for NBC these days.</p>



<p>Obviously, they went with <strong>Craig Melvin</strong>, but they could&#8217;ve just as easily went with  <strong>Carson Daly</strong>, according to this same source.</p>



<p>“The other option is they could move around anchors,” the insider explains. “They could put Craig with Savannah, or they could put [3rd Hour Today cohost] Sheneille [Jones] with Savannah.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also heard buzz around these parts about Political and National correspondent <strong>Jacob Soboroff</strong>, along with NBC News Now anchor <strong>Tom Llamas</strong>.</p>



<p>Both of these personalities are considered rising stars &#8212; and executives are aware that Al Roker, Lester Holt and Dateline’s Keith Morrison all may retire in the near future.</p>

<p>For her part, Meteorologist <strong>Dylan Dreyer</strong> spoke to E! News and was asked to forecast who might fill Today’s soon-to-be empty anchor chair.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t think if they named anyone in our core group of people it would be surprising,&#8221; she told to Keltie Knight at the 2024 People’s Choice Country Awards, keeping things diplomatic and adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;We’ve all filled in along the way when somebody’s out. I don’t know if anybody’s made any decisions yet, but if it’s one of the core group, I really don’t think it’s that surprising.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fan-favorite-choice">The Fan-Favorite Choice</h2>



<p>While it makes perfect sense to promote from within, there are of course many, many other options to consider outside the studio.</p>



<p>And even some who have already auditioned live and have sparked fan favor with their appearances. </p>



<p>Enter Snoop Dogg to the chat.</p>



<p>On October 17, Snoop joined Hoda and Jenna to co-host the morning show and the reaction was electric! </p>



<p>Fans immediately began singing the praises of the &#8220;Drop It Like It&#8217;s Hot&#8221; rapper, and actually started to speculate how awesome it would be if he replaced Hoda on Today. </p>



<p>&#8220;Well, now that Hoda is leaving the show, her only [replacement] can be Snoop ,&#8221; suggested a fan on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510237" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2174952758-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hoda Kotb greets audience members during Chris Stapleton&#8217;s performance on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; at Rockefeller Plaza on September 27, 2024 in New York City.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoda-reflects-on-her-next-chapter">Hoda Reflects On Her Next Chapter</h2>



<p>When she made the announcement, Hoda referenced her young children, making it clear she needed to spend more time with her five and seven-year old.</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously I had my kiddos late in life, and I was thinking that they deserve a bigger piece of my time pie that I have.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like we only have a finite amount of time. And so, with all that being said, this is the hardest thing in the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perfectly understandable, of course.</p>



<p>Now, Hoda will remain behind the Today Show desk until January 1 and will then remain within the &#8220;NBC family&#8221; in some capacity.</p>



<p>In an October 9 interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://people.com/hoda-kotb-opens-up-about-leaving-today-for-her-kids-exclusive-8724870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>People</em></a>, Kotb gave the perfect advice for the person who takes on the role when she’s gone. “Whoever’s interested in that seat, and it’s maybe the best seat in television, I think the best advice I have is to be 1,000% who you are, because that’s really the key,” Kotb said.</p>



<p>“And the other thing, too, is sometimes to me, part of the magic is to be able to delight in the person sitting next to you,” she added. “It’s such a small thing, but sometimes when you’re with someone, if you just let them shine. Give everyone a second, because who wants to be the person at the cocktail party who’s talking all the time?”</p>

<p>Kevin Costner&#8217;s love life has certainly been a hot topic lately! Ok, not as big of a topic as his departure from <em>Yellowstone</em>, but we&#8217;re trying to be in the present, ok?</p>



<p>Any way, over the years, Kevin Costner&#8217;s relationships have garnered much media attention. While the <em>Field of Dreams </em>star has had two long-term marriages, his last one ended in shambles. </p>



<p>Following a widely-covered divorce from Christine Baumgartner, Kevin was rumored to be dating folk-pop singer Jewel. While he did<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/kevin-costner-jewel-relationship-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> set the record straight</a> on whether or not they&#8217;re dating in a June interview, it was just the start of rumors he&#8217;s been racking up lovers. </p>



<p>Like, have you heard the one about him at Hoda Kotb?!</p>



<p>As the latest season of <em>Yellowstone</em> is set to premiers on November 10, 2024, fans are not only eagerly awaiting the next part of the western,  but to know what&#8217;s going on in Costner&#8217;s romantic life. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-costner-girlfriend-rumors-since-his-divorce">Kevin Costner Girlfriend Rumors Since His Divorce </h2>



<p>Romance rumors about Jewel and Kevin began to circulate in December 2023. <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/08/kevin-costner-jewel-dating-divorce-vacation-caribbean-necker-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Photos</a> of the two of them getting very close circulated via <em>TMZ. </em></p>



<p>Kevin was attending a fundraiser for Jewel&#8217;s Inspiring Children Foundation, and a photo of him with his arms around Jewel surfaced. An insider claimed that it seemed like there was some chemistry.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was definitely something going on. They were flirty, and when they were together, it was like they both just lit up,&#8221; the source said. </p>



<p>Despite some rumors, Kevin set the record straight during a June 2024 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcZ7W0Okm1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> on <em>The Howard Stern Show</em>. &#8220;Jewel and I are friends — we’ve never gone out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don’t want these rumors to ruin our friendship because that’s what we have.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though they&#8217;re not dating, the <em>Bull Durham </em>star did admit that he thought that Jewel is &#8220;special,&#8221; and it&#8217;s clear that he values her friendship.</p>



<p>Another rumor has circulated with many fans wanting to see Kevin <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/hoda-kotb-and-kevin-costner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end up with Hoda Kotb</a>. The actor did praise the anchor, saying she has &#8220;a spark&#8221; in a recent interview. </p>



<p>Hoda&#8217;s co-anchor Jenna Bush-Hager has admitted that some fans have encouraged her to setup the two of them. Hoda split from an eight-year romance in 2022.</p>



<p>A source close to the situation told <em>Closer Weekly</em> that Kevin was considering making a move on the <em>Today </em>host. &#8220;With his bitter split behind him, Kevin’s made it known that he’s back on the hunt for a new romantic partner,&#8221; they told the outlet in an October <a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/kevin-costner-has-his-sights-on-hoda-kotb-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. &#8220;And he’s made it pretty clear his sights have zoomed in on also available Hoda.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-past-exes">His Past Exes</h2>



<p>While Kevin and Jewel may not be an item, the actor has had a few public romances in the past. His first marriage was to his college sweetheart Cindy Silva in 1978. The pair had two daughters Annie and Lily as well as a son Joe. After 16 years of marriage, the couple divorced in 1994.</p>



<p>After the split, Kevin was briefly with Bridget Rooney, whom he shares a son Liam with.</p>



<p>A decade after his divorce from Cindy, Kevin married model and handbag designer Christine Baumgartner. The pair have sons Cayden and Hayes, as well as daughter Grace. In May 2023, Christine filed for divorce after 19 years.</p>



<p>After Christine filed for divorce, many fans started speculating as to why they broke up. Some people theorized that Kevin&#8217;s continued involvement in <em>Yellowstone </em>may have had a hand in their split. </p>



<p>Throughout<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kevin-costner-divorce-marriage-christine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the divorce,</a> the former couple also had to sort out some money issues. There were some disputes about money, and Kevin reportedly reduced her credit card limit. </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, Kevin and Christine also had some back-and-forth about child support. The pair also had disputes about their marital home. The pair eventually <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/kevin-costner-ex-wives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized their divorce </a>in February 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-kevin-costner-looking-for-in-a-girlfriend-today">What Is Kevin Costner Looking For in a Girlfriend Today?</h2>



<p>Bottom line, unless he has a mystery woman on the side, it looks like Kevin is available. </p>



<p>And since Kevin is single, he did open up about what his ideal partner would be in a June 2024 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/horizon-star-kevin-costner-reveals-what-looking-next-romance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with<em> Fox News Digital</em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;A person who wants to be loved, and they want to be, you know … feel like they&#8217;re at their very best. And that love helps that and doesn&#8217;t hinder it,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t sound like a huge ask. Hope he finds that for himself. </p>



<p>Heck, we hope everyone finds that if they want it! </p>

<p>Hoda Kotb is outta there, folks.</p>



<p>Or she will be pretty soon at least.</p>



<p>On Thursday morning, the long-time television personality stunned viewers by saying she has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/hoda-kotb-qutting-today-show/">decided to leave The TODAY Show</a>, effective on January 1, 2025.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="717" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/hoda-kotb-leaving-mc-240926-01-3471d9-copy-1024x717.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510141" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/hoda-kotb-leaving-mc-240926-01-3471d9-copy-1024x717.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/hoda-kotb-leaving-mc-240926-01-3471d9-copy-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/hoda-kotb-leaving-mc-240926-01-3471d9-copy-768x538.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/hoda-kotb-leaving-mc-240926-01-3471d9-copy-960x673.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/hoda-kotb-leaving-mc-240926-01-3471d9-copy.jpg 1072w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hoda Kotb announces here that she is leaving the TODAY show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Nathan Congleton / TODAY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I realized that it was time for me to turn the page at 60, and to try something new,&#8221; Kotb said on air. </p>



<p>&#8220;I remembered standing outside looking at these beautiful bunch of people with these gorgeous signs, and I thought, &#8216;This is what the top of the wave feels like for me.&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;And I thought it can&#8217;t get better, and I decided that this is the right time for me to kind of move on.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, Kotb celebrated this milestone birthday in August &#8212; and explained how the occasion inspired the decision she has now finally arrived at.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="911" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-911x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510142" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-911x1024.jpg 911w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-267x300.jpg 267w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-768x864.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-1821x2048.jpg 1821w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-854x960.jpg 854w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-960x1080.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170882258-1067x1200.jpg 1067w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hoda Kotb attends the 2024 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 8, 2024 in New York City.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by John Nacion/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is what she said:</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought about &#8212; obviously, I had my kiddos late in life &#8212; and I was thinking they deserve a bigger piece of my time, the pie that I have. I feel like we only have a finite amount of time. And so, with all that being said, this is the hardest thing in the world. </p>



<p>Kotb shares daughters Haley, 7, and Hope, 5, with her ex-fiancé, Joel Schiffman.</p>



<p>The co-host will remain a part of the &#8220;NBC family&#8221; going forward, Kotb emphasized, but not in the kind of regular capacity she&#8217;s enjoyed for the past 17 years on TODAY.</p>

Hekimian/Getty Images for LVMH x Vogue x NBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the wake of this news, Kotb&#8217;s colleagues responded with statement of gratitude, surprise admiration and a little bit of sorrow.</p>



<p>“Hoda, we love you so much, and when you look around and you see these tears, they’re love. You are so loved. And honestly, I don’t think any of us can imagine — we don’t want to imagine this place without you,” <strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong> said through tears. </p>



<p>“So, it’s complicated ‘cause we love you so much and we don’t want you to ever go.”</p>



<p>To her friend, she added:</p>



<p>“You have guts. For someone to leave at the top of their game, to leave something that’s wonderful, that you love, where it’s easy and comfortable and beautiful and fun and say, ‘But I dream even bigger for myself…’ You have so much guts. You inspire me. I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said <strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong>:</p>



<p>“Hoda told me just a couple days ago, and when she told me, my first reaction was from my gut and it was almost crazy. … I said, ‘No, you can’t leave.&#8217;</p>



<p>“You’re who I come to when I’m feeling joyful, when I’m feeling unsure. You are who I come to and you believed in me first,” she continued. “We have a lot of bosses ad I love them, but this lady, on October 28, 2013 — I looked it up — said, ‘Hey, wanna come sit next to me? There’s room.’”</p>



<p>Then there was this from Sheinelle Jones:</p>



<p>“The one thing that people know for sure about this group is we are family. And I’m telling you, Hoda has a relationship with every single person on this couch in her own way, so I think we’re all just kind of wrestling with it inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;But we also know what a dynamic mom you are, and presence you are. And your whole movement with wellness. You are going to change the world. </p>



<p>&#8220;And we know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And <strong>Al Roker</strong>:</p>



<p>“I have never known anybody like you. I’ve known you forever, and I love you&#8230;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll give the last, emotional word to <strong>Craig Melvin</strong>:</p>



<p>“People in this business, when that little red light, when it goes off, they’re different people. We’ve worked with all these people before. You’re the opposite.</p>



<p>&#8220;When that little red light goes off, you are exactly like people see you in the morning — just the biggest heart. You’ve been the heart of the show for a long time, and there’s no replacing that&#8230;</p>



<p>“It is sad news for us, great news for Hope and Haley.”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the end of an era at NBC&#8217;s <em>Today</em>. Beloved host <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/hoda-kotb-and-kevin-costner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoda Kotb</a> has announced that her time on the show will soon come to an end.</p>



<p>Hoda shared the surprising news during an emotional segment on this morning&#8217;s broadcast.</p>



<p>&#8220;I realized that it was time for me to turn the page at 60, and to try something new,&#8221; she said. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoda-kotb-recalls-moment-she-decided-to-step-down">Hoda Kotb Recalls Moment She Decided to Step Down</h2>



<p>Hoda says she made the decision to step away from television (at least for now) on her 60th birthday in August.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remembered standing outside looking at these beautiful bunch of people with these gorgeous signs. And I thought, &#8216;This is what the top of the wave feels like for me,'&#8221; <a href="https://www.today.com/news/hoda-kotb-leaving-today-show-rcna172812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she said</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I thought it can&#8217;t get better, and I decided that this is the right time for me to kind of move on.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hoda explained that she&#8217;s motivated primarily by her decision to spend more time with her daughters, Haley, 7, and Hope, 5.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obviously I had my kiddos late in life, and I was thinking that they deserve a bigger piece of my time pie that I have,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like we only have a finite amount of time. And so, with all that being said, this is the hardest thing in the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hoda revealed that she will continue anchoring <em>Today</em> with co-host <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/savannah-guthrie/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Savannah Guthrie</a> until January 1, 2025.</p>



<p>She says she will then remain with NBC News in a role that has yet to be specified.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of a big deal for me,&#8221; Hoda tearfully continued. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been practicing so I wouldn&#8217;t cry, but anyway, I did.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hoda-s-history">Hoda&#8217;s History</h2>



<p>After starting her NBC career at <em>Dateline</em> in the late &#8217;90s, Hoda has spent 16 years co-hosting the fourth hour of <em>Today</em>, first with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/12/kathie-lee-gifford-stuns-viewers-confirms-depature-from-the-toda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathie Lee Gifford</a> and then with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/01/jenna-bush-hager-apologizes-for-golden-globes-gaffe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Bush Hager</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2017, she&#8217;s co-anchored the first hour of <em>Today</em>, a role she&#8217;s shared with Guthrie since 2018.</p>

<p>Kotb also shared a heartfelt letter that she penned to her <em>Today</em> colleagues ahead of this morning&#8217;s announcement:</p>



<p>&#8220;As I write this, my heart is all over the map. I know I&#8217;m making the right decision, but it&#8217;s a painful one. And you all are the reason why,&#8221; Hoda wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;They say two things can be right at the same time, and I&#8217;m feeling that so deeply right now. I love you and it&#8217;s time for me to leave the show.</p>

<p>&#8220;My time at NBC has been the longest professional love affair of my life. But only because you&#8217;ve been beside me on this twenty-six-year adventure.&#8221;</p>



<p>We know we speak for millions of <em>Today</em> viewers when we say Hoda will be greatly missed.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see what awaits her in this exciting new stage of her life.</p>

<p>Should Hoda Kotb and Kevin Costner date?</p>



<p>There has been plenty of speculation about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/kevin-costner-jewel-relationship-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Costner&#8217;s dating life</a> in the wake of his high-profile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/kevin-costner-ex-christine-baumgartner-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contentious divorce</a>.</p>



<p>But viewers of the <em>TODAY </em>show seem more interested in his future romance options.</p>



<p>Citing an apparent crush by host Hoda Kotb, they&#8217;re totally shipping her with Costner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-are-shipping-hoda-kotb-and-kevin-costner">Fans are shipping Hoda Kotb and Kevin Costner</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, July 9, Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie appeared as guests on <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>. You can view that clip for yourself, below.</p>



<p>One of the viewers who called in asked Hoda how she feels about the world (or, at least, a significant portion of the Today audience) shipping her with Kevin Costner.</p>



<p>Sparks, these fans observed, seemed to fly between Hoda and Costner during their interview in June. And, well, a lot of fans think that the two could really connect on a less professional level.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/BravoWWHL/status/1810862757341774318
</div></figure>



<p>News of fans feeling this way came as a clear shock to Hoda.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait what?,&#8221; she asked alongside some nervous laughter. &#8220;I have never ever heard that, not one time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Andy Cohen was sure to explain for the chronologically challenged that <em>shipping </em>means that viewers want Hoda and Costner together. The term <em>ship</em> in this context stems from <em>relationship</em>. This specific phrasing first emerged in the <em>X-Files</em> fandom in the 1990s, eventually breaking containment from fanfiction circles as people apply it to real-life (potential) couples.</p>

<p>Obviously, Andy (and fans) were putting Hoda on the spot with regards to this possible Kevin Costner pairing. But she handled it well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if the viewers want it,&#8221; Hoda quipped, looking into the camera.</p>



<p>Savannah Guthrie chimed in: &#8220;Give the people what they want!&#8221; That&#8217;s all very cute &#8230; and was not the end of it.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, July 10, <em>Today With Hoda and Jenna </em>continued the conversation, with Jenna Bush Hager bringing up the <em>WWHL </em>moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;I actually did know because people were coming up to me on the street, and people were like, &#8216;You should set up Hoda and Kevin Costner,'&#8221; Jenna revealed.</p>



<p>She then joked: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know they were flirting behind my back.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-today-had-a-little-prank-in-store-for-hoda-kotb">&#8216;Today&#8217; had a little prank in store for Hoda Kotb</h2>



<p>Producers for the show ran an edit of Hoda Kotb and Kevin Costner from their still-fairly-recent interview.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, the video is suggestive &#8212; set to slow, romantic music, making it seem that Hoda and Costner were flirting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;all are ridiculous,&#8221; Hoda declared accurately with a laugh. &#8220;The slow-mo&#8217; and the music, really?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/HodaAndJenna/status/1811053302823481374
</div></figure>



<p>As anyone who has found out that people &#8220;ship&#8221; them with a close friend or colleague can attest, this can be an awkward situation. Sometimes, like Hoda, all that you can do is giggle.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t think that Hoda intends to become another of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/kevin-costner-ex-wives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Costner&#8217;s famous ex-wives</a>. It&#8217;s just funny to talk about &#8212; so long as no one takes the joke too far.</p>



<p>There is <em>some </em>peril when it comes to fans obsessing over celebrities (and wanting them to kiss). But so long as everyone can behave themselves, the laugh-inducing <em>Today </em>show edits are harmless and pretty funny.</p>

<p>As Hoda Kotb breaks her silence on Kelly Rowland&#8217;s vanishing act, <em>Today Show</em> viewers are trying to make sense of the guest host drama.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jennifer-lopez-retiring-final-album-this-is-me-now-amazon-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez teases an end to her music career</a> after releasing a wildly indulgent autobiographical movie, she is of course making the rounds and doing interviews.</p>



<p>J. Lo being who she is, she apparently made sure that she had the best dressing room for her <em>Today Show</em> interview.</p>



<p>Too nice, it seems. Kelly Rowland walked out of a guest hosting gig, leaving NBC scrambling to fill in. What happened?</p>

<p>On Thursday, Rita Ora was Hoda Kotb&#8217;s cohost on NBC&#8217;s <em>Today Show</em>. By all accounts, she did a bang-up job.</p>



<p>But she was not the guest host whom Hoda, or the network, had expected.</p>



<p>Rita Ora had been lined up as a regular guest. Kelly Rowland, on the other hand, was going to be a guest host &#8230; until mere minutes before the broadcast.</p>

<p>Neither Hoda nor Rita attempted to conceal the fact that Rita had only learned that she was filling in for Hoda minutes before airtime.</p>



<p>Then, reports dished that <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/02/20/entertainment/hoda-kotb-addresses-kelly-rowlands-today-show-walk-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Rowland had walked out</a> of her <em>Today Show</em> guest hosting gig  over the dressing room situation.</p>



<p>“Kelly and her team were not happy. They did not like the dressing room, so they decided to pull her off the show, leaving [Kotb] without a guest host for the 10 a.m. hour,” an inside source told <em>Page Six</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-kelly-rowland-back-out-of-guest-hosting">Why did Kelly Rowland back out of guest hosting?</h2>



<p>Apparently, Kelly Rowland had already played a few rounds of &#8220;musical dressing rooms&#8221; while trying to find a satisfactory room.</p>



<p>According to the insider, this &#8220;made no sense&#8221; to the NBC employees at 30 Rockefeller Plaza because the singer is &#8220;beloved at <em>Today</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is unclear what about the dressing rooms did not meet her standards &#8230; except that, reportedly, she couldn&#8217;t find one as nice as Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s. Kelly Rowland has not personally commented on what happened &#8212; not in public, anyway. Not yet.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rita Ora has seemingly confirmed the reports about Rowland&#8217;s motives.</p>



<p>She herself has commented that everyone was &#8220;so lovely and kind.&#8221; It is good to hear that everyone was courteous to her, after she so graciously filled in at the last minute.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, February 20, Hoda Kotb spoke up &#8212; finally breaking her silence on what happened last week.</p>

<p>“I just want to say this: I have great love and admiration for Kelly Rowland,&#8221; she expressed on Tuesday.</p>



<p>&#8220;I adore her, and I want her to come back on our show, and I want her to host again,” she then emphasized.</p>



<p>Even her regular fellow host, Jenna Bush Hager, chimed in to note that Rowland is &#8220;welcome any time.&#8221; She added that &#8220;she&#8217;s the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Of course she is, of course she is! She can share my dressing room,&#8221; Kotb noted. &#8220;We’ll be in it together!”</p>



<p>She said this while laughing &#8212; and, seemingly, while confirming reports that Rowland had left over dressing room issues.</p>



<p>“But anyway, I just want to say we love her. We’ve loved her on this show for many, many years,” Kotb then very affirmingly reiterated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sherri Shepherd wrote on social media &#8212; in response to a snarky comment &#8212; that &#8220;of course&#8221; her own show gave Kelly Rowland a &#8220;gorgeous room.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shepherd&#8217;s comment was not snarky or sarcastic. She filled with with heart and fire emojis to convey her sincerity.</p>



<p>Apparently, Kelly Rowland isn&#8217;t that difficult to please. Unless something else was going on, and it wasn&#8217;t really about dressing rooms.</p>
