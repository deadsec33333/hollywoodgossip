<p>Adele is ready to set fire to the screen! The British songstress&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/adele-cancels-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas residency </a>may be done, but she&#8217;s reportedly planning on releasing a concert film, documenting the shows.</p>



<p>The popstar&#8217;s &#8220;Weekends With Adele&#8221; concert series was<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/adele-lying-to-fans-about-canceled-vegas-residency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> one of the hottest tickets </a>in Sin City for two years, and now all of her fans will get to experience the magic.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an excellent decision for Adele to turn her recent concerts into a film and documentary. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/adeles-replacing-katy-perry-on-american-idol-rumor-has-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fellow popstars </a>Taylor Swift and Beyonce had hit films with their <em>Eras Tour </em>and <em>Renaissance </em>films, respectively.</p>

<p>While the &#8220;Someone Like You&#8221; singer has not shared any details about the film herself yet, here&#8217;s everything we know about the movie!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-adele-said-about-the-concert-film">What Has Adele Said About The Concert Film?</h2>



<p>Adele first shared the exciting news that she&#8217;d record her shows back in March of 2023. The singer told the crowd at one of her concerts that she&#8217;d booked some summer dates.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll be back for a few weeks in June, and I’m gonna film it and I’m gonna release it to make sure that anyone who wants to see this show can see it,&#8221; she said, per <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-extend-weekends-with-las-vegas-residency-release-concert-film-1234703875/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rolling Stone</em>. </a></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="747" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1406473123-747x1024.jpg" alt="Adele performs on stage as American Express present BST Hyde Park in Hyde Park on July 02, 2022 in London, England.

<p>Before announcing the film, Adele admitted &#8220;playing to 4,000 people for 34 nights is not enough.&#8221; She knew fans would want to see more.</p>



<p>While the fans who couldn&#8217;t make the shows are certainly excited, sources close to the singer also noted that she&#8217;s probably going to make a pretty penny off the movie.</p>



<p>An insider closer to the situation reported that Adele would likely earn about $60 million from the movie, according to<em> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/adele-rolling-cash-mega-film-30253934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Adele&#8217;s Vegas shows are not just a massive success critically and with fans, but also financially. And the film special is also going to bring in millions more &#8211; a sum greater than the show payments,&#8221; the source told the outlet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-songs-will-be-in-the-movie">What Songs Will Be In The Movie?</h2>



<p>The film hasn&#8217;t officially been announced yet, so the songs that will be featured are still not clear. The film will likely feature the standard setlist from most of the shows, although Adele did occasionally change things up.</p>



<p>The movie will reportedly be both a concert film and part documentary. It&#8217;s not clear what behind-the-scenes details or new insights Adele will have as part of the documentary.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Adele has announced a <a href="https://shop.adele.com/products/weekends-with-adele-live-in-las-vegas-box-set" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live album</a> from the concerts, which will be released in February. The three LP vinyl box set boasts 21 songs from the singer&#8217;s residency, and it seems likely that it will be a similar setlist for the movie.</p>



<p>The tracklist is as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hello</li>



<li>Easy On Me</li>



<li>Turning Tables</li>



<li>Take It All</li>



<li>I Drink Wine</li>



<li>Water Under the Bridge</li>



<li>Send My Love (To Your New Lover)</li>



<li>Oh My God</li>



<li>One and Only</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t You Remember</li>



<li>Rumour Has It</li>



<li>Skyfall</li>



<li>Hometown Glory</li>



<li>Love In The Dark</li>



<li>Cry Your Heart Out</li>



<li>Set Fire To The Rain</li>



<li>When We Were Young</li>



<li>Hold On</li>



<li>Someone Like You</li>



<li>Rolling In The Deep</li>



<li>Love Is A Game</li>
</ol>

<p>Adele has not yet given a release date for the film. Her live album <em>Weekends With Adele Live In Las Vegas </em>is expected to be released in February, but it&#8217;s not clear if the film will coincide with the album.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adele-s-previous-concert-films">Adele&#8217;s Previous Concert Films</h2>



<p>This will be Adele&#8217;s fifth concert recording. In 2011, she released the concert film and live album <em>Live At The Royal Albert Hall</em>. </p>

<p>&#8220;It just feels so one on one. I really have loved coming here every weekend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adele is ready for another baby, so she&#8217;s looking to get pregnant right away!</p>



<p>Since becoming a mother, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/10/adele-claps-back-at-body-shamers-stop-being-weird-about-my-weigh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adele has undergone major changes</a>. </p>



<p>But even with her monumental music career, she continues to treasure motherhood. And she&#8217;d like to have another child.</p>



<p>She has very specific ideas about what she&#8217;d like for baby #2.</p>

<p>After &#8220;Weekends With Adele&#8221; wraps, <em>The Daily Mail</em> reports, she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13436453/Adele-reveals-major-plans-future-tells-fans-Vegas-residency-wants-baby-girl-husband-Rich-Paul.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going to focus</a> upon priorities closer to home.</p>



<p>On Friday, May 17, Adele told her audience directly that Baby #2 is her new goal.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="700" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-1024x700.jpg" alt="Adele in February of 2023." class="wp-image-500248" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-768x525.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-2048x1399.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-960x656.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-1080x738.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_02-1200x820.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Adele poses with the Best Pop Solo Performance Award for &#8220;Easy on Me&#8221; in the press room during the 65th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 05, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Alberto E.

<p>“Once I am done with all my obligations and all of my shows, I want to have a baby,” Adele told her audience.</p>



<p>“I want a girl because I’ve already got a boy,&#8221; Adele shared. Her son, Angelo, is 11. </p>



<p>She shares Angelo with her ex-husband, Simon Konecki.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-already-adele-is-imagining-what-her-baby-girl-might-be-like">Already, Adele is Imagining What Her Baby Girl Might Be Like</h2>



<p>&#8220;I feel like she might be like the person I love the most in the world, but also probably hate the most in the world,&#8221; Adele oddly stated.</p>



<p>&#8220;That is what I feel will happen,&#8221; she mused. &#8220;She’s going to put me in my place all the time, isn’t she?”</p>



<p>Adele then referred to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/adele-goes-instagram-official-with-boyfriend-rich-paul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boyfriend Rich Paul</a>, adding: “With me as her mother and Rich as her father, she’s going to be a bossy little queen, isn’t she?”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="703" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-1024x703.jpg" alt="Adele adorned by two pride flags in July of 2022." class="wp-image-500250" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-1024x703.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-300x206.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-768x528.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-2048x1407.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-960x659.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-1080x742.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_adele_04-1200x824.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Adele performs on stage as American Express present BST Hyde Park in Hyde Park on July 02, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for Adele)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Notably, Rich Paul is already a parent. His daughter&#8217;s name is Reonna Simone. Reonna has just graduated from Clark Atlanta University.</p>



<p>“It is my stepdaughter’s graduation this weekend,” Adele announced during another portion of the same Friday show. &#8220;So, I love you darling.&#8221;</p>



<p>Adele and Rich Paul have been in a relationship since 2021. Clearly, this has given them time to get to know each other, get to know each other&#8217;s children, and envision a future with a shared child.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adele-desperate-to-be-pregnant-again">Adele Desperate To Be Pregnant Again</h2>



<p>Getting pregnant with another kid has been on Adele&#8217;s &#8216;to do&#8217; list for quite some time now. </p>



<p>In August of 2023, Adele told fans that she felt &#8220;ready to be a mom again soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I’ve actually been writing lists,&#8221; she admitted at the time. &#8220;So every time I see a name that I like, I write it down in my phone.”</p>



<p>That is such a smart way to go about picking a baby name. Just be sure to look up what they all mean, and if anyone famous shares that name. Sometimes, there are some unfortunate coincidences.</p>

<p>The 2022 Grammy nominations were announced on Tuesday, and it seems there are some very interesting storylines that will play out at this year&#8217;s ceremony.</p>



<p>For one, we have another heavyweight bout between<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/04/adele-rocks-out-to-beyonce-see-her-beychella-dance/"> Beyonce and Adele</a>, who will once again square off in the record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year categories.</p>



<p>Of course, Beyonce is already the year&#8217;s big winner, having now tied her husband Jay-Z as the artist with the most career Grammy nominations of all-time.</p>



<p>Those Carters certainly know how to keep success in the family!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>This is a still image from Jay-Z and Beyonce&#8217;s joint music video. It dropped in June of 2018.</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list of nominees, you&#8217;ll find Viola Davis, who &#8212; with a win in the best audio book category for her memoir <em>Finding Me </em>&#8212; would join the prestigious EGOT club.</p>



<p>(The term applies to the short list of entertainers who have have received an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. Davis already has the other three trophies on her mantel.)</p>



<p>Keep scrolling for a full list of nominees in this year&#8217;s major categories:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Adele is one of those rare celebrities who seems to have mastered the art of public life.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s one of the most famous people on the planet, and yet her name rarely turns up in gossip columns.</p>
<p>Sure, some rumors bounced around social media amid the singer&#8217;s <a href="/2019/09/adele-files-for-divorce-from-simon-konecki/">divorce from Simon Konecki</a>, but they were mostly sympathetic, and the majority of the speculation centered around the extent to which Adele would channel her heartbreak into songs for her next album.</p>
<p>So the pop icon is in somewhat of an unfamiliar position this week, as she stands accused of misleading fans with a tearful message about the postponement of her long-awaited Las Vegas residency.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Worse, Adele &#8212; long beloved by fans for her plainspoken, down-to-earth persona &#8212; is being accused of engaging in diva-like behavior and antagonizing a well-regarded employee.</p>
<p>The trouble began on Thursday, when she posted a video in which she issued a tearful apology to fans and explained that her string of residency performances &#8212; which was set to begin on January 21 &#8212; has been postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m so sorry but &mdash; my show ain&#8217;t ready,&quot; Adele told fans in a video message.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;ve tried absolutely everything that we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you. But we&#8217;ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Half my crew and half my team are down with Covid &#8212; they still are &#8212; and it&#8217;s been impossible to finish the show,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#8217;t give you what I have right now, and I&#8217;m gutted. I&#8217;m gutted and I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s so last minute. We&#8217;ve been awake for over 30 hours now trying to figure it out, and we&#8217;ve run out of time.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>An emotional Adele closed out the video with a heartfelt apology to fans who had traveled from all over the world to see her perform.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m so upset and I&#8217;m really embarrassed, and I&#8217;m so sorry to everyone that&#8217;s traveled again,&quot; she said, possibly in reference to the canceled shows from her previous tour.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m really, really sorry. I&#8217;m really sorry.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But according to a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/17410189/adele-concerts-explosive-rows/">new report</a> from UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>, Adele did not offer a truthful explanation for why the show could not go on.</p>
<p>Insiders tell the outlet that for the past several weeks, the residency has been &ldquo;heading for disaster&rdquo; amid the singer&rsquo;s &ldquo;explosive arguments&rdquo; with her set designer, Esmerelda Devlin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of the set costing millions to put together, Adele was unhappy with the result, and she made her feelings very clear to Es,&rdquo; the source says.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;She [Adele] was already nervous and the falling out sent her spiraling into a panic because she was desperate that everything should be perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another source claims that Adele demanded &ldquo;endless changes&rdquo; to the set list and running order, putting major stress on Devlin at a late stage in the planning process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no real clarity around what Adele wanted for the show because of the endless changes being made to the production,&rdquo; the insider says.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed that while she has always preferred a stripped-back performance, she was under some pressure to come up with a huge extravaganza,&quot; the source continues.</p>
<p>&quot;So there was a constant ricochet between those two versions of what the show should be, and it did cause some quite explosive arguments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insider adds that Adele is aware that her perfectionist tendencies have caused problems in the past, but she&#8217;s unable to control them.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that Adele suffers badly with anxiety when it comes to performing live, so it&rsquo;s hard to imagine her going ahead if she wasn&rsquo;t happy,&rdquo; the source claims.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Grammy winner and her team will be able to sort things out soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we&#8217;re sure Adele&#8217;s army of adoring fans is more than happy to forgive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last year, <a href="/2020/05/adele-shares-stunning-weight-loss-photo-stirs-up-unexpected-cont/">Adele displayed her insane weight loss</a>, and many on social media lost their collective minds.</p>
<p>Some people had good takes. Others had bad takes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as far as Adele was concerned, the discussion was both &quot;brutal&quot; and deeply disappointing.</p>
<p>Gracing the cover of <em>British</em>&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>, Adele wishes that people could just be normal about her body.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In her first interview in half a decade, Adele admitted that her body transformation didn&#8217;t have an ideal reception.</p>
<p>As she told <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/adele-british-vogue-interview"><em>British Vogue</em></a>, she felt &quot;f&#8211;king disappointed&quot; to see who was having the most &quot;brutal conversations&quot; about her weight loss.</p>
<p>Why? Because most of the people discussing her body like the latest episode of prestige television were other women.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;My body&#8217;s been objectified my entire career,&quot; Adele pointed out as part of her cover story interview.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not just now,&quot; she acknowledged.</p>
<p>Still, the things being said and the people saying them left a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Obviously, many people praised Adele for her substantial weight loss.</p>
<p>She lost about 100 pounds in just two years. That is monumental.</p>
<p>But some of the praise was misplaced, which is where pushback entered the discourse.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Praising someone for getting the body that they want is generally a good thing.</p>
<p>But as some on social media pointed out, some of it was tone deaf or indirectly cruel.</p>
<p>Writing &quot;Adele is hot now&quot; both suggests that she wasn&#8217;t before and reminds many fat women that there are people who will only accept them if they follow suit.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That nuanced take was fine, but others were not.</p>
<p>Some tweeted that Adele&#8217;s weight loss was not praiseworthy under any context, which was &#8230; baffling.</p>
<p>Whether someone wants to gain weight, lose weight, keep the same weight, get a tattoo, remove a tattoo &#8212; <em>surely </em>we should cheer them on regardless.</p>

<p>As painful as it was to see people discuss whether her actual human body as if it were a new Senate bill, Adele understands.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand why it&#8217;s a shock,&quot; she acknowledged in her interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand why some women especially were hurt,&quot; Adele added.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Visually,&quot; Adele observed, &quot;I represented a lot of women.&quot;</p>
<p>She emphasized: &quot;But I&rsquo;m still the same person.&quot;</p>
<p>Adele, like almost everyone else, wants to be known for who she is and not for her flesh prison.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;And the worst part of the whole thing,&quot; Adele continued.</p>
<p>Then is when she noted &quot;that the most brutal conversations were being had by other women about my body.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very f&ndash;king disappointed with that,&quot; Adele noted. &quot;That hurt my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The people who felt personally betrayed by Adele changing her body&#8217;s shape are in many ways akin to those who felt betrayed by John Mulaney.</p>
<p>The comedian didn&#8217;t lose weight (he&#8217;d disappear), but he did <a href="/2021/09/john-mulaney-accused-of-cheating-on-ex-wife-impregnating-olivia/">impregnate Olivia Munn</a> and divorce his wife, Anna.</p>
<p>Many fans appreciated that his love for his wife and his disinterest in having kids, and were startled or even angered.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But with Adele and with John, we&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s real lives.</p>
<p>Relationships end, bodies change, and life takes a different path.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s on us as fans to not be so unhealthily fixated on an idea of a person that we see any change as a personal attack.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Adele did open up about how she lost about 100 pounds over &quot;a two-year period.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because of my anxiety,&quot; she explained. &quot;Working out, I would just feel better.&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of this followed her split from her ex, Simon Konecki.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;It was never about losing weight,&quot; Adele shared.</p>
<p>&quot;It was always about becoming strong,&quot; she explained, &quot;and giving myself as much time every day without my phone.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got quite addicted to it,&quot; Adele revealed. &quot;I work out two or three times a day.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-682x1024.jpg" alt="Adele Accepts a Grammy" class="wp-image-256050" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adele-accepts-a-grammy-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;People are shocked because I didn&rsquo;t share my &lsquo;journey,&#8217;&quot; Adele remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;They&rsquo;re used to people documenting everything on Instagram,&quot; she noted, &quot;and most people in my position would get a big deal with a diet brand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn&rsquo;t give a flying f&ndash;k,&quot; Adele quipped. &quot;I did it for myself and not anyone else. So why would I ever share it? &hellip; It&rsquo;s my body.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>There has been tremendous speculation about Adele&#8217;s love life, including <a href="/2020/10/chris-brown-and-adele-secretly-hooking-up/">alarming hookup rumors</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all of those questions are now being laid to rest &#8230; mostly.</p>
<p>Adele just went Instagram official with her previously rumored boyfriend.</p>
<p>Congratulations are in order!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Sunday, September 19, Adele &#8212; like so many other celebs &#8212; had some new photos to share.</p>
<p>She took to her Instagram to show off her look &#8230; but one of her pics featured a plus one.</p>
<p>Adele captioned the eye-catching image with a red heart emoji and no verbal commentary.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The man with her in the photo is Rich Paul.</p>
<p>He is a 39-year-old sports agent.</p>
<p>It has been rumored for some time that he and Adele are dating.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Given the emoji caption, the lack of alternative explanations, and the preexisting reports, this seems like confirmation.</p>
<p>Going &quot;Instagram official&quot; doesn&#8217;t always mean a big announcement or PDA.</p>
<p>It can, and often does, simply mean an affectionate couples photo to confirm what many already knew.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Adele looks gorgeous, either in color or in black and white.</p>
<p>But as eye-catching and appealing as her outfit and jewelry were, what really caught people&#8217;s eyes was her smile.</p>
<p>Maybe she was just doing an extra good job of posing for the camera, but perhaps it was her company that filled her with joy.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Paul is the founder of Klutch Sports.</p>
<p>He ranks number nine on Forbes&#8217; list of the world&#8217;s top 10 most powerful sports agents, a real list that exists.</p>
<p>For those of us to whom that list doesn&#8217;t mean much, here are some eye-opening details:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Paul is the agent for LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, and John Wall.</p>
<p>Even I recognize a couple of those names, which tells me how famous these athletes are.</p>
<p>Though wealth estimates can be iffy, Paul has an estimated net worth of $46 million.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Adele&#8217;s estimated net worth is several times that, give or take.</p>
<p>But many fans will find reassurance to know that she&#8217;s dating a successful and age-appropriate 8-digit millionaire.</p>
<p>Ever since her divorce, there were whispered fears among fans that she&#8217;d fall for some boy toy who wanted her money.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Adele didn&#8217;t actually finalize her divorce from Simon Konecki until March of this year.</p>
<p>The two share custody of Angelo, their eight-year-old son.</p>
<p>At the time that the divorce was finalized, Adele and her rich pal, Rich Paul, were not yet dating.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As recently as May, despite having been casually linked with Adele, Rich insistd that he was &quot;not dating.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that he was &quot;single&quot; at the time.</p>
<p>Two months later, in July, a very credible report from People said that Rich and Adele were casually dating.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="824" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-824x1024.jpg" alt="Adele Thanks Fans" class="wp-image-257993" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-241x300.jpg 241w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-768x954.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-1236x1536.jpg 1236w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-1648x2048.jpg 1648w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-735x913.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-270x335.jpg 270w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-279x347.jpg 279w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-419x520.jpg 419w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-515x640.jpg 515w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-618x768.jpg 618w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-773x960.jpg 773w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/adele-thanks-fans-869x1080.jpg 869w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Clearly, neither Adele nor Rich are prepared to share the details of their current relationship.</p>
<p>Obviously, things have progressed beyond the state of things in July.</p>
<p>For that matter, things are farther along than they were last week &#8212; since they&#8217;re now being open enough to share a photo.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In due time, we&#8217;re sure that Adele and Rich will open up more.</p>
<p>For now, they&#8217;re likely just enjoying each other&#8217;s company in some capacity.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re happy for them both and we wish them well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It sounds like the premise for an extremely dark romantic comedy.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s one of the most reviled public figures of his time, and she&#8217;s the second-most beloved singer of the 21st century (Beyonce still exists, after all) &#8212; but somehow they make it work!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, according to a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8829403/Chris-Brown-makes-cloak-dagger-late-night-visit-Adeles-west-London-home.html">new report </a>from the Daily Mail, Chris Brown paid a late-night, clandestine visit to Adele&#8217;s home in London over the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;It was all a bit cloak and dagger. He arrived in the middle of the night and didn&rsquo;t leave until around 2 am,&quot; says one insider.</p>
<p>&quot;He arrived in huge, blacked-out cars, with plenty of muscle surrounding him.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems Chris was in the UK to visit his son&nbsp;Aeko, whom he shares with ex Ammika Harris.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, Chris wore a mask while walking the streets of London, which is pretty amazing, when you think about it.</p>
<p>That means he spotted an opportunity to be an antagonistic douche, and he <em>didn&#8217;t</em> take it! Progress!</p>

<p>Anyway, no one knows what really went on with these two behind closed doors, but given that it&#8217;s 2020, we should probably assume the worst.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just gonna go ahead and brace ourselves for an engagement announcement and then be pleasantly surprised if it doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/04/adele-and-simon-konecki-its-over/">Adele finalized her divorce</a> from Simon Konecki last year, and there have been no reports of her getting involved with anyone new.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Breezy, unfortunately, has been on the prowl.</p>
<p>He<a href="/2020/01/chris-brown-threatens-to-date-newly-single-rihanna-again/"> threatened to date Rihanna</a> after she became single earlier this year.</p>
<p>And now, it seems he may have turned his attention toward Adele.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Optimists point out that Brown and Adele have been friends for several years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty bad on its own, but the upside is that Chris&#8217; visit might have been entirely platonic.</p>
<p>Sure, he slunk it late at night and left at 2 am, but if we were Chris Brown, we would travel under cover of darkness, too.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-681x1024.jpg" alt="Chris Brown in Yellow" class="wp-image-297384" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-768x1155.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-1021x1536.jpg 1021w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-1361x2048.jpg 1361w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-735x1106.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-425x640.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-510x768.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-638x960.jpg 638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-718x1080.jpg 718w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/chris-brown-in-yellow-scaled.jpg 1702w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to overstate how universally disliked this dude is.</p>
<p>We suppose it&#8217;s possible he likes himself, but even that seems doubtful.</p>
<p>We like to imagine he covers all the mirrors in his house to avoid looking himself in the eye.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Anyway, <a href="/2020/08/adele-flaunts-100-pound-weight-loss-in-new-pic-should-fans-be-co/">Adele lost a lot of weight</a> lately and we could see how she might be tempted to test out her new physique with a no-strings-attached shag.</p>
<p>Maybe she decided to do it with the worst person she knows to ensure that she wouldn&#8217;t wind up catching feelings.</p>
<p>Frankly, we&#8217;re just grasping at straws at this point because we can&#8217;t imagine living in a world where Adele would debase herself by dating Chris Brown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Just weeks after stunning the world with <a href="/2020/08/adele-flaunts-100-pound-weight-loss-in-new-pic-should-fans-be-co/">her 100 pound weight loss</a>, Adele has run into trouble.</p>
<p>Wearing her hair in bantu knots, she is accused of cultural appropriation.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Celebrities might not be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as much as the rest of us, but they&#8217;re still feeling the weirdness of 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;Happy what would be Notting Hill Carnival my beloved London,&quot; Adele captioned a new photo on Instagram.</p>
<p>Lamenting that the carnival was of course not happening as usual, she also shared this photo.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Now, Adele is seen here wearing a Jamaican flag bikini top.</p>
<p>She is also wearing bantu knots &#8212; a way of styling the natural hair of Black women.</p>
<p>While there is no question that she is making an effort to celebrate an occassion despite the pandemic &#8230; it&#8217;s not going over well.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Okay, so this photo was a tribute to the Notting Hill Carnival.</p>
<p>This is an event that celebrates Caribbean and Black culture in the UK.</p>
<p>The carnival event was celebrated virtually this year, for obvious COVID-19 reasons.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Okay, so first up, what are Bantu knots?</p>
<p>They are a traditional hairstyle for Black women, involving sectioning the hair with square or triangular parts.</p>
<p>The hair is then fastened into tight buns or knots on top of the head. These can be made from loose natural hair or from dreadlocks.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As you can imagine, Adele was quickly accused of cultural appropriation.</p>
<p>As a follower&#8217;s comment explains: &quot;Black women are discriminated against for wearing cultural hairstyles like bantu knots and locs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But white people are not,&quot; the comment continues, &quot;and that&#8217;s not fair and that&#8217;s why people are pissed off.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Dear white people,&quot; another commenter writes, &quot;please just be yourselves and stop it for good with cultural appropriation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adele,&quot; the comment reads, &quot;the bantu knots were unnecessary. The Jamaican flag bikini top was unnecessary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please just stop it,&quot; the commenter concludes.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Of course, others came to Adele&#8217;s defense, with one writing: &quot;WE LOVE SEEING OUR FLAG EVERYWHERE!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This made me smile,&quot; one wrote. &quot;It shows the impact my little island has on the whole world. How influential we truly are.&quot;</p>
<p>Another suggested: &quot;This is cultural appreciation, not appropriation.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a deeply complicated topic, and just because two Jamaicans might disagree does not mean that we, as white people, can simply pick the argument that we most support.</p>
<p>Often, there is a discrepency on these topics between people who live in their ancestral homelands and those who live in the US or UK.</p>
<p>Someone living in Jamaica would have less exposure to racist inequalities faced by a Jamaican living in the US or UK, and thus they might not see any harm.</p>

<p>As an earlier comment explained, white celebrities receive praise for appropriating hairstyles and aesthetics from women of color.</p>
<p>In turn, those women of color might be turned down for everyday jobs for wearing their hair in any of the hairstyles that naturally work for their hair.</p>
<p>The celebrities appropriating their styles didn&#8217;t create white supremacist beauty standards, but they do benefit &#8212; which is why marginalized communities would like for them to stop.</p>
