<p>Bob Dylan is one of the most important figures in all of rock music. And now, over 60 years into his career, he&#8217;s the subject of the new biopic <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>starring Timothée Chalamet. </p>



<p>Timothée&#8217;s performance is already getting buzz, and it seems likely that the movie will be a hit! The James Mangold-directed film is set in the first half of the 60s, chronicling Bob&#8217;s arrival in New York up until his 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance.</p>



<p>The movie is set to hit theaters on Christmas Day 2024, and critics are already starting to praise Timothée&#8217;s portrayal of Bob. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> for the film gave fans a sneak peak in October 2024.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Before going to see Timothée bring Bob&#8217;s early days to the big screen, there are lots of things to know about the <em>Blonde on Blonde </em>singer. Keep reading to learn more about Bob.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-real-name-isn-t-bob-dylan">His Real Name Isn&#8217;t Bob Dylan</h2>



<p>It may come as a surprise to some, but Bob Dylan&#8217;s real name is not &#8220;Bob Dylan.&#8221; Bob was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Minnesota in 1941. </p>



<p>As to why Bob chose &#8220;Dylan&#8221; for his surname, the most common legend refers to him borrowing it from the poet <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/dylan-thomas-patti-smith-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Thomas</a>, who was shouted out on Taylor Swift&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/the-tortured-poets-department-everything-we-know-about-taylor-swifts-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>.</a></p>

<p>Despite this being the most common claim, the man himself actually denied those rumors in a 1961 <em>New York Times</em> interview. &#8220;I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas,&#8221; he said, via <em><a href="https://wmgk.com/2018/05/24/bob-went-zimmerman-dylan/">WMGK</a></em>. &#8220;Dylan Thomas’ poetry is for people that aren’t really satisfied in their bed – for people who dig masculine romance.&#8221; </p>



<p>He did explain that he always intended on changing his name in his memoir <em>Chronicles: Volume 1</em>. He didn&#8217;t explain if there was a deeper meaning to choosing &#8220;Dylan&#8221; as his last name.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first time I was asked my name in the Twin Cities, I instinctively and automatically, without thinking, simply said: ‘Bob Dylan,'&#8221; he wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just called myself Robert Allen. As far as I was concerned, that was who I was – that’s what my parents named me. It sounded like the name of a Scottish king, and I liked it. There was little of my identity that wasn’t in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob has a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/10/bob-dylan-to-nobel-prize-committee-keep-your-sh-tty-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discography</a>. When you&#8217;ve been making music for over 60 years, you&#8217;ve had a lot of time to make some albums, and there&#8217;s plenty of Dylan material for new fans to dive into.</p>



<p>Bob&#8217;s first album was 1962&#8217;s self-titled record, and his most recent was 2023&#8217;s <em>Shadow Kingdom</em>. Over the past 60 years, Bob has released tons of classics like <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/11/bob-dylan-drops-like-a-rolling-stone-music-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highway 61 Revisited</a>, Blood on the Tracks, </em>and many more.</p>



<p>Many of Bob&#8217;s early hits weren&#8217;t for his own performances. Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221;, &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221;, and &#8220;Mr. Tambourine Man&#8221; were all <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/keith-urban-miley-cyrus-ashtray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered by other musicians</a>. Artists like Nina Simone, The Byrds, and Peter, Paul, and Mary recorded their own versions of Bob&#8217;s songs. </p>



<p>Aside from the studio albums, Bob has countless live records, bootlegs, compilations, and writing credits for other hits.</p>

<p>Bob was a major figure in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Many of his songs were considered protest anthems, and they spoke about the civil rights that people were fighting for. </p>



<p>Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221; and &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221; both expressed ideas about the civil rights movement and the fight against racism. Bob&#8217;s song &#8220;Only a Pawn in Their Game&#8221; is about the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers.</p>



<p>Perhaps most notably, Bob also performed at the 1963 March on Washington. He and fellow folk singer Joan Baez were both slated performers, per <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-dylan-only-a-pawn-in-their-game-1963-martin-luther-king-1011996/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a></em>. Bob&#8217;s four song set is not as well known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s famous &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech, which he delivered that day.</p>

<p>One of the most famous moments in Bob&#8217;s career, which is also featured in <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>was his 1965 performance at the Newport Folk Festival. </p>



<p>After making a name for himself as a folk musician (and acoustic performer), Bob shocked the crowd at the 1965 festival by performing with an electric guitar. He was met with outrage.</p>



<p>Bob only managed to play three songs, before he was booed off stage. Many folk fans felt that Bob was betraying his fanbase by performing with electric instruments. Some people had clearly thought he&#8217;d sold out.</p>



<p>Despite the controversy, many of the songs with electric instruments have since gone on to be classics. His first electric song &#8220;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#8221; is a beloved classic, and many of the tracks on <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> are regarded as classics, now.</p>

<p>Over the years, Bob has gotten to share the stage with tons of classic artists. Joan Baez was one of the biggest names that he performed with early in his career. Still, there are two bands that Bob is most often grouped with.</p>



<p>Most famously, Bob is associated with The Band. The classic rockers were already an established act, but Dylan recruited them to be his backing band beginning in 1966. Notably, Bob is the one who changed their name to The Band.</p>



<p>When The Band played their farewell concert <em>The Last Waltz </em>in 1976, Bob joined them for a few songs.</p>



<p>In the late 80s and early 90s, Bob was also a member of the Traveling Wilburys. The supergroup also included George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. They put out two albums together.</p>

<p>While plenty of artists slow down on the road as they get older, that&#8217;s not really the case for Bob. In June 1988, Bob set out on the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. Bob has been on the road consistently ever since. </p>



<p>He usually plays about 100 shows per year, and even though his 2021-2024 tour was dubbed the &#8220;Rough and Rowdy Ways&#8221; tour, many still consider it part of the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. </p>



<p>While many people will likely be interested in catching Bob after seeing <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, it is worth the warning that he does make significant changes to his songs live. Fans often complain about how difficult it can be to tell what songs he&#8217;s performing at recent concerts.</p>

<p>Yes, as you&#8217;ve probably heard from both your stoned baby boomer uncle who&#8217;s all jazzed about it, <em>and</em> your high school English teacher who randomly added you on Facebook and is<em> super</em>-pissed that Joyce Carol Oates got overlooked again, there&#8217;s a fair bit of controversy over the decision to honor Dylan with the literary world&#8217;s most coveted award.</p>
<p>Dylan is the first songwriter to win the award, and the committee heaped the highest praise upon his lyrics in their surprise announcement.</p>
<p>The decision has sparked a flurry of praise and a renewed interest in the literary merits of Dylan&#8217;s catalog, but the iconic rock star has yet to comment on any of it.</p>

<p>However, if you&#8217;re wondering how he feels about it, the answer, my friend, is blowin&#8217; in the wind:</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t give two sh-ts if you paid him.</p>
<p>“Right now we are doing nothing,&#8221; the committee&#8217;s permanent secretary, Sara Danius tells the <em>Guardian</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies. For now, that is certainly enough.”</p>
<p>She added:</p>
<p>“I am not at all worried. I think he will show up. If he doesn’t want to come, he won’t come. It will be a big party in any case and the honor belongs to him.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Clearly, Dylan isn&#8217;t content to simply take home the prize for literature.</p>
<p>He also wants the Nobel committee to invent a prize for ballsiness and award to the dude who&#8217;s being celebrated by the global academic community in Stockholm, but decides to stay home and clean his harmonica collection, because f&#8211;k all that noise.</p>
<p>The best part of all this is that Dylan isn&#8217;t some feeble recluse.</p>
<p>Far from it.</p>
<p>The man tours constantly, often tearing through multiple sets in a single night.</p>
<p>Our guess is that he&#8217;s had people falling over themselves to tell him what a genius he is since he was in his teens and, well &#8230; like everything else, even fawning praise can get old after a while.</p>
<p>Besides, <a href="/2011/12/keha-covers-bob-dylan-doesnt-suck/">Kesha covered Dylan</a> back in 2011, and obviously, that&#8217;s the highest honor any musician could ask for.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>No word on whether or not Dylan needs to attend the ceremony in order to receive the $900,000 check that comes with the award, but we&#8217;re sure that even if the<a href="/2014/11/bob-dylan-divorces-secret-wife-who-spent-all-of-his-money/"> rumors about his money problems</a> are true (they aren&#8217;t), he can&#8217;t be bothered to show up for a payday unless it involves the ghost of Woody Guthrie handing him a big cartoon burlap sack with a dollar sign painted on it.</p>
<p>Hopefully in lieu of an acceptance speech, Dylan will just shoot the committee a text like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think twice, it&#8217;s alright, bitches!&#8221;</p>

<p>The National Enquirer reports that the 73-year-old rock legend married secretly married Darlene Springs in 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tabloid claims Dylan is now in the process of divorcing Springs after finding out she began blowing his cash on everything from designer clothes to real estate just days after they made it official.</p>
<p>Guess we finally know what possessed Bob to make that Super Bowl commercial for Chrysler:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/bob-dylan-chrysler-commercial"></a></figure>
<p>&quot;When Bob found out how much she spent, he hit the roof,&quot; a source tells the Enquirer. &quot;He cut off communication with her. He wants a wife to be there for him &#8211; but Darlene was too busy shopping.&quot;</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>In addition to the Chrysler ad, his financial&nbsp;may help explain why <a href="/2011/12/keha-covers-bob-dylan-doesnt-suck/">Dylan&#8217;s allowed Kesha to cover his songs</a>, in addition to dozens of other unlikely artists. Apparently, he needs the cash!</p>
<p>Hopefully Bob&#8217;s moved on <a href="/2013/11/bob-dylan-drops-like-a-rolling-stone-music-video/">like a Rolling Stone</a>. We&#8217;re sure Darlene won&#8217;t <a href="/2012/02/miley-cyrus-performs-bob-dylan-cover-on-jimy-kimmel-live/">make him lonesome when she goes</a>. These song title jokes doing anything for ya?</p>

<p>On the same day that rapper released his <a href="/stars/kim-kardashian.html">Kim </a><a href="/stars/kim-kardashian.html">Kardashian</a>-filled video for &quot;<a href="/2013/11/kanye-west-bound-2-music-video-kim-kardashian-topless-on-a-motor/">Bound 2</a>,&quot; the iconic rocker came out with the official video for &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, nearly half a century after that track&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>The special video was designed by a company called Interlude and it allows the viewer to channel surf, as one is able to flip around and watch various individuals &#8211; including a few celebrities &#8211; lip-synching to the iconic tune he first released in 1965.</p>

But you wouldn&#8217;t know it if you followed this legend&#8217;s touring schedule.</p>
<p>The icon has played in Ho Chi Minh City and Australia, among other locales, over the past couple months. “I’m a firm believer in the longer you live, the better you get,” the rocker said. In 1968.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With timeless material such as &#8220;Blowin’ in the Wind,&#8221; &#8220;Like a Rolling Stone,&#8221; &#8220;Mr. Tambourine Man,&#8221; and &#8220;Mississippi,&#8221; who knows for how long Dylan will play and travel. We can&#8217;t see the Minnesota native slowing down any time soon, nor would we want him to.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p style="text-align: left;">So happy birthday, Bob Dylan! May your talent and energy never be a-changin.</p>

<p>Little did we know it was just a Bob Dylan cover sung by a no-talent hack.</p>
<p>The legendary singer of &quot;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind,&quot; &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#8217;&quot; and other American anthems has such an incredible resume, some of his works are lost in the shuffle, hidden gems waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Maybe now, &quot;Friday&quot; will be recognized among Dylan&#8217;s greatest hits:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/bob-dylan-friday-a-cover-of-rebecca-black"></a></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Follow the jump for Rebecca Black&#8217;s unbearable version &#8230;</p>

	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/rebecca-black-friday"></a></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>THG NOTE</strong>: Obviously this is not a real Bob Dylan song. It was recorded by some dude after Black&#8217;s nonsense came out. But the guy&#8217;s good, you gotta admit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tell us you don&#8217;t die laughing every time &quot;Bob&quot; sings the refrain, &quot;partyin&#8217; partyin&#8217; yeah.&quot; We&#8217;ve never appreciated the existence of weekends quite so much.</p>
