<p>Before Margaret connected with the <em>Strange Desire </em>singer, she had a string of relationships with other celebrities.</p>



<p>The actress&#8217;s first public romance was with fellow actor Nat Wolff. They first connected while filming <em>Palo Alto</em>, but they split up by August 2017, according to<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/margaret-qualleys-complete-dating-history-through-the-years-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Us Weekly</em>. </a></p>



<p>Margaret was tied to comedian Pete Davidson back in late 2019. The pair&#8217;s romance came after the funny man <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/pete-davidson-on-ariana-grande-she-dumped-me-because-mac-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke off his engagement</a> with Ariana Grande. He also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-and-kate-beckinsale-are-so-cute-toge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a brief fling</a> with Kate Beckinsale before linking up with Margaret.</p>



<p>It was reported that <em>The Leftovers </em>star and the <em>SNL </em>alum had been dating for a few months in August 2019, per <em><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29020403/pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-relationship-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a></em>. They were spotted together a few times that fall.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s mom actually spilled some details about their love. Andie MacDowell gushed about the young couple in a September 2019 interview with <em><a href="https://people.com/movies/andie-macdowell-margaret-qualley-pete-davidson-beautiful-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;She has a beautiful relationship with him but I don’t want to step on her relationship too much,&#8221; she told the outlet. Thanks, Mom! Unfortunately, a few weeks later, the pair called it quits.</p>



<p>In 2020, Margaret started dating Shia LeBeouf after appearing in her sister Rainey&#8217;s music video alongside him. In 2021, the pair split up after indie singer FKA Twigs filed a lawsuit for assault and sexual battery against Shia.</p>



<p>Shia has denied the allegations. The actress has shown support for FKA Twigs on social media and in interviews. &#8220;It was important to me for her to know that I believe her. It’s as simple as that,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%252Fculture%252Ffeatures%252Fa37628922%252Fmargaret-qualley-october-2021%252F%26sref%3D%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshia-labeouf-margaret-qualley-fka-twigs-abuse-b1928938.html&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshia-labeouf-margaret-qualley-fka-twigs-abuse-b1928938.html&amp;article_id=1928938&amp;author=Ellie+Harrison&amp;tag=Margaret+Qualley%2CShia+LaBeouf%2CFKA+Twigs%2Candie+macdowell§ion=TV+%26+Radio&amp;category=News&amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;updated_time=2021-09-29T06%3A41%3A49.000Z&amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;ref=www.independent.co.uk&amp;utm_source=independent&amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;gclid=N%2FA&amp;trx-iid=iid1740344487605fjf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper&#8217;s Bazaar </a></em>in 2021. </p>
