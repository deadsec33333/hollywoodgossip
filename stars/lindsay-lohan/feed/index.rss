										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Lindsay Lohan was recently a guest on Bravo&#8217;s <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>.</p>



<p>The actress reunited at one point with <em>Mean Girls</em> co-star Lacey Chabert and confirmed that she may one day star in an Ann-Margaret biopic.</p>



<p>The response to Lohan&#8217;s appearance, however, focused a lot less on what she said with her mouth &#8230; and a lot more with how she looked.</p>



<p>Especially when it came to her face.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="554" height="435" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/hq720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513689" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/hq720.jpg 554w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/hq720-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan appears here on Watch What Happens Live.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lohan has been largely out of the spotlight for a number of years.</p>



<p>She has appeared in the occasional music video or narrated the occasional television series over the past few years, but it&#8217;s easy to forget at this point that Lohan was a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/">celebrity gossip</a> mainstay for years back in the early and mid-2000s.</p>



<p>Not always for the most positive of reasons, either.</p>



<p>Now, however, Lohan has a new Netflix movie coming out &#8212; which is why she appeared on <em>Watch What Happens Live</em> and why many people are seeing her for the first time in ages.</p>



<p>And which may explain their confusion over just what&#8217;s in front of them.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-682x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513692" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan attends the screening of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Our Little Secret&#8221; at The Paris Theatre on November 18, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The natural redhead has been known for her freckled complexion, but take a look at the very first photo within this article.</p>



<p>Take a close look.</p>



<p>Do you see any freckles there, while Lohan sat across from Andy Cohen?</p>



<p>Nope. Neither do we. And we&#8217;re not alone.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="700" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-1024x700.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513693" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-768x525.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-2048x1401.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-960x657.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-1080x739.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2171065275-1200x821.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan attends the 2024 Kering for Women dinner at The Pool on September 9, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Wait doesn&#8217;t she have freckles??&#8221; one social media user asked after seeing Lohan on Bravo.</p>



<p>Another said Lohan looks &#8220;great,&#8221; but also noted that she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;look like Lindsay Lohan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Could Lindsay just have been covering up her freckles with some makeup? That&#8217;s what some folks are theorizing.</p>



<p>Either way, though, the consensus out there appears to be that Lohan has come a long way since her more troubled days.</p>



<p>Last year, in an Instagram video that went viral, the actress revealed that she overcame childhood insecurities, including her dislike of her famous freckles.</p>



<p>&#8220;They used to make me uncomfortable as a kid, but now I realize how beautiful they are,&#8221; Lohan said at the time.</p>

<p>In honor of <a href="/2016/10/mean-girls-day-an-appreciation/"><em>Mean Girls</em> Day</a>, we thought there was no better time to check in on the possibility of a Mean Girls sequel.</p>



<p>In short, anyone who is anyone who was involved with the first movie wants to see a sequel happen. This includes Lindsay Lohan! </p>



<p>For the better part of the last decade or so, Lindsay has been hinting that the gang should get back together. </p>



<p>Now, with her brand being reboots and nostalgia and a few reunions already under her belt, it might just be time for a Mean Girls sequel to to finally be a thing. </p>



<p>So fetch, right? Let&#8217;s fill you in on what we know. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-lohan-s-wanted-a-mean-girls-sequel-for-years">Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s Wanted A Mean Girls Sequel For YEARS! </h2>





<p>Travel back with us, if you will, to 2016. </p>



<p>As Lindsay Lohan lives on Lindsay Lohan time, she was spotted celebrating <em>Mean Girls </em>Day a week and a half late that October with a throwback that brings to mind that girl in your Facebook feed who peaked in high school.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s back-in-the-day Lindsay along with Gretchen Wieners and Regina George.</p>



<p>Okay, considering the film came out 20 years ago, and they&#8217;re both grown-ass women in their thirties, Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert would probably prefer to be referred to by their proper names, but we just have a hard  time letting go of Tina Fey&#8217;s cult classic.</p>



<p>And it seems we&#8217;re not the only ones&#8230;</p>



<p>Lindsay posted a pic on October 13th of the Mean Girl girlies, along with a caption reading: &#8220;#tbt &#8230; miss you all&#8230; sequel?&#8221;</p>



<p>Now,  of course we know that a Insta post doesn&#8217;t mean much. Except that floated the idea out there &#8230; and some interesting things happened after that. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="751" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761-1024x751.jpg" alt=" Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried 2005 MTV Movie Awards" class="wp-image-510574" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761-300x220.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761-768x563.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761-960x704.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761-1080x792.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/GettyImages-53021761.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried pose in the audience during the 2005 MTV Movie Awards at the Shrine Auditorium June 4, 2005 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mean-girls-reunion-everyone-wanted-and-now-wants-more-of">The Mean Girls Reunion Everyone Wanted &#8211; And Now Wants More Of!</h2>



<p>In 2020, Lindsay, along with creator Tina Fey, and most of the original cast, reunited on October 3 for a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU17wW4MYSU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted by Katie Couric</a> to encourage people to vote in the election. </p>



<p>A few days later, Lindsay delighted fans again as she Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried re-created their famous four-way phone call from the 2004 comedy.</p>



<p>And THEN, Lindsay returned to North Shore High along with Lacy and Amanda to reprise their characters as adults in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TUe3XWz1d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart&#8217;s Black Friday commercial</a> in 2023. </p>



<p>So you see, these ladies just can&#8217;t keep away from each other. And frankly, no one wants them to! But what about an actual MOVIE? Well, there is good news on that front. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-lohan-amp-rachel-mcadams-interested-in-making-mean-girls-sequel">Lindsay Lohan &amp; Rachel McAdams &#8216;Interested&#8217; in Making <em>Mean Girls</em> Sequel </h2>



<p>Now, glaringly absent from the Walmart ad was Rachel, who played everyone&#8217;s favorite baddie, Regina Geroge.</p>



<p>The rumor was she didn&#8217;t participate due to her schedule, but it opened up the conversation about a sequel down the line. And according to sources, it sounds like everyone&#8217;s in! </p>



<p>“She has no regrets about not doing a Walmart commercial, which is a different thing,&#8221; a source shared with <em>People Magazine</em> about Rachel. </p>



<p>&#8220;She is super busy, but likes her former cast members and would be interested in <a href="https://people.com/lindsay-lohan-rachel-mcadams-interested-in-mean-girls-sequel-20-years-later-exclusive-8641140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking about a sequel </a>if it becomes a reality.”</p>



<p>The same goes for Lindsay, who the same source said “wants to do another [<em>Mean Girls</em>] and has a good relationship with her former cast members.”  </p>



<p>“They are her friends and have been. Another film would be great for her and for audiences who loved the original.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-has-the-story-all-planned-out">Lindsay Has The Story All Planned Out! </h2>



<p>Yes, if you frequently read Lindsay&#8217;s interviews, and your family hasn&#8217;t yet intervened with a Kindle and a library card, then you know the actress is still hyped on the idea of a <em>Mean Girls</em> sequel.</p>



<p>Back in 2014, Linds revealed that MG2 was part of her &#8220;<a href="/2014/09/lindsay-lohan-reveals-hilarious-five-year-plan-mean-girls-2-an-o/">five year plan</a>.&#8221; (which also included an Oscar, but never mind that)</p>



<p>She even revealed she has an (extremely rough) plot outline:</p>



<p>&#8220;Like an older version where they&#8217;re all housewives and they&#8217;re all cheating,&#8221; she once told an interviewer.</p>



<p>A year later, she posted a photo from the set of the original film with a caption reading:</p>



<p>&#8220;Next step: #MEANMOMS (I&#8217;m trying to make it happen!)&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, LiLo&nbsp;is basically Gretchen Wieners when it comes to making this happen.</p>



<p>But unlike &#8220;fetch,&#8221; the idea of <em>Mean Girls 2</em> has a chance of catching on.</p>



<p>Nostalgia is all the rage these days, and Lindsay is already riding the wave with the sequel to Freaky Friday. </p>



<p>Honestly, it just makes sense to get Mean Girls 2 going next!</p>



<p>And yes, we are aware there is technically a Mean Girls 2 out there, but just like the limit, to us, it does not exist. </p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s all true!</p>



<p>Not only that, Lindsay has two other siblings, both of whom have also appeared in her movies!</p>





<p>Lindsay is the eldest, and of all her younger sibs, it seems that Dakota &#8212; her co-star in Irish Wish &#8212; is the most serious about acting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-lohan-s-siblings-what-are-their-careers">Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s Siblings: What Are Their Careers?</h2>



<p>Aliana and Michael Lohan Jr. both made uncredited cameos in a few of Lindsay&#8217;s early films, but they&#8217;ve since changed directions in their respective careers.</p>



<p>Michael went to business school and is currently living the civilian life away from the spotlight.</p>



<p>Ali, meanwhile, has launched a career as a Christian pop singer.</p>

<p>Dakota, however, has decided to follow in Lindsay&#8217;s footsteps.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s appeared in a handful of film and television projects thus far &#8212; he also works as a model &#8212; but <em>Irish Wish</em> is likely his most high-profile work to date.</p>



<p>And Netflix is leaning into the heartwarming &#8220;siblings on set&#8221; angle in their promotion of the movie.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the streaming giant posted the above video in which Lindsay and Dakota set the record straight on some common misconceptions about their family.</p>



<p>&#8220;Siblings fact check? i’m so here for this. IRISH WISH premieres on Friday,&#8221; the company captioned the post.</p>



<p>We learned quite a bit from that short clip! Their name is pronounced &#8220;low-in&#8221; and not &#8220;lo-han&#8221;? Who knew?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-irish-wish-what-is-it-about">&#8216;Irish Wish&#8217;: What Is It About?</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t have any details about Dakota&#8217;s role in the film, but we do have the following synopsis from the  movie&#8217;s official logline:</p>



<p>&#8220;When the love of her life gets engaged to her best friend, Maddie puts her feelings aside to be a bridesmaid at their wedding in Ireland. </p>



<p>&#8220;Days before the pair are set to marry, Maddie makes a spontaneous wish for true love, only to wake up as the bride-to-be. </p>

<p>&#8220;With her dream seeming to come true, Maddie soon realizes that her real soulmate is someone else entirely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s the perfect film for a pair of ginger siblings to star in just before St. Patrick&#8217;s Day!</p>

<p>She once starred in Parent Trap.</p>



<p>Now now?</p>



<p>Lindsay Lohan is herself a parent!</p>



<p>Amazing how time flies and things change, isn&#8217;t it?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hooray for Lindsay Lohan and Bader Shammas! The couple welcomed a child in July 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 36-year old actress and her husband, Bader Shammas, have welcomed a son into the world… according to a rep for Lohan.</p>



<p>We cannot confirm the child&#8217;s exact date of birth.</p>



<p>We cannot report on his measurements at this time, either. As for his name, however?</p>



<p>&#8220;Lindsay Lohan and her Financier husband, Bader Shammas, welcomed a beautiful, healthy son named Luai. The family is over the moon in love,&#8221; the aforementioned rep said in a statement on Monday.</p>



<p>(For the record, Luai is an Arabic name that means “shield” or “protector.”)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It&#8217;s time to imagine Lindsay Lohan as a mother.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lohan and Shammes got married in 2002 and announced in March that the former was expecting her first child, posting a photo of a baby onesie and writing at the time and writing: </p>



<p>&#8220;We are blessed and excited!&#8221;  </p>



<p>The veteran, and previously-troubled star, added in a statement to TMZ:</p>



<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to this next chapter of our lives!&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lohan, for those unaware, had a successful movie career in Hollywood in the early 2000s due to such hits as Freaky Friday, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Just My Luck&#8230; before she quietly relocated to Dubai.</p>



<p>“It just really happened, how I moved to Dubai. I got there, and I felt a certain sense of calm,” Lohan told Vogue in April 2022 of her decision to leave Los Angeles. </p>



<p>“I think it’s because paparazzi is illegal [in Dubai]. I really found that I had a private life, and I could just take time for myself. </p>



<p>&#8220;I decided to stay there because I really learned to appreciate what it is to go, do my work, and then leave and live a normal life.”</p>

<p>In a June interview with Allure, meanwhile, the actress opened up about her new chapter ahead, where she&#8217;ll balance her career and being a mom.</p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t wait to see what the feeling is and what it&#8217;s like to just be a mom,&#8221; she told the outlet. </p>



<p>&#8220;Happy tears. That&#8217;s just who I am. Though now, it’s probably baby emotion. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s overwhelming in a good way.”</p>

<p>Lohan and Shammas have mostly remained out of the spotlight since getting hitched.</p>



<p>However, the star gushed over her spouse in a July 2022 Instagram post.</p>



<p>&#8220;You found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time,&#8221; Lohan wrote back then, sending the message as she was preparing for her Hollywood return in the Netflix movie Falling for Christmas. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am stunned that you are my husband. My life and my everything, every woman should feel like this everyday.&#8221;</p>



<p>Congratulations to the brand new parents1</p>

<p>The announcement of a planned pregnancy is almost always a joyous occasion.</p>



<p>But news of the latest celebrity mom-to-be is sure to receive a very mixed reaction on social media!</p>



<p>Yes, Lindsay Lohan is pregnant with her first child, and while most commenters have offered their congratulations, some folks have been quick to express concern.</p>



<p>We guess that makes sense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan is pregnant with her first child! The actress made the announcement on Instagram Tuesday morning! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>After all, it wasn&#8217;t all that long ago that the mention of Lindsay becoming a mom would have prompted millions of concerned fans to place simultaneous, pre-emptive calls to CPS, warning them of what&#8217;s about to go down.</p>



<p>But that was then, and this is now.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/lindsay-lohan-married-to-some-guy-named-bader-shammas/">Lindsay is married to Bader Shammas</a>, and insiders say the couple enjoys a quiet, content life in Dubai where they make lots of healthy decisions and do little to no partying.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan just announced that she&#8217;s pregnant! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Lohan shared her joyous news with the world by posting the photo above on Instagram.</p>



<p>“We are blessed and excited!” the 36-year-old wrote in her caption.</p>



<p>Perhaps a more &#8220;basic&#8221; announcement than one might expect from a woman who&#8217;s spent her life in the spotlight, but it could be indicative, of the more quiet, humble life that LiLo is said to be living these days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan is expecting her first child! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“She is feeling great and she is thrilled,”<a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/03/14/lindsay-lohan-pregnant-expecting-first-baby-with-bader-shammas/"> a rep for Lindsay</a> tells Page Six.</p>



<p>Lindsay keeps a pretty low profile these days, but she&#8217;s been surprisingly candid about some developments in her life in recent months.</p>



<p>Lohan and Shammas tied the knot in July of 2022, and while the wedding took place in secret, the couple confirmed the news of their nuptials shortly thereafter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan and Bader Shammas will soon be parents! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In November, Lindsay and Bader made their red carpet debut while promoting her comeback film, a Netflix holiday romcom titled <em>Falling For Christmas</em>.</p>



<p>The movie turned out to be a kitchsy favorite with audiences, and just like that, Lindsay pulled off one of the most unexpected comebacks in Hollywood history.</p>



<p>Thus far, she hasn&#8217;t said much about her pregnancy, but she&#8217;s been very vocal about her love for Bader.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan and Bader Shammas are happily married. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I am the luckiest woman in the world. He found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time,” Lohan recently wrote on Instagram.</p>



<p>“I am stunned that this is my husband. My life and my everything. Every woman should feel like this everyday.”</p>



<p>Clearly, Lindsay is on top of the world these days.</p>

<p>Surely, some folks will cast doubt on her parenting capabilities.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;d like to add our voice to the chorus of millions offering their sincere congratulations to Lindsay and Bader!</p>

<p>Like so many others in Hollywood, Lindsay Lohan is in mourning over the death of Aaron Carter.</p>



<p>Unlike many others in Hollywood, however, Lindsay Lohan had a very close personal connection to the artist, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">was found dead this past Saturday</a>&#8216; inside his home in California:</p>



<p>Lohan and Carter dated when they were young teenagers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>In a pair of interviews Monday about her upcoming Netflix movie, Falling for Christmas, Lohan reflected on her time with the former child pop star.</p>



<p>&#8220;My heart goes out to his family and may he rest in peace,&#8221; she told Entertainment Tonight, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;My heart goes out to his family and may he rest in peace. And God bless him… and yeah, just [a] lot of love there.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a separate interview with Access Hollywood, Lohan said she shared so many memories with Carter when she was &#8220;so young,&#8221; but clarified that it had been &#8220;long time&#8221; since the two had spoken to each other.</p>

<p>Lohan and Carter reportedly dated from January 2002 to April 2003.</p>



<p>Around this same time, Carter, Lohan and Hilary Duff made headlines for being in an apparent love triangle, considering Aaron started dating Lohan shortly after splitting from Duff. </p>



<p>Duff also posted a tribute to her late ex over the weekend.</p>



<p>&#8220;For Aaron &#8212; I&#8217;m deeply sorry that life so hard for you and that you had to struggle in-front of the whole world,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram.</p>



<p>&#8220;You had a charm that absolutely effervescent… boy did my teenage self love you deeply. Sending love to your family at this time. Rest easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger brother of Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter, Aaron was found dead at his house in Lancaster, California on Saturday morning by his housekeeper.</p>



<p>No official cause of death has been released, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">there are theories out there</a>.</p>



<p>During their concert in London Sunday night, the Backstreet Boys honored Carter. </p>



<p>&#8220;We just wanted to find a moment in our show to recognize that Nick&#8217;s little brother, Aaron Carter, passed away yesterday at 34 years old,&#8221; Kevin Richardson told the crowd. </p>



<p>&#8220;He was a part of our family and we thank you guys for all the love and all the well wishes and all the support.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter had recently welcomed his first child, 11-month-old son Prince, with his on-and-off fiancée Melanie Martin, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carters-fiancee-breaks-silence-on-tragic-death-of-young-singer/">openly mourned Aaron a couple days ago</a>.</p>



<p>So did Nick and Aaron&#8217;s twin sister, Angel.</p>



<p>Uploading a number of photos of the brothers growing up together, Nick shared that he &#8220;always held onto the hope, that he would somehow, someday want to walk a healthy path and eventually find the help that he so desperately needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, Aaron was in and out of rehab for a number of years prior to his death.</p>



<p>&#8220;The truth is that addiction and mental illness is the real villain here,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/nick-carter-mourns-death-of-younger-brother-my-heart-has-been-broken/">Nick Carter added</a>. </p>

<p>Following a few difficult years in which some fans worried about her health and others treated her like a punchline, Lindsay Lohan appears to have landed back on her feet.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/lindsay-lohan-married-to-some-guy-named-bader-shammas/">Lohan got married to Bader Shammas</a> earlier this year, and she seems to be enjoying a life of quiet domesticity in her new home in the United Arab Emirates.</p>



<p>But it stands to reason that from time to time, Lindsay wonders what might have been.</p>



<p>After all, it wasn&#8217;t all that long ago that she was one of the most famous entertainers on the planet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="740" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-740x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461734" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-740x1024.jpg 740w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-217x300.jpg 217w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-768x1062.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-1111x1536.jpg 1111w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-735x1017.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-242x335.jpg 242w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-251x347.jpg 251w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-376x520.jpg 376w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-463x640.jpg 463w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-555x768.jpg 555w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-694x960.jpg 694w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332-781x1080.jpg 781w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1185598332.jpg 1446w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Lindsay Lohan is back in the spotlight. And she&#8217;s offering some new insights into what became of her career. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Lindsay hasn&#8217;t appeared in a film since 2019, but that will soon change, thanks to her role in the upcoming Netflix release <em>Falling For Christmas</em>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a step in the right direction, but playing an amnesia victim in a straight-to-streaming holiday romcom probably isn&#8217;t what Lindsay imagined for herself at this point in her career.</p>



<p>The wild success of her <em>Mean Girls</em> co-stars (Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams, and Lizzie Kaplan have all gone on to bigger and better things) likely underscores Lohan&#8217;s sense of disappointment.</p>



<p></p>

(Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<p>Well, the usual narrative is that Lindsay partied too much and burned a lot of bridges, and she eventually turned into a risk that no studio was willing to take.</p>



<p>But in a <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a41646042/lindsay-lohan-return-to-acting/">new interview</a> with <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, Lindsay claims that she was merely a victim of bad timing.</p>



<p>The actress says that there&#8217;s &#8220;too much&#8221; social media nowadays, but she argues that tools like Instagram and Twitter would have enabled her to exert control over her public image, instead of allowing the tabloid media to shape the way she&#8217;s perceived.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="834" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-1024x834.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461736" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-1024x834.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-300x244.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-768x625.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-1536x1251.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-2048x1668.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-735x599.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-335x273.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-347x283.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-520x424.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-640x521.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-960x782.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1079255810-1080x880.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Lindsay Lohan has some theories about why she&#8217;s not as famous as she used to be.

<p></p>



<p>“When I first started out in the business, none of us had a say in how to control our own narrative. There were paparazzi pictures, and then people ran with it,” Lindsay told the mag.</p>



<p>“So I think it’s really good that in this day and age, people can say who they are and who they want to be,&#8221; Lohan continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I admire and appreciate that. I’m a little jealous because I didn’t have that.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="869" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-869x1024.png" alt="Lindsay in Greece" class="wp-image-315623" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-869x1024.png 869w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-255x300.png 255w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-768x905.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-735x866.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-284x335.png 284w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-294x347.png 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-441x520.png 441w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-543x640.png 543w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-652x768.png 652w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece-815x960.png 815w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/lindsay-in-greece.png 914w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Lindsay Lohan briefly lived in Greece. She also briefly starred in a reality show about her life there. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>We <em>think</em> we understand what Lindsay is saying here.</p>



<p>Social media can, after all, offer an opportunity to explain one&#8217;s self or to offer insight into unusual choices or behaviors.</p>



<p>But it also offers new and exciting ways to mess up.</p>



<p><em>Maybe</em>, a young, frequently intoxicated Lindsay would have used Instagram to offer insight into actions and behaviors that were misrepresented by the media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Lindsay Lohan hanging out in her current home city of Dubai. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>But it&#8217;s just as likely that she would have used that additional exposure to torpedo her own career even faster.</p>



<p>LiLo went on to reveal that she finds the current social media climate more than a little confusing.</p>



<p>“You have to take everything people say with a grain of salt and just be you. And slow down, because everyone’s so quick right now,” she said. </p>



<p>“People just don’t stop. You’ve got to chill,&#8221; Lindsay continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Lindsay Lohan stands around here and snaps a selfie. She placed this image on her Instagram account. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I think it moves really fast, and I just try to keep up as best I can. And I check everything before I post it. I’ll send it to people — because you have to,”</p>



<p>Sounds like Lindsay is being much more careful about her public image these days.</p>



<p>And we wish her all the luck in the world as she attempts to rebuild her career.</p>

<p>Sorry, fellas:</p>



<p>But Lindsay Lohan is officially off the market.</p>



<p>In celebration of her 36th birthday on Saturday, the veteran actress and long-time troublemaker surprised Instagram followers when she penned a tribute to boyfriend Bader Shammas.</p>



<p>And announced in the process that he&#8217;s now her <strong><em>husband</em></strong>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I am the luckiest woman in the world,&#8221; wrote Lohan to open her tribute, continuing as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;You found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am stunned that you are my husband. My life and my everything. every woman should feel like this everyday.&#8221;</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t provide any details regarding the proposal or the wedding, but a rep for Lohan has confirmed that she and Bader Shammas are, indeed, wife and husband.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We learned in November 2021 that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/lindsay-lohan-engaged-to-bader-shammas/">Shammas and Lohan were engaged</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;My love. My life. My family. My future,&#8221; Lohan captioned a set of photos of herself and Shammas at the time.</p>



<p>A source subsequently told Us Weekly that the couple was not in a &#8220;rush&#8221; to exchange vows.</p>



<p>In February, Lohan shared an update on her nuptials when Extra host Rachel Lindsay asked her what sort of bride she thought she would be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more low-key. Even on my birthday I want to make sure everyone else is good and then I can be okay. So I&#8217;ll be more like that,&#8221; Lohan told Lindsay a few months ago in response.</p>



<p>Focusing on the same romantic topic, Lohan continued:</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking at destinations.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already started talking to a friend of mine about the dress. But I want to do things right and I want to pace everything. </p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s an exciting time. I&#8217;m very girly, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Bader is a businessman and the son of a Lebanese mom and Kuwaiti dad. He resides in Dubai, which is where Lohan has lived for the past few years.</p>



<p>The assistant vice president at Credit Suisse, he attended the University of South Florida&#8230; where he studied mechanical engineering &#8212; and was later a finance student at the University of Tampa.</p>



<p>Neither he nor his famous now-wife have talked much in public about their romance, but Lohan&#8217;s unstable mother, Dina, told Us Weekly in April 2020 that Bader is &#8220;wonderful.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>In June, Lohan did gush over her partner on his birthday, writing on Instagram last month:</p>



<p>&#8220;My love! You&#8217;re not only a great man, an incredible person, you&#8217;re my best friend. Thank you for you loving me back babe! </p>



<p>&#8220;I Love You So much! Happy Birthday.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Lohan, meanwhile, relocated to Dubai in 2014, which is where she met Shammas for the first time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt so relieved when I moved everything over from London to Dubai and I saw everything in place,” the polarizing star told W magazine in a February 2018 interview. “</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s a cleansing of your head, which is what I needed, and it took me a while to do it&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I would love to own a place in New York, and that’s something I will look into in the future, but right now I’m okay with where I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>First, <a href="/2021/11/britney-spears-reacts-to-end-of-conservatorship-best-day-ever/">Britney Spears&#8217; conservatorship came to an end</a> after years of legal wrangling.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, <a href="/2021/11/carter-reum-marries-paris-hilton-but-will-it-last/">Paris Hilton got married</a>.</p>
<p>And to close out the comeback year, last week brought news that <a href="/2021/11/lindsay-lohan-engaged-to-bader-shammas/">Lindsay Lohan is engaged</a> to Dubai banker Bader Shammas.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a big few week for the ladies who were recently dubbed the Holy Trinity of the 2000s.</p>
<p>On her latest episode of her podcast, Paris addressed that reverential nickname, as well as the 15-year anniversary of one of the most famous photos of her career.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re over 30, you&#8217;ve seen (and possibly obsessed over it):</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Paris, Britney, and Lindsay are in a chauffeured car, surrounded by paparazzi during a night of club-hopping.</p>
<p>They look like they&#8217;re having the time of their lives, but they also like as though they just <em>ran</em> for their lives, perhaps having been pursued through the parking lot by paps and autograph hounds.</p>
<p>But according to Paris, it wasn&#8217;t just the fans and the press that she and Britney were running from.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I also just saw that Lindsay got engaged,&quot; the 40-year-old newlywed said on the latest episode of her popular pod.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;And I know that we&#8217;ve had our differences in the past, but I just wanted to say congratulations to her and that I am genuinely very happy for her.&quot;</p>
<p>What are those differences, you might be wondering?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Well, it seems that the years-long Paris-Lindsay feud was at least partially a result of that famous photo.</p>
<p>Asked about during a 2017 interview, Hilton made it sound as though she and Spears were the A-listers, and Lohan was just the lame tagalong who wouldn&#8217;t take the hint to get lost.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just Brit and I out, and then [Lindsay] just, like, chased us to the car and got in. She wasn&#8217;t invited,&quot; Paris recalled.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She wasn&#8217;t on the list.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, Paris went full Regina George on the one and only Cady Heron. Not very fetch!</p>
<p>In 2019, Hilton doubled-down on her anti-LiLo sentiments during an appearance on Bravo&#8217;s<em> Watch What Happens Live</em>.</p>

<p>When host Andy Cohen asked Paris to describe Lindsay in three words, the famed celebutante replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond, lame, and embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty serious shade, and unless Lindsay offended Paris in some way that isn&#8217;t clear, it was totally uncalled for.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>And we can&#8217;t help but wonder if Paris was putting words in Britney&#8217;s mouth by making it sound like the two of them were looking down their noses at Lindsay that fateful night.</p>
<p>After all, Spears and Lohan were the <em>entertainers</em> who worked their way up from obscurity.</p>
<p>Hilton was the oddball who was <em>born</em> rich and famous!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But hey, the important thing is that the mature and newly-married Paris sees no reason to continue her one-sided war against Lindsay.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been 15 years since this #iconic photo was snapped, and we were dubbed the #HolyTrinity of the 2000&rsquo;s,&quot; Hilton wrote on Instagram today along with some clips from the podcast episode.</p>
<p>&quot;So much has happened since that night.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>From there, Paris congratulated the rest of her party posse on their recent successes:</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen years later, and so much has happened in the past two weeks,&quot; Paris pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;I got married. Britney got her freedom back and engaged. Lindsay just got engaged,&quot; she went on.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="796" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-796x1024.jpg" alt="Carter Reum, Wife" class="wp-image-12654" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-796x1024.jpg 796w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-233x300.jpg 233w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-768x988.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-1194x1536.jpg 1194w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-1592x2048.jpg 1592w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-735x945.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-260x335.jpg 260w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-270x347.jpg 270w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-404x520.jpg 404w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-498x640.jpg 498w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-597x768.jpg 597w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-746x960.jpg 746w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-840x1080.jpg 840w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/11/carter-reum-wife-scaled.jpg 1990w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I love seeing how different our lives are now, and how much we&#8217;ve grown up.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, a lot has changed for the three mega-stars who were the envy of club-hoppers everywhere back in 2006.</p>
<p>And we hope that Paris and Lindsay will soon take the next step in the lifelong maturation process by officially burying the hatchet!</p>
