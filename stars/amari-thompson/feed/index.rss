<p>Kim Kardashian tackled a very sensitive subject with her family.</p>



<p>On <em>The Kardashians</em>, Khloe threw a birthday bash for Tristan&#8217;s brother, Amari.</p>



<p>While Khloe seeks to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hide her children from reality</a> in some ways, she and Kim both agree that they want their kids to know Amari &#8212; and others who are not like him.</p>



<p>In a delicate parenting moment, Kim did ask her kids if she felt &#8220;a little bit scared&#8221; attending her cousins&#8217; 18-year-old uncle&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-khloe-kardashian-threw-a-birthday-party-for-amari-thompson">Khloe Kardashian threw a birthday party for Amari Thompson</h2>



<p>During the most recent episode of <em>The Kardashians</em> on Hulu, the titular Kardashians celebrated a birthday.</p>



<p>Despite some <em>birthday discourse</em> earlier this season, Khloe threw the party. It was not for one of her famous sisters.</p>



<p>Instead, the birthday party was for Tristan Thompson&#8217;s brother. Amari, who has Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/khloe-kardashian-reveals-sons-face-everyone-meet-tatum-hes-so-cute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come up before on the show</a>.</p>

<p>On the Thursday, April 3 episode, Khloe commented about how small children do not always know how to react to someone with disabilities.</p>



<p>“My kids are much more exposed to Amari than some of the other kids,&#8221; the mother of two acknowledged. &#8220;So True is more concerned than frightened of Amari.&#8221;</p>



<p>Khloe very accurately added: “But I do think it is important for our kids &#8212; and everyone’s kids &#8212; to be exposed to all different types of people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-where-kim-kardashian-weighed-in">This is where Kim Kardashian weighed in</h2>



<p>Kim Kardashian, whose children are a little older, chimed in: “I love our kids growing up around him and helping him.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued, noting: “They have lots of questions and at times they might not be the most comfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim emphasized: &#8220;But I think it is so important that they play with him and they really get to know him.”</p>

<p>Later, Kim directly asked 6-year-old daughter Chicago if she and her friends felt &#8220;a little bit scared.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then stressed: “But it is OK if you are.”</p>



<p>Most 6-year-olds do not attend 18th birthday parties for people to whom they are related. However, the party went on without any apparent incident &#8212; until Amari&#8217;s brief seizure. </p>



<p>Kris Jenner seemed the most distressed by that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-lgs-like">What is LGS like?</h2>



<p>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare but severe epilepsy disorder that manifests during childhood. While about 95% of those with LGS survive into adulthood, the condition has numerous associations &#8212; including cognitive impairment, brain malformations, and even tumors.</p>



<p>Many with LGS suffer seizures almost daily. This is part of Amari&#8217;s life. </p>



<p>Tristan Thompson stepped up to care for his brother after his mother, Andrea, passed away in January 2023. </p>
