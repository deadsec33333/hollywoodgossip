<p>Jasmine Pineda is pregnant, and it isn&#8217;t her <em>90 Day Fiance</em> husband Gino Palazzolo&#8217;s.</p>



<p>For months, fans have wondered <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/gino-and-jasmine-divorce-90-day-fiance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why Gino and Jasmine split</a>. They never seemed like a perfect or healthy couple, of course. Fans just wondered which of many factors finally broke them up.</p>



<p>This season of <em>90 Day: The Last Resort</em> has aimed to answer that.</p>



<p>Now, Jasmine is announcing her pregnancy and showing off her baby bump. And the timing is tied to a key detail on <em>The Last Resort</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-90-day-fiance-star-jasmine-pineda-is-pregnant">&#8217;90 Day Fiance&#8217; star Jasmine Pineda is pregnant!</h2>



<p>At least it isn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/90-day-fiance-gino-jasmine-fight-knife-dane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dane&#8217;s</a>. But it isn&#8217;t Gino&#8217;s, either.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, February 18, Jasmine Pineda took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/90dayfiance/reel/DGOC-Fzga0X/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to announce to <em>90 Day Fiance</em> fans that she is pregnant. </p>



<p>As fans may recall, Jasmine and Gino have clashed about evolving ideas about having a child together (along with every other potential conflict imaginable, including a memorable meltdown in which Jasmine screamed about paint colors). But since Gino is not the father, it seems that their conflict is now moot.</p>

<p>Jasmine Pineda&#8217;s announcement comes through TLC. Gino Palazzolo does not show up as part of the happy news.</p>



<p>Coco, Jasmine&#8217;s dog, does. So does her apparent new man, Matt Branis.</p>



<p>As for the pregnancy itself, Jasmine appears to be pretty far along. It&#8217;s likely that she&#8217;s spent months hiding that baby bump due to contractual concerns. Perhaps she had to wait until TLC introduced the baby daddy to viewers on <em>90 Day: The Last Resort</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-exactly-happened-with-gino">What exactly happened with Gino?</h2>



<p>In June of 2023, Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo married. The idea was that they were going to live their happily ever after together in Michigan. </p>



<p>That is not how it worked out. It seems that the two of them were the <em>only </em>ones who did not already know that.</p>



<p>This season of <em>90 Day: The Last Resort</em> has shown the two of them grappling with intimacy issues. Amongst other things.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got into a big fight because I won&#8217;t sleep with her in the same bed,&#8221; Gino admitted to his castmates. </p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be intimate with someone unless I have a strong connection with them,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;And this morning Jasmine&#8217;s accusing me [of being] a porn addict, which I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>



<p>We here at <em>THG </em>have been critical of some of Gino&#8217;s choices in the past, but he&#8217;s right. Porn addiction is not real. He has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/90-day-fiance-couples-fight-over-broken-elevator-unflushed-toilet-and-cats-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many issues</a> (as does Jasmine), but a fictional addiction is not one of them.</p>

<p>On <em>90 Day: The Last Resort</em>, Jasmine said that the current issue with Gino made her want to expand their relationship. </p>



<p>Gino had been skeptical of the idea of an open marriage, especially given that Jasmine has screamed at him and broken down crying if he merely speaks to a waitress.</p>



<p>However, this gave Jasmine the excuse to introduce Matt Branis. She only chatted with him via video chat at the time. However, she said that she hoped that he would become a third member of her relationship at the time.</p>

<p>Now, it appears that Gino is no longer in the picture, and he is quite literally not in the announcement photos with a pregnant Jasmine, with Matt, and with Coco. </p>



<p>Unanswered questions remain &#8212; and perhaps <em>The Last Resort </em>will answer a few of them.</p>



<p>For now, our heartfelt congratulations go to Jasmine!</p>

<p><em>90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After?</em> stars Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda had divorce rumors escalating all through 2024.</p>



<p>Simply put, many fans believed that they&#8217;d only remained &#8220;together&#8221; for this long because they spent most of their time apart. Without absence to make their hearts grow fonder, a split seemed inevitable.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/90-day-fiance-gino-jasmine-fight-knife-dane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gino and Jasmine&#8217;s screaming fights</a> meant a toxic marriage. Money troubles, baby arguments, and (alleged) cheating pushed things over the edge.</p>



<p>Are Jasmine and Gino really filming for <em>90 Day: The Single Life?</em> Gino may have a new girlfriend &#8230; but he might not be done with Jasmine for good.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-90-day-fiance-stars-gino-palazzo-and-jasmine-pineda-stirred-divorce-rumors-all-year">&#8217;90 Day Fiance&#8217; stars Gino Palazzo and Jasmine Pineda stirred divorce rumors all year</h2>



<p>In early 2024, <em>90 Day Fiance</em> viewers were watching Jasmine&#8217;s journey as she adjusted to life in Michigan with Gino.</p>



<p>Despite his disgusting bathroom surprise and numerous other shortcomings of the house, it was supposed to be the start of their happily ever after in America.</p>



<p>But they didn&#8217;t leave their relationship problems &#8212; or various behavioral pathologies &#8212; behind in Panama. From various <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/jasmine-teases-wedding-ultimatum-to-gino-on-90-day-fiance-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimatums</a> to bitter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/jasmine-tosses-her-ring-ditches-gino-on-90-day-fiance-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic break-ups</a>, Gino and Jasmine&#8217;s divorce seemed inevitable.</p>

Her outbursts often undercut her actual point.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>At first, it looked like whatever semblance of sanity Jasmine possessed was unraveling in America. She was clashing with Gino&#8217;s family (though we should note that they took her side at times), she missed her own family, and she was <em>not </em>loving the winter wonderland in Michigan.</p>



<p>However, if you looked on social media, Gino and Jasmine seemed far from divorce. But then, as veterans of the <em>90 Day Fiance</em> franchise, they&#8217;d know how to abide by their NDA.</p>



<p>At most jobs, an NDA means not leaking corporate secrets. For reality TV, an NDA can mean pretending on Instagram to still be married to someone whom you despise. Your <em>real life</em> becomes a &#8220;spoiler.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-gino-palazzolo-get-a-new-girlfriend">Did Gino Palazzolo get a new girlfriend?</h2>



<p>Over the summer of 2024, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/90dayfianceuncensored/comments/1dssiok/ginos_new_girlfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> user took note of Gino Palazzolo and a woman appearing in a &#8220;My good friend&#8221; Instagram Story post that identified them as &#8220;Besties.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Reddit denizen in question did not identify them as &#8220;besties,&#8221; but rather as boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>



<p>At least one good thing came of Gino&#8217;s messy relationship with Jasmine: he wears <em>fantastic </em>shirts these days. Unfortunately, the Reddit post is now deleted. (It was unconfirmed anyway)</p>

<p>As for Jasmine Pineda, remember her &#8220;fitness trainer,&#8221; Matt Branis? </p>



<p>According to <em>90 Day Fiance</em> bloggers, Jasmine is showing off her alleged boyfriend on social media even though she is not allowed to identify him as such. Just as Gino is not with his rumored new girlfriend.</p>



<p>(There are allegations that she cheated on Gino, as you&#8217;ll see on this Shabooty Tea <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C88UiSZR7_V/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-were-they-both-filming-for-90-day-the-single-life-separately">Were they BOTH filming for &#8217;90 Day: The Single Life&#8217; (separately)?</h2>



<p>As that Shabooty post from early in the summer of 2024 alleged, Gino and Jasmine may have both been filming <em>90 Day: The Single Life</em>. </p>



<p>While established couples have filmed that spinoff before (<em>every day</em>, we&#8217;re thankful that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/90-day-big-ed-liz-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liz Woods</a> finally got away from Big Ed Brown), it <em>primarily </em>exists for <em>90 Day</em> exes to look for love again.</p>



<p>It would be wild (yet totally on-brand) for this franchise to film Jasmine and Gino on simultaneous quests for love. Then, in early August, came this sighting of Gino Palazzolo, a camera crew, and &#8230; someone else.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A viewer found Gino in the wild filming in Las Vegas with a woman who looks like Jasmine! Credit to 90dayfianceupdate on IG.<br><br>The person who filmed this thought they heard them call her Jasmine, but it looks like a different girl.<br><br>Probably filming The Single Life.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/90Dayfiance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#90Dayfiance</a> <a href="https://t.co/dY1TSTwC9U">pic.twitter.com/dY1TSTwC9U</a></p>— Starcasm (@starcasm) <a href="https://twitter.com/starcasm/status/1821094236751581447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>We here at <em>THG </em>can neither confirm nor deny that this woman is Jasmine Pineda. She certainly <em>looks </em>like her. Maybe Gino has a type, or maybe Jasmine has had another &#8220;update&#8221; to her appearance that makes her just <em>slightly </em>too hard to recognize at a distance.</p>



<p>Numerous fans wondered if Gino and Jasmine would sign divorce papers on the <em>90 Day: The Single Life</em> Tell All special. They wouldn&#8217;t even have been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/tania-maduro-and-syngin-colchester-divorce-on-camera-in-a-tell-all-first/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first couple</a> to do so. </p>



<p>Then, news came that Gino and Jasmine would appear on <em>90 Day: The Last Resort</em>. This was a shock to viewers who thought that they&#8217;d make it. It came as no real surprise to fans who followed reports of their marital troubles online.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-gino-and-jasmine-really-divorce">Why did Gino and Jasmine really divorce?</h2>



<p>As <em>90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After?</em> Season 8, Jasmine very directly told Gino that she wasn&#8217;t up to have a baby with him.</p>



<p>In her late 30s, it would be a geriatric pregnancy. And Jasmine is already a mom, with her boys nearing their teens.</p>



<p>However, fans believe that fundamental relationship insecurities played a larger roll than anything else. Simply put, even if they had once agreed on having a child together, Jasmine was no longer sure.</p>

<p>Jasmine Pineda had a screaming meltdown in Gino&#8217;s car when she discovered a tube of lip gloss in the vehicle.</p>



<p>Why? Well, Gino had to be coached to buy the (excellent) shirts that he currently wears. He&#8217;s not exactly a lip gloss guy. So, upon finding it, Jasmine assumed that Gino had cheated.</p>



<p>They even revisited the incident at the Tell All. On the one hand, Jasmine doesn&#8217;t need an excuse to throw a tantrum. She is famously unstable, and once screamed and cried about wall paint on a house she&#8217;d never visited. But &#8230; what if she also had a guilty conscience?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-jasmine-really-cheat-with-this-matt-branis-guy">Did Jasmine really cheat with this Matt Branis guy?</h2>



<p>Some <em>90 Day Fiance</em> fans speculate that Jasmine freaked out about Gino because she had a guilty conscience. There is ample <em>anecdotal </em>evidence suggesting that some cheaters are likely to accuse their spouses of cheating.</p>



<p>Setting aside her cruel taunts about Dane, with whom she likely did <em>not </em>cheat, the claims of her cheating have become accepted as &#8220;fact&#8221; by many fans. That&#8217;s possibly unfair to her, and certainly unfair to Matt &#8212; who is not a public figure, and has not had a chance to defend himself.</p>



<p>However, the fan consensus seems to be that the final nail in the coffin of Gino and Jasmine&#8217;s marriage was her cheating on him in early 2024. Even the wildest roller coasters must come to an end.</p>

<p>On <em>90 Day Fiance</em>, Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda had their latest fight. It involved a breakup threat, ex-related taunting, and &#8212; a huge knife?!</p>



<p>Last month, we saw <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/jasmine-teases-wedding-ultimatum-to-gino-on-90-day-fiance-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jasmine threaten a wedding ultimatum</a> to Gino. But she <em>also </em>had a confession to make.</p>



<p>She opened up to Gino about how ex-boyfriend Dane helped to pay for her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/jasmine-confesses-to-getting-butt-implants-to-horrified-gino-thanks-for-the-booty-babe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new butt implants</a>.</p>



<p>To no one&#8217;s surprise, this led to another screaming fight. </p>

<p>The couple were dealing with the fallout from Jasmine finally admitting that $2,000 of her $10,000 butt implants had come from her ex, Dane.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2">Is it any surprise that Gino was unhappy? And is it any surprise that the two couldn&#8217;t handle this like mature adults?</p>

<p>To his credit, Gino (while washing a truly farcical volume of veggies, in line with Jasmine&#8217;s dietary demands) admitted that he was in a bad mood.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gino-took-things-to-a-weird-place">Gino took things to a weird place</h2>



<p>Perhaps given his own history with sugar babies, Gino asked Jasmine if Dane expected anything back from her.</p>



<p>She explained that he did not. Dane, who seems to be a successful guy, is &#8220;an altruist person.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jasmine likened this $2,000 butt implant loan to a &#8220;charity.&#8221; That&#8217;s a bit much &#8212; just say that he&#8217;s <em>generous </em>and move on.</p>

<p>This was not simply a colossal betrayal.</p>



<p>As we reported at the time, that photo made it to various blogs and to her place of work &#8212; and Jasmine lost her job as a teacher. According to Jasmine, Gino&#8217;s ex did it.</p>



<p>For reasons that we cannot fully understand, Gino asked Jasmine if she had &#8220;provoked&#8221; his ex. This isn&#8217;t just victim-blaming &#8212; it&#8217;s a <em>bizarre </em>question.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-13">“All the f&#8211;king trauma I went through,&#8221; Jasmine exclaimed during her <em>90 Day</em> fight with Gino.</p>

<p>During all of this, Jasmine was still holding the knife that she had been using to slice vegetables. Thankfully, despite her fury, nothing ever came of it. </p>

<p>To be clear, no-contact with all exes would be an <em>extreme </em>sanction for most relationships.</p>



<p>But Gino and Jasmine do not have most relationships. Neither of them possess the maturity or the emotional intelligence to deal with these complexities.</p>



<p>So, Jasmine sent a voice memo to Dane to thank him for his years of friendship, praise him, and also to cut off all contact.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-30">“Our exes are dead to us,&#8221; Jasmine said to Gino. &#8220;They died.”</p>



<p>That is a little dramatic.</p>



<p>But these two <em>90 Day Fiance</em> clowns are <em>always </em>dramatic. Gino and Jasmine will fight again, but it will be over something else.</p>

First of all, cultures have a lot of variety and beauty, but right and wrong are immutable. More importantly in this instance, bachelor parties being common doesn&#8217;t mean that concealing one is. It&#8217;s not. This is neither normal nor okay. But Gino is acting as though Jasmine is unreasonable for being upset. Many times, she has been! But not this time.</p></figure>

Sometimes, painful conversation lead to tears. Gino is hurting her feelings, and he&#8217;s supposed to love and support her. That said, Jasmine does go overboard, which is perhaps why Gino feels justified in completely ignoring her feelings. It&#8217;s like the two of them are playing off of each other in a vicious cycle. Her every tantrum makes him more numb, and his numbness hurts her until she has a new tantrum.</p></figure>

We don&#8217;t refer to &#8220;normal&#8221; abuse where someone is throwing dishes or destroying a child&#8217;s toys; that happens because an evil person uses pain and fear to torment and terrorize their families. This is a more subtle dynamic, sometimes referred to as &#8220;things-destroyers,&#8221; where a partner who is otherwise not abuse destroys important belongings or keepsakes. Some classic Reddit (r/relationships and AITA, anyone?) include shredding a girlfriend&#8217;s prom photo, trashing a boyfriend&#8217;s LEGO collection, throwing a girlfriend&#8217;s plants into a lake, tearing up a girlfriend&#8217;s knitting project. Perhaps the most haunting of all was a man who took a mallet and destroyed the ring of his wife&#8217;s late husband. Jasmine tearing apart a napkin from Gino&#8217;s 40th birthday isn&#8217;t on that level &#8212; but it&#8217;s also not okay.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>

<p>In the aftermath of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/did-gino-cheat-on-jasmine-where-did-the-lip-gloss-come-from/">Jasmine suspecting Gino of cheating</a>, it looks like things have calmed down.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know if they had real resolution or solid answers about the lip gloss. But Jasmine has resolved to be less jealous.</p>



<p>That is, until she speaks with her future sister-in-law &#8230; perhaps the only <em>real </em>ally she has in Gino&#8217;s family.</p>



<p>Speaking to Michelle is how Jasmine learns that Gino violated her trust. And this time, it&#8217;s not just suspicions and hysterics.</p>

<p>In this sneak peek of the Sunday, November 19 episode, Jasmina Pineda sits down to chat with sister-in-law Michelle. (You can watch the full sneak peek video below)</p>



<p>We all know that Jasmine has lashed out in fits of extreme, often wildly irrational jealousy and anger over Gino.</p>



<p>Michelle must be aware of at least some part of that. At this point, Jasmine&#8217;s been interrogating Gino about standard politeness to waitresses and similar things for <em>years</em>. </p>

<p>So, during this clip, Michelle is suggesting to Jasmine that they have a girls night in some form.</p>



<p>Right now, Jasmine and Gino are around each other at all times. Jasmine jokes about all of the things that she does for him, and admits that she could really use a break.</p>



<p>This is when Michelle notes that it&#8217;s only right that they have a get-together. After all, Gino already had his bachelor party.</p>

This is not what she expected to hear.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, Jasmine&#8217;s shock is very visible.</p>



<p>She had been under the distinct impression that Gino wasn&#8217;t going to have a bachelor party &#8212; not without her being there to plan it. She believed this because it&#8217;s what Gino told her.</p>



<p>Michelle details that Gino&#8217;s bachelor party took place the day before Jasmine arrived in Michigan. Oh, and it took place at a strip club.</p>

<p>In addition to her general emotional instability, Jasmine has a lot of insecurities.</p>



<p>So she asks Michelle if a woman touched Gino while he was at his party.</p>



<p>Michelle says that she feels &#8220;sure&#8221; that it happened. It was his bachelor party. (Just for the record, I don&#8217;t think that strippers are really supposed to touch you)</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am, feeling guilty for getting mad at Gino, being very hard on myself,&#8221; Jasmine complains to the confessional camera.</p>



<p>She says that she has been &#8220;blaming everything on me, like, yes, maybe, you know, I&#8217;m too jealous.&#8221; Yes, that&#8217;s true.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have trust issues after finding all these things from his exes,&#8221; Jasmine acknowledges. &#8220;But I should have trusted my instinct because I was right.&#8221;</p>

Yet.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jasmine then tells Michelle that Gino now &#8220;in big trouble.&#8221; Oof.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gino is keeping secrets from me,&#8221; she then tells the camera.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to keep it cool in front of Michelle,&#8221; Jasmine says menacingly. &#8220;But all I want to do is go home and face Gino.&#8221;</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="90 Day Fiancé: Jasmine Is LIVID After Finding Out Gino Had a Bachelor Party (Exclusive)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgZJACV8NI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>What&#8217;s interesting here is that it&#8217;s a reminder that Jasmine&#8217;s insecurities didn&#8217;t manifest out of thin air.</p>



<p>Maybe Gino didn&#8217;t cheat with a <em>lip gloss floozy</em>, but he did send Jasmine&#8217;s nudes to an ex to make her jealous. And he lies to Jasmine at times in ways that only come back to haunt him.</p>



<p>None of this excuses Jasmine&#8217;s behavior, but it is a factor in it.</p>

<p>Of course, Jasmine&#8217;s ability to keep calm in front of Michelle shows us what we&#8217;ve known all along: she has the ability to do this at any time.</p>



<p>Every tantrum, every freakout that she has in front of Gino is a choice. Jasmine decides to &#8220;lose control.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s <em>despicable </em>behavior. Jasmine cannot keep doing this to herself or to Gino.</p>

<p>On the latest episode of <em>90 Day Fiance</em>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/jasmine-and-gino-have-screaming-fight-over-lipgloss-on-90-day-fiance-recap/">Gino and Jasmine had a screaming fight</a> &#8230; over lip gloss.</p>



<p>Truth be told, the lip gloss was just the spark that ignited the wildfire. It set Jasmine ablaze with suspicion.</p>



<p>But &#8230; did Gino <em>actually </em>cheat on Jasmine?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at the facts.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-487172" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1113_ginopalazzolo_06.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jasmine did her best to make a positive impression on Gino&#8217;s relatives.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happened">What happened?</h2>



<p>On Season 10, Episode 6 of <em>90 Day Fiance</em>, Jasmine Pineda finally met Gino Palazzolo&#8217;s family.</p>



<p>She has perceived them as adversaries for a long time. Particularly after at least one confrontational message on social media.</p>



<p>When she finally met them, she did her level best to make a good impression. </p>

<p>And some of the footage vindicated her &#8212; because some straight-up xenophobic relatives of Gino (not all of them, but some) had resolved to dislike and mistrust her from the start.</p>



<p>Even so, on the ride home, Gino asked Jasmine to give them a chance. And Jasmine promised to try. Meeting them in person had shown her that some, at least, were supportive.</p>



<p>Then, she dropped her phone, reached down to grab it, and uncovered a tube of lip gloss.</p>

<p>Most people would think nothing off finding a small, easy-to-lose makeup tool in a car. Yes, even in the car of a man who might not be entirely clear on what lip gloss is.</p>



<p>Having questions isn&#8217;t unreasonable, though. Since Gino doesn&#8217;t wear lip gloss, it must be someone&#8217;s. Maybe they could return it to them.</p>



<p>But Jasmine had already decided that it belonged to some side piece of Gino&#8217;s. And, to be fair, he acted shifty and began stammering as he often does when he&#8217;s nervous about what he&#8217;s going to say.</p>

<p>Because Jasmine fundamentally cannot be normal about things, she screamed and wailed and wept. She accused him of cheating.</p>



<p>Gino fired plenty of insults back at her. This did not improve the situation. He also denied cheating.</p>



<p>Their segment of Episode 6 ended with Jasmine wandering around sobbing in a cold parking lot. It was sad, and arguably comical. But &#8230; did Gino actually cheat?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-gino-did-cheat">What if Gino did cheat?</h2>



<p>In the past, Gino has obviously dated other women. He paid for dates with sugar babies, which shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal but Jasmine decided that it was. </p>



<p>More significantly, Gino sent Jasmine&#8217;s nudes to his ex (which should have been a dealbreaker all by itself) in an effort to brag. Or possibly make her jealous.</p>



<p>We cannot entirely rule out that Gino cheated on Jasmine at some point. But it&#8217;s not the most likely situation &#8212; and certainly not the only possibility.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-jasmine-just-invent-a-scenario-that-upset-her">Did Jasmine just invent a scenario that upset her?</h2>



<p>People&#8217;s mind invent upsetting scenarios all of the time. Especially if they have anxiety disorders.</p>



<p>Most of us don&#8217;t make it someone else&#8217;s problem. Jasmine is not most people. We&#8217;ve seen her throw tantrums over nothing, working herself up into a frenzy.</p>



<p>Her behavior is absolutely unacceptable. And while it wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate even if Gino <em>had </em>cheated, we can&#8217;t rule out that Jasmine leapt to the wrong conclusion and exploded over it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-gino-plant-the-lip-gloss-for-some-weird-reason">Did Gino plant the lip gloss for some weird reason?</h2>



<p>Some wonder if Gino planted the lip gloss for whatever reason. Maybe he wanted to get a rise out of her, or make sure that they make a splash this season, or even an excuse to break up with her.</p>



<p>This sounds more like creativity and wishful thinking on the part of fans.</p>



<p>Folks &#8230; Gino didn&#8217;t even think to wash his nasty sheets or <em>even flush the toilet </em>before Jasmine arrived. So no, we don&#8217;t think that he&#8217;s planting borderline-gaslighting props.</p>

<p>What about Jasmine? She&#8217;s a little more clever and devious than people give her credit for.</p>



<p>The thing is that we&#8217;re not sure if she&#8217;s that good of an actress. It&#8217;s <em>possible</em>, sure. </p>



<p>But if Jasmine cannot fake happiness or calm for a single moment, can she fake hysterics? <em>90 Day Fiance</em> couples are, believe it or not, more authentic than a lot of viewers assume.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-producers-plant-the-lip-gloss-to-create-problems-on-purpose">Did producers plant the lip gloss to create problems on purpose?</h2>



<p>The final suspicion that we&#8217;ve seen from viewers is that a producer could have planted it to cause problems.</p>



<p>Folks, that is not how this works. That is never, in the history of this franchise, how this works.</p>



<p>The absolute <em>fakest </em>that <em>90 Day Fiance </em>production has been was suggesting questions to friends of cast members to ask on camera. And that&#8217;s usually a scandal when it happens.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-where-did-the-lip-gloss-come-from">So where did the lip gloss come from?</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t know, but the best guess is that, at some point, Gino had a passenger. Some passengers wear lip gloss. Lip gloss sometimes falls onto the floors of cars. That&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>All evidence strongly supports <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/gino-and-jasmine-spotted-fighting-filming-in-michigan-will-they-join-90-day-fiance-happily-ever-after/">Gino and Jasmine still being together</a>. So in the unlikely event that he cheated, she seems to have forgiven him.</p>



<p>To jump to an outlandish conclusion after spotting an anonymous tube of lip gloss &#8230; well, you&#8217;d have to be unstable and paranoid.</p>
