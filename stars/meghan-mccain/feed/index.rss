<p>“I cannot stand her,” the 40-year old, said on the February 19 episode of Meghan McCain’s Happy Hour digital series. </p>



<p>“I love people that I can relate to, like every other 40-year-old mom. I don’t want to eat her jam. I love Princess Kate [Middleton].”</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time McCain has criticized Markle. She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-mccain-meghan-markle-feud/">also blasted Markle after seeing the trailer</a> for her relatively new Netflix series, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-unveils-trailer-for-new-netflix-cooking-show-gets-roasted-by-savage-critics/">With Love, From Meghan</a></em>.</p>



<p>“I was originally a Meghan Markle supporter, I thought she was cool, stylish and refreshing. Like the rest of the world my opinion changed when she disrespected the royal family,” McCain Tweeted several weeks ago.</p>



<p>“Now that she wants to be American again instead of British aristocracy what she seems to forget is Americans want real, raw, uncensored. All of this even in the trailer is highly curated, produced and out of touch.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan Markle on October 5, 2024." class="wp-image-519519" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0218_meghanmarkle_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markleattends the 2024 Children&#8217;s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Gala at L.A.

<p>As for what prompted McCain&#8217;s trashing of Markle in this new case?</p>



<p>Earlier in the week, the mother of two announced via social media that she was renaming her lifestyle brand from American Riviera Orchard to As Ever.</p>



<p>“As ever means ‘as it’s always been’ or some even say ‘in the same way as always,’” Markle explained via Instagram on Tuesday.</p>



<p> “If you’ve followed along since my days of creating The Tig, you’ll know this couldn’t be truer for me. </p>



<p>&#8220;This new chapter is an extension of what has always been my love language, beautifully weaving together everything I cherish — food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="741" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1024x741.jpg" alt="Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagement at The Sunken Gardens at Kensington Palace on November 27, 2017 in London, England." class="wp-image-517126" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-2048x1481.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-960x694.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1080x781.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1200x868.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagement at The Sunken Gardens at Kensington Palace on November 27, 2017 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After seeing the video announcement, McCain said she was be confused with what Markle is trying to pull off here.</p>



<p>“I don’t know what she’s doing,” the TV personality told guests Perez Hilton and Mary Katharine Ham. “This is, like, her ninth rebrand. I actually had to review her show and her podcast, and it was horrible. It was so boring.”</p>



<p>Previously, McCain expressed disdain for Markle trying to be the next Martha Stewart.</p>



<p>“I would have told her to do a show helping bring fresh food to food deserts in low income neighborhoods,” she said. “Do something to help people instead of your ego.”</p>

<p>During her latest Happy Hour installment, McCain advised Markle, saying she should look to ex-First Lady Michelle Obama as an example of someone who is “very real,&#8221; adding on air:</p>



<p>“She has actually had some of the best marriage advice I’ve ever heard from anyone,” McCain said. </p>



<p>“When I first got pregnant, Michelle Obama had this quote where she was like, ‘Women can have it all, but they can’t have it all at once.’ Your career is inevitably going to suffer if you have a child in one form or another. </p>



<p>&#8220;For me, it was the honesty of that. Meghan Markle’s never going to say, ‘I can’t have it all at once.’”</p>

<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-unveils-trailer-for-new-netflix-cooking-show-gets-roasted-by-savage-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle released the first trailer</a> for her new Netflix lifestyle show.</p>



<p>The series, titled <em>With Love, From Meghan</em>, features the duchess and her celebrity pals cooking meals, arranging flowers, and offering a wide array of tips and tricks for aspiring hosts and hostesses</p>



<p>In other words, it&#8217;s Meghan&#8217;s way of confirming her intention to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become her generation&#8217;s Martha Stewart</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-new-show-meets-with-criticism">Meghan&#8217;s New Show Meets With Criticism</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Martha&#8217;s successs might be a product of a bygone era. </p>



<p>These days, dinner parties are mostly a thing of the past, and folks who are in need of culinary tips are probably finding them on TikTok.</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-slammed-for-embarrassing-detail-in-new-years-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s latest Netflix project</a> is receiving such an icy reception. </p>



<p>When the trailer debuted on YouTube, haters rushed to the comments section to blast the Duchess of Sussex for being &#8220;tone deaf&#8221; and &#8220;out of touch.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="665" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1024x665.png" alt="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a scene from her new Netflix show." class="wp-image-515841" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1024x665.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-300x195.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-768x499.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-2048x1330.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-960x623.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1080x701.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1200x779.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a scene from her new Netflix show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And now, Meghan has attracted the unwanted attention of one very high-profile critic: media personality and self-described political nepo-baby Meghan McCain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-vs-meghan">Meghan vs. Meghan</h2>





<p>“I was originally a Meghan Markle supporter, I thought she was cool, stylish and refreshing. Like the rest of the world my opinion changed when she disrespected the royal family,” <a href="https://x.com/MeghanMcCain/status/1874951878108455131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McCain wrote </a>on X (formerly Twitter) today.</p>



<p>“Now that she wants to be American again instead of British aristocracy what she seems to forget is Americans want real, raw, uncensored. All of this even in the trailer is highly curated, produced and out of touch.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>From there, McCain cited the recent rash of terroristic violence in the US and accused the other Meghan of announcing her posh new project at an inappropriate time.</p>



<p>&#8220;There have been 2 terror attacks in 2 days, major wars raging and Americans can’t pay for groceries. We are a country in rage, uncertainty and intensity right now,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;This concept is ill advised. I would have told her to do a show helping bring fresh food to food deserts in low income neighborhoods. Do something to help people instead of your ego,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is why the world doesn’t like you, nothing else. Just completely and utterly tone deaf to the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>McCain&#8217;s remarks echo many of the reactions to the show on YouTube and across social media.</p>



<p>(Although in asserting that &#8220;the world&#8221; doesn&#8217;t like Meghan, McCain went a bit further than most anonymous trolls.)</p>



<p>Obviously, these judgments are premature, as the eight-episode series doesn&#8217;t premiere until January 15.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-lot-on-the-line">A Lot on the Line</h2>

<p>But Team Meghan might be feeling a bit nervous at the moment, as the stakes for this project couldn&#8217;t be higher.</p>



<p>Meghan and Prince Harry signed a lucrative deal with Netflix back in 2020, and thus far, the couple has yet to deliver any huge hits.</p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s latest project, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-distancing-themselves-from-polo-series-amid-dismal-reviews-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a docuseries about the world of professional polo</a>, was met with bad reviews and minimal viewership.</p>



<p>Insiders say that after a disappointing 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-returns-to-instagram-rings-in-2025-with-stunning-video-shot-by-prince-harry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry are hoping to make a comeback</a> in the new year.</p>



<p>So they&#8217;d better hope that Netflix subscribers don&#8217;t arrive at the same conclusion that Meghan McCain reached. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll have one more setback to overcome.</p>

<p>Has <em>The View </em>really been canceled?</p>



<p>Over the years, the legendary talk show has been a place for both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/jenna-lyons-reveals-her-hair-teeth-are-fake-due-to-genetic-condition-that-inspired-her-fashion-career/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heartfelt conversations</a> and some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/joy-behar-blackface-photo-emerges-view-host-comes-under-major-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nauseating scandals</a>. <em>The View</em> has produced viral moments and memes and more.</p>



<p>Now, a persistent rumor suggests that ABC is canceling the daytime series. Even more alarming, for weeks the show has been flip-flopping between live episodes and previously recorded shows.</p>



<p>So, is it really over? And if so &#8211; WHY?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-view-amp-it-s-legacy">&#8216;The View&#8217; &amp; It&#8217;s Legacy </h2>



<p><em>The View</em> premiered on ABC in 1997 after legendary journalist Barbara Walters created and, for years, hosted it.</p>



<p>The daytime talk show features multiple generations of women. Many of them are experts in their fields, others just famous faces, but all of them have something to say about &#8220;hot topics&#8221; from politics to culture and beyond.</p>



<p>This August marks the 27th anniversary of <em>The View</em>. It has been a mainstay of ABC&#8217;s daytime programming block for nearly three decades.</p>



<p>Which is why it feels weird that new episodes have been few and far between. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-people-still-love-watching-the-view">People Still Love Watching &#8216;The View&#8217; </h2>



<p>Ostensibly, viewers tune in to ABC&#8217;s long-running daytime talk series for a combination of celebrity commentary, relatable takes, and even legal expertise.</p>



<p>From journalists to famous actors to legal professionals to nepo babies to reality TV personalities, <em>The View </em>boasts an array of different points of view. It sort of goes with the name.</p>



<p>Some would argue that the panel being all-women is just a gimmick. Others would say that it&#8217;s refreshing to go a few minutes every day without hearing men&#8217;s opinions on current events &#8212; since male voices tend to overwhelmingly dominate so many aspects of life, entertainment, and culture.</p>

<p>Obviously, Barbara Walters was a living legend, but a rotation of notable woman have followed her at the table.</p>



<p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell was quite the character, and very memorable during her time on the show. Sherri Shepherd once sat on the panel, but now has her own show, having taken the timeslot of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/wendy-williams-net-worth-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor Wendy Williams</a>.</p>



<p>Even people who are mostly famous for their time on <em>The View </em>have produced, as we noted, memes and viral moments. The clip of Ana Navarro above is a prime example.</p>



<p>Often, short clips of the talk show &#8220;break containment&#8221; (that is, go well beyond their target audience of somewhat older women) and become widely popular. Especially when the hosts fight or do what we can only describe as <em>misbehave</em>.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hasselbeck was part of <em>The View </em>from 2003 through 2013. She didn&#8217;t win her Emmy Award for competing on <em>Survivor</em>, after all. She quickly became infamous for her, well, bad takes on a number of events.</p>



<p>Hasselbeck set a specific tone for the show. The network has since tried to replicate her role, casting other &#8220;villains&#8221; (for lack of a better term) like Candace Cameron Bure and Meghan McCain to instigate drama. </p>



<p>Notably, we&#8217;re not referring to conservative hosts, here. Nicolle Wallace &#8212; who worked for the George W. Bush White House&#8211; and Jedediah Bila, Ana Navarro, and Abby Huntsman are all noted conservatives. They never stepped into the &#8220;villain&#8221; roles like <em>some </em>others, however.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-running-low-on-villains-may-get-the-view-canceled">Running low on villains may get &#8216;The View&#8217; canceled</h2>



<p>For years, Meghan McCain held the role as <em>The View</em>&#8216;s primary antagonist. She would literally huff angrily while other hosts spoke, which was an unbecoming and childlike response to disagreements.</p>



<p>Obviously, a lot of people on social media were eager to see ABC show her the door. In July of 2021, McCain announced her upcoming departure, citing her family&#8217;s move.</p>



<p>But even as some viewers cheered, we couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if it&#8217;s good for the show to see such a dramatic person &#8212; one who&#8217;s right just enough of the time to keep you guessing, but is so often loudly wrong &#8212; leave. After all, <em>The View </em>survives on ratings, not on maintaining a moral and behavioral standard.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-the-view-really-been-canceled">Has &#8216;The View&#8217; Really Been Canceled?</h2>



<p>In the summer of 2023, rumors that <em>The View</em> is ending began to take root. Those rumors have continued into 2024 and have continued for MONTHS</p>



<p>However, as of July 2024, there are no indications &#8212; not from behind the scenes or any public announcements &#8212; that the rumors are true.</p>



<p>At present, ABC has not canceled <em>The View</em> and likely doesn&#8217;t plan to any time soon.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re worried about why there aren&#8217;t any new episodes the answer is quite simple: summer hiatus. </p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean big changes aren&#8217;t coming for the show. </p>



<p>“After 10 years and 2,143 episodes, this is the last show we’ll do from this studio,” Sunny Hostin revealed during an episode of the daytime talk show on August 2.</p>



<p>However, before the crowd could get too concerned that the show was being axed, Sunny explained that the show would be carrying on, but from a new location. </p>



<p>“We’re sad to say goodbye, but we are thrilled to be moving to a brand-new studio downtown — brand-new, state-of-the-art — and we will see you there in September for the premiere of season 28!” she said.</p>



<p>Phew! Close call!</p>

<p>Meghan McCain has some things to say about Jennifer Lopez.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s not the only one. J. Lo&#8217;s unpopularity may have reached a <em>tipping point</em>.</p>



<p>Amidst her flopped tour, a couple of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/atlas-ending-explained-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not very good movies</a>, and rumors of an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-tracker-their-house-is-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impending divorce from Ben Affleck</a>, she&#8217;s seen better days.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, criticism from Meghan McCain is a badge of honor. But this may be one of those rare cases where John McCain&#8217;s daughter is making some solid points.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jennifer-lopez-is-deeply-unpleasant-says-meghan-mccain">Jennifer Lopez is &#8216;deeply unpleasant,&#8217; says Meghan McCain</h2>



<p>Meghan McCain, former primary antagonist of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-view-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The View</a></em> and outspoken daughter of the late Senator John McCain, spoke on the Friday, June 7 episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/carlos-king-explains-why-rhonj-is-unwatchable/id1710616965?i=1000658152905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Citizen McCain</em> podcast</a>.</p>



<p>“I, too, share similar negative stories that the entire world does,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I feel bad because we’re turning a point where there’s bullying happening to J. Lo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meghan bluntly stated: “She just is a deeply unpleasant person.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more to Meghan McCain&#8217;s critique of Jennifer Lopez than simply the singer&#8217;s lack of people skills.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had the biggest entourage I’ve ever seen [when she was on&nbsp;‘The View’],&#8221; she recalled.</p>



<p>Meghan McCain alleged that she&#8217;d arrived with &#8220;More than&nbsp;Kim Kardashian&nbsp;and the president.” She added that she didn&#8217;t “really understand why it was needed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-jennifer-lopez-get-meghan-mccain-s-tiktok-video-taken-down">Did Jennifer Lopez get Meghan McCain&#8217;s TikTok video taken down?</h2>



<p>McCain alleged that Lopez &#8220;had our video taken down.&#8221; She then added an &#8220;allegedly,&#8221; as she has no proof to back up that claim.</p>



<p>Specifically, Meghan McCain had said on TikTok that Jennifer Lopez was not her &#8220;favorite&#8221; guest during her time on <em>The View</em>.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0"> Though McCain cannot confirm who reported her video (and was able to get it reinstated within hours), she seems to genuinely believe that J. Lo is behind the erstwhile takedown notice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0">Thinking back to Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s guest appearance on The View, she described finding the singer with one of her minions holding &#8220;a mirror with lights while they were touching her up backstage.&#8221;</p>



<p>That isn&#8217;t an accusation of bad behavior. It is, rather, a description of excessive behavior that McCain found to be unbecoming.</p>



<p>“I was a host at ‘The View,’ she was not nice,&#8221; Meghan McCain assessed. &#8220;You don’t always have to be so nice, but it was surprising that people like Kim Kardashian couldn’t be more delightful.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="844" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-844x1024.jpg" alt="Jennifer Lopez in May of 2024 for the Atlas premiere." class="wp-image-501519" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-844x1024.jpg 844w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-247x300.jpg 247w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-768x932.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-1687x2048.jpg 1687w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-791x960.jpg 791w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-890x1080.jpg 890w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-989x1200.jpg 989w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02.jpg 1980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez arrives at the premiere of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Atlas&#8221; at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood on May 20, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-most-celebrity-guests-can-at-least-pretend-to-be-friendly">Most celebrity guests can at least pretend to be friendly</h2>



<p>McCain then suggested: “When you’re coming on a show for a 10-minute segment … just fake it ’til you make it for 10 f–king minutes.”</p>



<p>Though that&#8217;s not generally what &#8220;fake it &#8217;til you make it&#8221; means, it&#8217;s otherwise not bad advice.</p>



<p>Most people can emulate friendliness for short periods of time, just to be polite or make a good impression. Of those who do not, the majority of people are making a choice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Jennifer Lopez on Her Journey to Happiness at 50 | The View" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7kFUsuBVDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>McCain&#8217;s account of Lopez matches a lot of the general reputation that she has. That said, a lack of friendliness is not an immoral behavior. It doesn&#8217;t leave a good impression, but it doesn&#8217;t make someone a bad person.</p>



<p>At the same time, many people who already believed Lopez to be a bad person are taking this as confirmation of existing <em>bad vibes</em>.</p>



<p>Numerous reports and anecdotal accounts describe <a href="https://www.shefinds.com/collections/jennifer-lopez-strict-rules-ben-affleck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez not tipping servers</a> and even insisting that Ben Affleck undertip or not tip servers. Unlike being unfriendly towards Meghan McCain, that alleged behavior <em>is </em>immoral. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="760" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1024x760.jpg" alt="Jennifer Lopez in early May of 2024." class="wp-image-501520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1024x760.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-300x223.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-768x570.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-2048x1521.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-960x713.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1080x802.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1200x891.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-said">That said &#8230;</h2>



<p>Some on social media have likened Meghan McCain&#8217;s issues with Jennifer Lopez to an <em>Alien vs Predator</em> conflict. This is a reference to that film&#8217;s tagline: &#8220;Whoever wins, we lose.&#8221;</p>



<p>McCain herself is notorious, and for more than just having a bloated entourage. From petulant on-camera behavior to having notoriously bad takes, she has spent the past decade and a half alienating most of her now-former fans.</p>



<p>Beefing with Jennifer Lopez is well and good. But perhaps Meghan McCain does not have much high ground in this feud.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>You know what they say about The View, right?</p>
<p>You can leave the daytime talk show behind, but this doesn&#8217;t mean that those who still make a living by talking about current events on that program will leave <em>you</em> alone.</p>
<p>Not very catchy or pithy.</p>
<p>But someone probably said it at least once.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s also a relevant saying at the moment because Meghan McCain &#8212; who <a href="/2021/07/meghan-mccain-see-ya-im-quitting-the-view/">departed The View back in July</a> &#8212; is once again feuding with Joy Behar.</p>
<p>For the most asinine of reasons.</p>
<p>It all started after McCain wrote a seemingly innocuous post on February 14, tagging her husband and writing simply:</p>
<p>&quot;Happy Valentines Day @bdomenech &ndash; I love you and am grateful every day for the life we have together.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In response to McCain&#8217;s message, a Twitter user asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Does every thought and sentiment need to be on Twitter?&quot;</p>
<p>And, in response to <em>that</em> remark, Behar wrote in a since-deleted tweet, <strong><em>Apparently</em></strong>.</p>
<p>What a random thing to get upset about, right? What an odd way to take a jab at a former co-worker/foe, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Imagine spending your Valentines Day trolling your ex colleagues tweet about her husband,&quot; fired back McCain on her social media page, alongside a screengrab of their Twitter exchange.</p>
<p>When Fox News host and weather anchor Janice Dean pointed out that Behar &quot;can&#8217;t quit you&quot;, McCain responded to her Tweet, referring to Behar&#8217;s actions as &quot;pathetic&quot; and adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It creeps me out.&quot;</p>
<p>In a since-deleted tweet off her own, McCain also wrote that walking away from The View &quot;is like having ex&#8217;s who won&#8217;t stop drunk texting you.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain left the show last summer, partly because she returned from maternity leave shortly beforehand &#8212; only for Behar to admit on air that she did NOT miss her conservative co-anchor.</p>
<p>In her memoir, McCain said she &quot;felt like [she&#8217;d] been slapped&quot; at the time, adding that she &quot;burst into tears&quot; and was &quot;uncontroll[ably] sobbing&quot; when they cut to commercial.</p>
<p>&quot;Until that moment it hadn&#8217;t even occurred to me that Joy hadn&#8217;t missed me,&quot; McCain wrote.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain alleges that when she asked for an apology from Behar over this snub, producers told her that no mea culpa was coming.</p>
<p>And this is when she knew what she had to go: quit.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a look at my life outside of myself and I thought clearly &#8212; this s&#8212; isn&#8217;t worth this,&quot; wrote McCain in the aforementioned book, adding elsewhere:</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;s supposed to be my friend and it&#8217;s supposed to be a sisterhood. I&#8217;ll never forget. I went back to my office and I had a panic attack. I was crying. I was hyperventilating. I threw up.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>McCain, meanwhile, also chimed in this month after Whoopi Goldberg claimed that the <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-holocaust-remarks/">Holocast wasn&#8217;t about race</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not calling for Whoopi Goldberg to be fired, if only because I don&#8217;t believe there is any universe where she could possibly do anything that could get her fired &#8212; she is the crown jewel of The View and a pop culture icon,&quot; <a href="/2022/02/meghan-mccain-destroys-whoopi-goldberg-her-half-assed-holocaust/">said McCain amid this controversy</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hope this can be used as a teachable moment to explain to millions of Americans why conflating the Holocaust as something that is specific and limited to &#8216;white people&#8217; is insane, ahistorical and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>&quot;For as much as the left is fond of using Nazi comparisons and imagery, the truth of the Holocaust, who it targeted and why, deserves to be known and understood by all.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldberd got suspended for two weeks by ABC for her comment and returned to work on Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Meghan McCain doesn&#8217;t think Whoopi Goldberg should be left off the hook.</p>
<p>Very, very far from it.</p>
<p>On Monday&#8217;s episode of The View,&nbsp;Goldberg made a very strange and wildly misguided statement&nbsp;during a conversation about the Tennessee school board&rsquo;s ban of &ldquo;Maus,&rdquo; a nonfiction graphic novel about cartoonist Art Spiegelman&rsquo;s father&#8217;s experience as a Holocaust survivor.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be truthful about it because [the] Holocaust isn&rsquo;t about race,&rdquo; Goldberg said in response at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about race.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s about man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unusual take drew immediate, sweeping criticism from Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the U.S. Holocaust Museum&#8230; and it led to an apology by Goldberg on Tuesday.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-1024x683.jpg" alt="Whoopi Goldberg on The View" class="wp-image-413425" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-on-the-view.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>&quot;I said something that I feel a responsibility for not leaving unexamined because my words upset so many people, which was never my intention,&quot; the actress said on air yesterday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;And I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got was really helpful and it helped me understand some different things.&quot;</p>
<p>The Holocaust &quot;is indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race,&quot; Goldberg continued, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Now, words matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know, and as you all know because I&rsquo;ve always done that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sincere words? Maybe.</p>
<p>But <a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-race-based-holocaust/">ABC suspended Goldberg on Tuesday night</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,&quot; ABC News President Kim Godwin said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;While Whoopi has apologized, I&#8217;ve asked her to take time and reflect and learn about the impact of her comments.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family, and communities.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This brings us back to Meghan McCain.</p>
<p>The former View co-host penned a damning op/ed for The Daily Mail on Tuesday, trashing Goldberg&#8217;s mea culpa a &quot;half-assed apology&quot; and taking her to task for previous remarks about Roman Polaski and Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>&quot;I was lectured to thousands of times on The View, there is a belief that &#8216;cancel culture&#8217; is really &#8216;accountability culture&#8217; among the woke left,&quot; wrote McCain.</p>
<p>&quot;Which seems to be a belief that&#8217;s quickly forgotten whenever it&#8217;s Whoopi who has to be held to account.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>To be clear, McCain wrote all of this before Goldberg&#8217;s suspension was announced.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not calling for Whoopi Goldberg to be fired, if only because I don&#8217;t believe there is any universe where she could possibly do anything that could get her fired &#8212; she is the crown jewel of The View and a pop culture icon,&quot; continued to daughter of former Presidential nominee John McCain.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hope this can be used as a teachable moment to explain to millions of Americans why conflating the Holocaust as something that is specific and limited to &#8216;white people&#8217; is insane, ahistorical and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>&quot;For as much as the left is fond of using Nazi comparisons and imagery, the truth of the Holocaust, who it targeted and why, deserves to be known and understood by all.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain believes &quot;liberal hosts are held to an entirely different standard than anyone else,&quot; adding in her piece:</p>
<p>&quot;Whoopi has said a slew of insanely-controversial and hurtful things over the course of her tenure at The View.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the more notorious ones include defending Roman Polanski for raping a 13-year-old (calling it &#8216;not rape, rape&#8217;) and defending Bill Cosby after over 50 accusers had come out publicly with their stories.</p>
<p>&quot;With age and status comes protection at The View.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>McCain went on to asserted that some folks &quot;will never face the same ramifications and repercussions that others will,&quot; referring to this as a &quot;double, triple, and even quadruple standard if you are conservative.&quot;</p>
<p>She cited Roseanne Barr and Sharon Osbourne as examples of so-called canceled Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;There are those who will be given protection and coverage for their bad behavior from networks and executives no matter what,&quot; McCain wrote.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="856" height="880" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic.png" alt="Meghan McCain View Pic" class="wp-image-332521" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic.png 856w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-292x300.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-768x790.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-735x756.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-326x335.png 326w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-338x347.png 338w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-506x520.png 506w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-623x640.png 623w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-747x768.png 747w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Toward the end of her op-ed, McCain mentioned that The View founder Barbara Walters is &quot;one of the most famous Jewish American women in American history&quot; and that she doesn&#8217;t believe &quot;a show of one myopic opinion was her intention.&quot;</p>
<p>No response yet to this scathing criticism from McCain.</p>
<p>Not frrom Goldberg and not from ABC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Meghan McCain is a woman with many opinions.</p>
<p>Some of them may be ridiculous and almost all of them are based off a life of extreme privilege, but give the former talk show host at least a tiny bit of credit:</p>
<p>She&#8217;s never been afraid to spout said opinions.</p>
<p>(Probably because she could always afford to do so based on all that privilege. But still.)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>McCain has a new book out titled &quot;Bad Republican,&quot; in which she cites <a href="/2021/07/meghan-mccain-see-ya-im-quitting-the-view/">her departure from The View</a> and labels the work environment on that long-running program as &quot;toxic.&quot;</p>
<p>In promotion of the memoir, John McCain&#8217;s daughter appeared Wednesday on Bravo&#8217;s Watch What Happens Live &#8212; and she had a lot to say.</p>
<p>About a lot of subjects.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with <strong>Erika Jayne</strong>, who stars on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hiills and who has been accused of teaming up with her estranged husband <a href="/2021/08/erika-jayne-will-she-have-to-pay-victims-of-toms-alleged-embezzl/">to embezzle millions of dollars</a> from his past law firm clients.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel bad for her,&quot; McCain told Andy Cohen. &quot;I know wealthy women who don&#8217;t know anything about their finances.&quot;</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s reunion special, <a href="/2021/10/erika-jayne-my-ex-husband-is-a-horny-nut-job-who-effed-me-over/">Jayne insisted that she gave her own paycheck</a> over to Tom Girardi and emphasized that she knew nothing about his business dealings.</p>
<p>What about the timing of Erika&#8217;s divorce filing, which took place mere weeks before Tom was charged with a number of crimes?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;The timelines match up to me,&quot; McCain said, adding that she spent a lot of time over the past year or so with Jayne. &quot;I believe her.&quot;</p>
<p>Girardi has been accused of stealing money from the surviving families of a plane crash in 2018 that killed 189 passengers and crew members, none of whom apparently received the settlement money coordinated through Tom&#8217;s law firm.</p>
<p>Jayne hasn&#8217;t sounded very sympathetic to the flight of these victims.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe she has a good heart. I believe that she will be proven innocent,&quot; Meghan continued, agreeingg that some of Erika&#8217;s social media posts came across poorly.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know what her lawyers are telling her because maybe they&rsquo;re telling her not to, but yeah, I would have toned down some of it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Moving on to <strong>Donald Trump and his family</strong>, McCain trashed&nbsp;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for showing up to her dad&#8217;s funeral.</p>
<p>She said they did so purely for PR reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;One of my dad&#8217;s old advisers told me that it was just an event that they wanted to go to because his funeral at the National Cathedral kind of ended up being this enormous moment,&quot; McCain said to Cohen.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told Lindsey Graham invited him. I&#8217;ve been told many different things from many different people.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Former President Trump, of course, once mocked Meghan&#8217;s father for being a prisoner of war in Vietnam, while insulting the ex-Arizona Senator every opportunity he got.</p>
<p>Hence McCain&#8217;s understandable anger at anyone close to him.</p>
<p>&quot;They should never have come,&quot; she added of Ivanka and Jared attending the funeral.</p>
<p>&quot;They had no business being there. I remember seeing them and seeing her specifically. They had no g&#8212;&#8212; business being there!&quot;</p>

<p>What about <strong>The View</strong> itself and her time on the series?</p>
<p>&quot;I adore Whoopi, she&rsquo;s an American icon, I have more love for her than anything else,&quot; McCain said up front when asked about her former colleagues.</p>
<p>But it sounds like McCain has no positive memories of anyone else on that set, especially not Joy Behar, with whom she openly clashed on numerous occasions.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Do you take any responsibility at all for the toxicity on The View?&quot; Cohen asked McCain on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Replied Meghan:</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, you know, that&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>&quot;I think only one person was bullied out of their job and doesn&rsquo;t work there anymore and I think that really says it all.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Meghan McCain is outta there, folks.</p>
<p>Or, to be more specific and accurate,&nbsp;Meghan McCain is <em>about</em> to be outta there, folks.</p>
<p>On Thursday&#8217;s brand new episode of The View, the polarizing talk show host announced that she&#8217;s leaving the ABC program after four years of pissing basically everyone around her off.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m here to tell all of you my wonderful co-hosts and the viewers at home that this will be my last season on The View,&quot; McCain said to open the installment.</p>
<p>The former Fox News correspondent, who joined The View in 2017, will finish out this season and will still be with the co-hosts until the end of July.</p>
<p>&quot;This was not an easy decision,&quot; McCain said, noting she&#8217;ll be living in Washington, D.C., from where she&#8217;s been filming amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&quot;It took a lot of thought and counsel and prayer and talking to my family and my close friends.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain, the daughter of late Senator John McCain, welcomed her first child in September.</p>
<p>She announced her departure alongside fellow panelists Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Sara Haines&#8230; almost all of whom she&#8217;s clashed with over the years as one of the show&#8217;s only conservative voices.</p>
<p>During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2019, the 36-year old addressed her typically-combative stance on the show, admitting back then to feeling insecure on air.</p>
<p>She figured she&#8217;d get axed on a constant basis.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I go in assuming I&#8217;m going to be fired every day,&quot; McCain said at the time. &quot;Every single day. Yes, every day.&quot;</p>
<p>Not long after saying this to Cohen, reports surfaced that <a href="/2019/07/meghan-mccain-get-me-the-eff-off-the-view/">McCain wanted off The View</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting to the point where it&rsquo;s not worth the emotional toll every week,&rdquo; reported The Daily Beast in July 2019, quoting a supposed friend of the star&#8217;s and citing her never-ending beefs with colleagues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t stay at The View, she will find other work.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="856" height="880" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic.png" alt="Meghan McCain View Pic" class="wp-image-332521" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic.png 856w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-292x300.png 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-768x790.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-735x756.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-326x335.png 326w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-338x347.png 338w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-506x520.png 506w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-623x640.png 623w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/meghan-mccain-view-pic-747x768.png 747w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear at this point just what that other work will entail for McCain.</p>
<p>Since returning from maternity leave in January, Meghan has gone at it almost as much as ever with her other hosts.</p>
<p>During one memorable on-air exchange, Joy Behar told McCain she &quot;did not miss&quot; her while she was away.</p>
<p>Days later, Meghan appeared on Watch What Happens Live to discuss the tension.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="847" height="777" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks.png" alt="Meghan McCain Speaks" class="wp-image-317580" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks.png 847w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-300x275.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-768x705.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-735x674.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-335x307.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-347x318.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-520x477.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/meghan-mccain-speaks-640x587.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>So it&#8217;s been such a rough reentry back into The View,&quot; she said to Cohen.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a really hard time getting back to work &#8212; I thought I would be back to work by the election&#8230;It&#8217;s just been a lot&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I will say I missed everyone, even if some people didn&#8217;t miss me.</p>
<p>&quot;I miss the show. We&#8217;re a family. All these women were at my dad&#8217;s funeral.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;ve been through a lot of s&#8211;t together, and I miss being on the show, and I hope that we can all be examples &#8212; myself included &#8212; for where the country should go forward.&quot;</p>

<p>On Thursday, McCain referenced her daughter and said she wants to remain in D.C. She wants to raise her daughter in the nation&#8217;s capitol.</p>
<p>She went on to praise her co-hosts, calling them &quot;strong, brilliant, intelligent broadcasters&quot; and &quot;the most talented women in all of television.&quot;</p>
<p>She said the job itself was one of &quot;greatest, most wonderful privileges of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>After noting her father pushed her to join the series despite her initial hesitations, Whoopi Goldberg responded with kindness:</p>
<p>&quot;It has been quite wonderful to sit across from you, your dad was very smart.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sara Haines also said it&#8217;s been an &quot;honor&quot; to work with McCain, who she went on to call &quot;tough,&quot; while&nbsp;Behar pointed out their &quot;disagreements&quot; and &quot;fights&quot; over the years.</p>
<p>However, she also brought up their &quot;drinking moments&quot; that were &quot;fun and interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Added Behar:</p>
<p>&quot;You and I have in common, as do all of us here, we&#8217;re on a show where we stick our necks out, we take the blowback, we take a lot of hits on this show and we stick by our points of view and you have done that brilliantly for four years.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you can say that I did the same thing.</p>
<p>&quot;I really appreciated that you were a formidable opponent in many ways and that you&#8217;ve spoke your mind and you&#8217;re no snowflake, missy.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In her closing statement, McCain said:</p>
<p>&quot;The media needs to do a better job of covering the women on this show in general.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As Joy pointed out, it&#8217;s not a fair fight. We&#8217;re covered with deep misogyny and sexism by the media.</p>
<p>&quot;If 5 men were doing what we do every day, I believe we would have a Pulitzer Prize at this point and it&#8217;s always reduced to really reductive coverage.&quot;</p>
