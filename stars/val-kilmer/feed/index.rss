<p>Sad news out of Hollywood this week:</p>



<p>Val Kilmer, a veteran actor best known for roles in 1986&#8217;s Top Gun in 1995&#8217;s Batman Forever &#8212; passed away on April 1.</p>



<p>He was 65 years old. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-at-6.59.06%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-522605"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Val Kilmer has died at the age of 65. RIP.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The star&#8217;s daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, spoke to the New York Times and said her father died due to pneumonia.</p>



<p>Val Kilmer made his final appearance on film in 2022&#8217;s Top Gun: Maverick, a sequel to the aforementioned classic. </p>



<p>The actor reprised his role from the original movie in this hit project, sharing an emotional scene with Tom Cruise.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just want to say that was pretty emotional,&#8221; Cruise told Jimmy Kimmel back then about acting alongside his friend again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Val for decades, and for him to come back and play that character… he&#8217;s such a powerful actor that he instantly became that character again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014.</p>



<p>According to a December 2017 article in The Hollywood Reporter, the actor’s two-year fight with this disease had “taken its toll” on the family.</p>



<p>This piece noted that Kilmer had undergone a procedure on his trachea which made his voice raspy and left him short of breath.</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t make many public appearances, or take on many jobs, in his latter years as a result.</p>

<p>“I have not had a tumor, or a tumor operations, or any operation I had a complication where the best way to receive care was to stay under the watchful eye of the UCLA ICU,” Kilmer said in a Facebook post after he was spotted in 2015 with a tracheostomy tube. </p>



<p>“I am praying for a speedy return to the boards as they say. God bless you all and please don’t worry.”</p>



<p>Over the course of his career, Kilmer appeared in numerous legendary films&#8230; including 1988&#8217;s Willow, 1991&#8217;s The Doors, 1993&#8217;s True Romance, 1995&#8217;s Heat and 2005&#8217;s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.</p>

<p>Outside of acting, Kilmer had a passion for visual arts, working with both photography and paint.</p>



<p>&#8220;See ya, pal. I&#8217;m going to miss you. You were a smart, challenging, brave, uber-creative firecracker,&#8221; Josh Brolin wrote on social media after news of Kilmer&#8217;s passing went viral.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a lot left of those. I hope to see you up there in the heavens when I eventually get there. Until then, amazing memories, lovely thoughts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Added Josh Gad via Instagram: <em>RIP Val Kilmer. Thank you for defining so many of the movies of my childhood. You truly were an icon</em>.</p>



<p>Val Kilmer is survived by friends and family, including his two children with ex-wife Joanne Whalley: Mercedes and Jack Kilmer.</p>



<p>May he rest in peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Back in February of 2015, several media outlets reported that <a href="/2015/02/val-kilmer-dying-due-to-bizarre-religious-beliefs/">Val Kilmer was on his deathbed</a>.</p>
<p>The actor was reportedly suffering from throat cancer, and several insiders insisted  that his condition had been exacerbated by his Christian Scientist beliefs, which prevented him from undergoing necessary medical procedures.</p>
<p>Clearly, either Kilmer&#8217;s condition was exaggerated or he made a miraculous recovery, because two years later, the beloved screen icon is still standing &#8211; but some continue to maintain that he&#8217;s on his last legs.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kilmer appeared at an event in Los Angeles last week to promote his one-man show Citizen Twain, which has reportedly been put on indefinite hiatus due to the actor&#8217;s health issues.</p>
<p><a href="/2016/11/val-kilmer-cancer-rumors-resurface-after-actor-cancels-tour/">Kilmer canceled a tour</a> of the show back in November and has yet to reschedule.</p>
<p>The event on February 9 marked his first public appearance in several weeks.</p>
<p>Sadly, those in attendance say the actor appeared pale and gaunt, and was unable to stand while addressing the audience (as prior speakers had) and seemed to run out of breath while speaking.</p>
<p>“He performs as the ghost of Mark Twain in the show, but even as a dead man he looked ten times better than he does now,” one attendee told Radar Online.</p>

<p>The witness added:</p>
<p>“The difference between Val three years ago and him on stage now is both shocking and heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>“He could barely stand, he had to sit down to talk,” said another audience member.</p>
<p>“He was gasping for breath and he’s lost about half his body weight. His face has such deep lines on it and he appears so fragile. It is so sad to see such a huge talent so humbled.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kilmer&#8217;s sallow appearance and long disappearances from the spotlight have led to numerous rumors about his declining health.</p>
<p>Back in November, the actor&#8217;s longtime friend <a href="/2016/11/val-kilmer-i-dont-have-cancer-michael-douglas-is-full-of-s-t/">Michael Douglas confirmed that Kilmer has cancer</a>.</p>
<p>Kilmer issued a statement saying that he is fond of Douglas, but that Douglas is telling tales out of school:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever led Michael Douglas to speculate about my health, he&#8217;s a loving and devoted friend to a privileged group of talented people,&#8221; Kilmer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he meant no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elegiac tone of Citizen Twain has led some fans to speculate that it&#8217;s meant to serve as Kilmer&#8217;s swan song:</p>
<p>“The first half of the show is very funny, but the second half is a lot more reflective,&#8221; says one audience member.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s very philosophical in places and deals with some big questions.”</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to Kilmer and his family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>For several months now, rumors that actor <a href="/2016/06/val-kilmer-reemerges-looking-gaunt-after-life-saving-surgery/">Val Kilmer&nbsp;is suffering from throat cancer</a> have been circulating on social media.</p>
<p>Kilmer has repeatedly refuted those reports, but sadly, there&#8217;s growing cause for concern with regard to the actor&#8217;s health.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In addition to his status as a bonafide screen icon, Kilmer has won the respect of fans on the strength of his one-man show, which consists of a monologue performed in the character of American literary legend Mark Twain.</p>
<p>After a year of sold-out shows in Los Angeles, Kilmer had planned to take the show on the road this month, but he was forced to cancel at the last minute due to unspecified health problems.</p>
<p>TMZ has obtained footage of <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/11/11/val-kilmer-swollen-tongue-cancer-rumors-citizen-twain/">Kilmer&nbsp;having difficulty speaking</a>&nbsp;while addressing a crowd in LA and informing them that he would not be able to perform due to his breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>The video is upsetting, but Kilmer maintains that he&#8217;s merely suffering from oral health issues that have resulted in a swollen tongue.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kilmer disappeared from the public eye for several months last year.</p>
<p>When he re-emerged he was only photographed wearing scarves that covered his neck, which led to reports&nbsp;that <a href="/2015/12/val-kilmer-fitted-with-tracheostomy-tube-actor-reportedly-loses/">Kilmer had undergone life-saving surgery</a>.</p>
<p>Rumors about the actor&#8217;s illness&nbsp;first resurfaced when cancer survivor <a href="/2016/11/val-kilmer-i-dont-have-cancer-michael-douglas-is-full-of-s-t/">Michael Douglas spoke about Kilmer&#8217;s&nbsp;health</a> in an interview last week:</p>
<p>&quot;Val was a wonderful guy who is dealing with exactly what I had [tongue cancer],&quot; Douglas told journalist Jonathan Ross.</p>
<p>&quot;My prayers are with him.&quot;</p>

<p>Douglas added:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s why you haven&#8217;t heard too much from Val lately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love Michael Douglas but he is misinformed,&quot; Kilmer wrote on Facebook in response to Douglas&#8217; statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The last time I spoke to him was almost two years ago, when I asked him for a referral for a specialist to get a diagnosis for a lump in my throat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;[That] prevented me from continuing a tour of my play CITIZEN TWAIN. I ended up using a team at UCLA and have no cancer whatsoever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I still have a swollen tongue and am rehabbing steadily.&quot;</p>

<p>Kilmer continued:</p>
<p>&quot;Some fans have mistakenly thought my silence about my personal issues meant that somehow I wasn&#8217;t being responsible to my health.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of my reliance on prayer and Love. Nothing could be further from the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/val-kilmer-not-me-im-in-my-prime"></a></figure></div>
<p>We joke only because we believe Val when he says he has his health concerns are minor and manageable.</p>
<p>Whatever the issue, our thoughts are with Kilmer and his family, and we hope he receives whatever treatment he might need going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>After Michael Douglas revealed (erroneously) that Val Kilmer has cancer, the latter opened up about his health in a rare public statement.</p>
<p>What did Kilmer have to say on Facebook?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Douglas implied Kilmer was battling throat cancer, as he Michael had, fueling suspicion that <a href="http://ttp://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/10/val-kilmer-hospitalized-reportedly-near-death/">Val is hospitalized and near death</a>.</p>
<p>According to Val, Michael is well-meaning.</p>
<p>But he is also incorrect in his comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Michael Douglas but he is misinformed,&#8221; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/valkilmer/posts/1316475381717500">Kilmer wrote on Facebook</a>, refuting Douglas&#8217; claims that he suffers from the disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time I spoke to him was almost two years ago, when I asked him for a referral for a specialist to get a diagnosis for a lump in my throat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[That] prevented me from continuing a tour of my play CITIZEN TWAIN. I ended up using a team at UCLA and have no cancer whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still have a swollen tongue and am rehabbing steadily.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-1024x683.jpg" alt="Michael Douglas Smiles" class="wp-image-235195" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/michael-douglas-smiles-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Douglas surprisingly shared his belief that Kilmer was suffering from cancer during a Q&amp;A with Jonathan Ross in London on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Val was a wonderful guy who is dealing with exactly what I had [tongue cancer],&#8221; he revealed. &#8220;My prayers are with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you haven&#8217;t heard too much from Val lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Douglas, things didn&#8217;t &#8220;look too good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kilmer continued his clarification on social media:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some fans have mistakenly thought my silence about my personal issues meant that somehow I wasn&#8217;t being responsible to my health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of my reliance on prayer and Love,&#8221; Kilmer, a practicing Christian Scientist, continued, people get the wrong idea about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could be further from the truth,&#8221; he insists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Altho I am very grateful for all the support from around the world, when people found out I had a physical challenge,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this puts to rest any further concerns about my health by publications that have no respect for the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds that there are no hard feelings, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever led Michael Douglas to speculate about my health, he&#8217;s a loving and devoted friend to a privileged group of talented people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he meant no harm,&#8221; Kilmer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being healthy and having the respect of my peers and love from my family, friends, peers and fans is a DAILY source of inspiration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so grateful, you have no idea. I work VERY hard at my craft, and being appreciated since I was a little boy for being able to give this gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has literally made my life. Thank you all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve only just begun, now that I&#8217;m finally telling stories that I&#8217;ve written and produced the way my vision intends them. God bless you all.”</p>

<p>As recently as last winter, Kilmer had been wearing tracheotomy tube, sparking speculation that he had been struggling with his health.</p>
<p>The scarves he was wearing seemed to be more than a fashion statement, but he seems to be putting the rumors to rest &#8230; for now.</p>

<p>Sources say Kilmer, a devout Christian Scientist, was working with an expert who promised to help him &quot;talk and meditate&quot; his way back to health.</p>
<p>After several months of concealing his neck with a&nbsp;handkerchief&nbsp;(as in the photograph above) Kilmer eventually disappeared from the public eye altogether.</p>
<p>He was <a href="/2015/12/val-kilmer-fitted-with-tracheostomy-tube-actor-reportedly-loses/">fitted with a tracheostomy</a> tube in December, and several insiders say it cost the 56-year-old the ability to speak.</p>
<p>Reps for Kilmer&nbsp;have offered very little with regard to news of his health, but they <em>have</em> dispelled the rumor that he can no longer talk.</p>
<p>Sources claim that in&nbsp;January, <a href="/2016/01/val-kilmer-undergoes-life-saving-cancer-surgery/">Kilmer underwent a life-saving surgery</a>, and while his reps neither confirmed not denied that an emergency procedure took place, the actor was not seen in public&nbsp;for several months afterward.</p>
<p>In fact, it was just yesterday that Kilmer was photographed by paparazzi for the first time in nearly six months.</p>
<p>The surgery reportedly removed a several tumors that had spread to Kilmer&#8217;s lymph nodes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://radaronline.com/photos/val-kilmer-cancer-throat-tumor-scandal-photos-thin-gaunt-top-gun-star-vacation-hawaii/photo/1303467/?utm_source=MediaVine&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TrafficExchange_June">latest photos of Val</a> show him walking under his own power without any visible scarring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, many fans have noted that Kilmer seems to have lost a frightening amount of weight.</p>
<p>Kilmer, who was sadly chided for his weight <em>gain</em> in the months before news of his health troubles went public, now appears astonishingly&nbsp;gaunt.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if the actor&#8217;s weight loss is related to his cancer treatment, but the newest photos of Val have done little to allay fans&#8217; concerns about his health.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it seems that Val has received or is currently receiving treatment for his health.</p>
<p>We wish him all the best and hope to see the man who wowed with countless memorable performances return to the big screen in the very near future.&nbsp;</p>
