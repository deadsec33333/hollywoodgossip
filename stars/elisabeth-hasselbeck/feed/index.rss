										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years before Meghan McCain was whining at Whoopi Goldberg, Elisabeth Hasselbeck was hosting&nbsp;<em>The View</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="/videos/elisabeth-hasselbeck-i-prayed-when-i-learned-rosie-odonnell-had/">a touch more homophobia</a>.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Hasselbeck went on a tirade about Plan B, and Barbara Walters asked her to moderate her tone and be respectful.</p>
<p>Hasselbeck stormed off of the set, and we now have the F-bomb filled audio of what Hasselbeck screeched backstage.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In August of 2006, Elisabeth Hasselbeck went on a fiery rant about the morning after pill.</p>
<p>The morning after pill prevents fertilization, just like wearing a condom or just staying in and binging something on Netflix.</p>
<p>But Hasselbeck&#8217;s concern was that it was &quot;a slippery slope to just eliminating life.&quot;</p>
<p>She then launched into a tangent, growing increasingly heated, suggesting people who support universal healthcare but also reproductive autonomy are hypocrites.</p>
<p>Barbara Walters still appeared on the show she started at the time, and she urged Hasselbeck to calm down and speak in a civil tone.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<em>The View</em>&nbsp;cuts to commercial, Hasselbeck dramatically rips up her notecards and storms off of the stage in a huff.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That&#8217;s not the end of it, though, because&nbsp;<em>Variety</em>&nbsp;has unearthed the audio recording from Hasselbeck&#8217;s backstage hissy fit.</p>
<p>In the audio, Hasselbeck can be heard continuing to freak out, while Joy Behar tries to comfort her.</p>
<p>&quot;F&#8211;k that! I&#8217;m not going to sit there and get reprimanded on the air,&quot; Hasselbeck declares repeatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not okay to sit there and get reprimanded on the air,&quot; she insists. &quot;What the f&#8211;k!&quot;</p>
<p>She then suggests that Barbara&#8217;s words impacted her so much that she&#8217;s no longer responsible for her own behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t even swear,&quot; she claims. &quot;She has me swearing.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;This woman is driving me nuts,&quot; Hasselbeck declares. &quot;I&#8217;m not going back. I can&#8217;t do the show like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She just reprimanded me,&quot; she claims again. &quot;And she knew exactly what she was doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodbye!&quot; Hasselbeck says dramatically. &quot;I&#8217;m off.&quot;</p>
<p>Hilariously, she ends her rant with: &quot;Read about that in the New York f&#8211;king Post!&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck would, in fact, remain on&nbsp;<em>The View</em>&nbsp;for another seven years.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That bizarre rant was wild, but Hasselbeck has now posted an apology on Instagram, and it is filled with gems.</p>
<p>&quot;This. Just. In: I am quite humanly reactive,&quot; Hasselbeck writes.</p>
<p><em>Humanly reactive</em>&nbsp;is quite a phrase.</p>
<p>She admits: &quot;I used bad words when frustrated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was pregnant with Taylor,&quot; she explains. &quot;And a big conversation about the value and the lives of the unborn took place at the View.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a battle,&quot; she writes. &quot;But not of the flesh.&quot;</p>
<p><em>A battle not of the flesh</em>? You cannot make this stuff up.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I used fighting words,&quot; Hasselbeck explains. &quot;Because I believe that God decides the value of the lives of babies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We care for a group of Robin&rsquo;s eggs in a nest before they are hatched,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she adds. &quot;Likely would think twice before stomping on the awesome blue shells because we know what God placed inside the hard womb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And in the heat of the moment, when I felt the need to protect what I knew to be truth,&quot; she writes.</p>
<p>&quot;And had seen with my own eyes on ultrasound the LIFE in my own shell of a body,&quot; she continues. &quot;I used big battle words.&quot;</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;<em>big battle words</em>&nbsp;is my new favorite euphemism for swearing.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>She notes: &quot;(one in particular that I am not proud of and am sorry for using in the heat of trying to defend the lives of the unborn).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;2 things I have grown to learn: 1) there are words that DISTRACT from your point: Choose wisely,&quot; Hasselbeck advises.</p>
<p>She adds: &quot;2) I have a God who fights the battle. I don&rsquo;t have to do that all on my own.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck then goes on to use this controversy to plug her book, of course.</p>
<p>&quot;I still hold all my Constitutionally protected rights to freedom of faith,&quot; she then writes.</p>
<p>&quot;But now,&quot; Hasselbeck concludes. &quot;I can hold the hand of the person who does not agree at the same time.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to get too personal here, but we can of course understand someone feeling extremely passionately about their beliefs.</p>
<p>Even if a person believes that life begins at the moment of conception, the morning after pill should not be an issue, as it <em>prevents</em> conception.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not called hte Next Week Pill or the At My Convenience Pill. Time is of the essence.</p>
<p>But even though no &quot;unborn human lives&quot; by any definition were involved, it&#8217;s clear that Hasselbeck for some reason believed that they were.</p>
<p>Barbara Walters very gently told her to please moderate her tone out of respect for both cohosts and the audience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that she freaked out in the way that she did, but the goofy phrases in her &quot;apology&quot; today make it all worthwhile.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Rosie O&#8217;Donnell confessed that she had a crush on Elisabeth Hasselbeck during their cohosting days on <em>The View</em>.</p>
<p>Hasselbeck went on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> and responded: &quot;I read it and I immediately started praying.&quot;</p>
<p>She said similar things in an appearance on <em>The View</em>, and is getting dragged for coming across as downright homophobic.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>First, here were Rosie O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s exact words in her book,&nbsp;<em>Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of the View</em>.</p>
<p>Reportedly, in order to quash rumors that she and Hasselbeck were enemies back in the day, Rosie &#8230; overcorrected.</p>
<p>She says that she &quot;loved&quot; her conservative cohost and admitted that she had &quot;a little bit of a crush&quot; on her.</p>
<p>Rosie then suggested that there were &quot;underlying lesbian tones on both [of their] parts&quot; while they were on&nbsp;<em>The View</em>.</p>
<p>She then made reference to Hasselbeck&#8217;s past as a softball player, implying Hasselbeck may not be entirely straight herself.</p>

<p>Hasselbeck appeared on both <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> and <em>The View</em> to respond to Rosie&#8217;s statements.</p>
<p>Sunny Hostin asked Hasselbeck about this as she assumed the role of guest host on&nbsp;<em>The View</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s the breath of the Holy Spirit,&quot; Hasselbeck responds. &quot;Like please, Holy Spirit, work through me right now, so I don&#8217;t answer my own mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This needs to be addressed both truthfully and &#8230; maybe where I wouldn&#8217;t have addressed it with grace some years past,&quot; Hasselbeck admits.</p>
<p>When you finish hearing her response, you wonder how much worse it would have been years ago.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;One,&quot; Hasselbeck says. &quot;I think what she said was reckless. Untrue.&quot;</p>
<p>That sounds fine, until she says: &quot;Not only insulting &#8212; disturbing.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck tries to spin it, saying: &quot;When it comes to &#8230; how she felt about somebody in the workplace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That somebody happened to be me,&quot; she says. &quot;But if you replace what Rosie said, and you take her name out, and you put in &#8230; &#8216;Robert.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we would be in a situation where you would see the objectification of a woman in the workplace,&quot; Hasselbeck claims.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;And that&#8217;s disturbing,&quot; Hasselbeck claims. &quot;Because when we may be really against that from a man to a woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#8217;t get a pass because you&#8217;re a lesbian,&quot; she suggests.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling was not mutual,&quot; Hasselbeck insists. &quot;But I did respect her as a cohost.&quot;</p>
<p>She adds: &quot;As I think it should happen in all workplaces.&quot;</p>
<p>She emphasizes that, in very religious terms, she forgives Rosie for her statements.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Secondly,&quot; Hasselbeck continues. &quot;I think what she says about female athletes &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#8217;re an athletic girl,&quot; she says. &quot;And you&#8217;re competitive and you&#8217;re gritty &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a lie and it&#8217;s reckless to attach a sexuality to that,&quot; Hasselbeck asserts.</p>
<p>&quot;And I think it&#8217;s selfish on her part,&quot; she accuses. &quot;And I would say it to my friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just because you&#8217;re athletic,&quot; Hasselbeck concludes. &quot;Doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with your sexual preference.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="680" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-680x1024.jpg" alt="Rosie O'Donnell is Snarky" class="wp-image-255911" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-768x1156.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-1361x2048.jpg 1361w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-735x1106.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-345x520.jpg 345w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-425x640.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-510x768.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-638x960.jpg 638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-717x1080.jpg 717w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/rosie-odonnell-is-snarky-scaled.jpg 1701w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Twitter)</figcaption></figure>

<p>One, having a crush on a coworker and admitting it many, many years later is not the same thing as objectification.</p>
<p>It should not in any way be equated with workplace sexual harassment.</p>
<p>If Rosie had made lewd anatomical comments about Hasselbeck, or made it an issue while they were on&nbsp;<em>The View</em>, that would be different.</p>
<p>But as Joy Behar correctly points out, Rosie&#8217;s comment about having a crush was not lewd or inappropriate.</p>
<p>Hasselbeck refers to an alleged reference to Rosie trying to &quot;take her under her wing.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Unless Hasselbeck is accusing Rosie of inappropriate behavior during their time on&nbsp;<em>The View</em>, then it doesn&#8217;t sound like anything inappropriate went down.</p>
<p>Second of all, Hasselbeck is wrong to equate a crush from a woman to a crush from a man.</p>
<p>Many lesbians are inundated with the idea that they are &quot;predatory&quot; by being attracted to women. That is massively unfair.</p>
<p>In contrast &#8212; and I&#8217;m a dude writing this &#8212; we all know that, historically, men with crushes are much more likely to make it a problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are non-homophobic ways of saying that you&#8217;re straight.</p>
<p>It would have been cool if Elisabeth Hasselbeck had found one of those instead of immediately resorting to prayer and stereotypes.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, Hasselbeck is absolutely right about one thing &#8212; and we don&#8217;t say that often.</p>
<p>Assuming that a person is gay because of their profession or hobby or degree of athleticism is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s misleading and, while not&nbsp;<em>insulting</em>, certainly unfair.</p>
<p>While softball is stereotypically associated with lesbians, stereotypes are inherently demeaning and dehumanizing.</p>
<p>Rosie should know better than to perpetuate that kind of talk.</p>

<p>Our favorite part of this whole dang interview was Meghan McCain telling Hasselbeck she&#8217;s &quot;been a fan of you my entire life.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck is only 7 years older than Meghan.</p>
<p>If you ever really want to hurt the feelings of someone young enough to be your sibling, tell them that you&#8217;ve been a fan of them &quot;your whole life.&quot;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t think that Meghan meant any offense by that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elisabeth Hasselbeck is going to need a few minutes, people.</p>
<p>Can you talk amongst yourself for a little while?</p>
<p>The 38-year old announced via statement on Monday that she&rsquo;s leaving her post as a Fox &amp; Friends panelist in December, saying at the time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oftentimes, the most difficult decisions are between two great things,&quot; said the former View co-host.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout my 14 years working in television, I have never experienced a more positive and thoughtful atmosphere than FOX News Channel.&quot;</p>
<p>The conservative&nbsp;television personality, who was also a castaway on Survivor back in the day, reiterated these points on air Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Like I said, I much preferred and am honored to have had the role of bringing you the news rather than being it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a ton of respect for you all here and you at home [and] I want to share with you what&#8217;s been on my heart.</p>
<p>&quot;I am&#8230; taking a new position as CBO, Chief Breakfast Officer, at our house with the kids and that does mean that in about a month, I will be leaving my Fox News family.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck said that the time between now and her final show will be a &quot;No Cry Zone,&quot; but she couldn&#8217;t stop the tears from flowing upon confirming this very sad news.</p>
<p>In reference to her co-hosts, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade, Hasselbeck shared:</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s hard because of all of you. You all have made this a really hard decision. I have fallen head over heels with this place.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck is the mother of three kids (Grace, 10, Taylor, 8, Isaiah, 6) and the husband of a former NFL quarterback.</p>
<p>Watch her announce her departure and break down into tears now:</p>

<p>The young actress slowly built her resume prior to becoming a key cast member on <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/pretty-little-liars/">Pretty Little Liars</a>.</p>
<p>But do you know the obscure reality show on which Hale appeared many years before becoming Aria Montgomery?</p>
<p>What about Heather Morris before she impressed us with her moves on Glee? Josh Henderson before he smoldered on Dallas?</p>

<p>Prepare to be shocked, television and movie fans!</p>
<p>The above photo gallery reveals the pasts of various big-time celebrities who weren&#8217;t always getting nominated for Oscars and Teen Choice Awards.</p>
<p>Most of them were just hoping to get noticed in any way possible by appearing on a reality TV series. Or trying to win a giant cash prize.</p>
<p>Few succeeded back in the day, but fast forward all these years later and they can laugh about these seemingly random past experiences. Laugh all the way to the bank, that is!</p>

<p>Just one day after word got out that <a href="/2014/07/rosie-odonnell-to-run-it-back-on-the-view/">Rosie O&#8217;Donnell would return to The View</a> as a co-host of the popular chat show, Elisabeth Hasselbeck responded as only she can.</p>
<p><a href="/2014/07/elisabeth-hasselbeck-blasts-rosie-odonnell-on-fox-news/">Hasselbeck blasted O&#8217;Donnell</a> on Fox News, accusing the comedienne of equating US troops with terrorists. (Hasselbeck apparently didn&#8217;t get the memo that Rosie&#8217;s son attends military school):</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/elisabeth-hasselbeck-talks-rosie-odonnell"></a></figure>
<p>Former View co-host <a href="/2014/07/joy-behar-to-elisabeth-hasselbeck-explain-yourself/">Joy Behar demanded an explanation from Hasselbeck</a> and today she got one. Kind of&#8230;</p>
<p>Behar took to Instagram to elaborate on her &quot;analysis&quot; of the O&#8217;Donnell situation and explain why she&#8217;ll never retract her statements:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>&quot;When asked about Roise&nbsp;combing [sic] back, I provided my analysis,&quot; wrote Hasselbeck. &quot;When the two chairs get filled &#8211; if asked &#8211; I will provide my analysis.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck then posted a transcript of a debate between herself and O&#8217;Donnell that aired on The View in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t hate Rosie,&quot; Hasselbeck continued. &quot;I actually called to have a conversation with her seven years ago. She did not want to speak to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to have a #momversation about why I would never defend her 2007 comments.&quot;</p>
<p>Momversation? Wow. We hate to take sides here, but we really can&#8217;t get on board with Elisabeth&#8217;s use of terrible puns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s Deju&nbsp;Vu all over again for&nbsp;Joy Behar.</p>
<p>For many months during her stint as co-host of The View, Behar was stuck between a feuding Rosie O&#8217;Donnell and&nbsp;Elisabeth Hasselbeck &#8211; and now that&nbsp;<a href="/2014/07/rosie-odonnell-to-run-it-back-on-the-view/">O&#8217;Donnell is on her way back</a>,&nbsp;Behar finds herself once again being asked about the two rivals.</p>
<p>In light&#8217;s of Rosie&#8217;s likely re-hiring,&nbsp;<a href="/2014/07/elisabeth-hasselbeck-blasts-rosie-odonnell-on-fox-news/">Hasselbeck BLASTED the comedian</a> this week, actually saying O&#8217;Donnell has &quot;spit in the face of our military.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to CNN last night, Behar referring to this as a &ldquo;a hate-filled remark,&rdquo; one that hit &ldquo;below the belt&rdquo; and offered a simple question for&nbsp;Hasselbeck:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;d like Elisabeth to explain herself,&quot; Behar&nbsp;said. &quot;What does she mean by that?&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/joy-behar-calls-out-elisabeth-hasselbeck"></a></figure>
<p>&quot;Isn&#8217;t it kind of a nasty thing to say about somebody who basically is a good person?&quot; Behar continued. &quot;I mean, say what you want about Rosie O&#8217;Donnell, she&#8217;s a very generous person, she has a million kids, she&#8217;s always rescuing children.&quot;</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Behar added that one of Rosie&#8217;s kids attends The Citadel, so &quot;what more does Elisabeth want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To say that she spits in the face of the military, that&#8217;s a dangerous thing to say about somebody,&quot; Behar said. &quot;First of all, it&#8217;s not true. I would like her to prove it.&quot;</p>
<p>Then again, Joy concluded, &quot;everything is fiction on Fox anyway, what am I talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>With Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy on their way out, possible View replacements are filling the rumor mill these days.</p>
<p>The latest name under considering, according to sources? <a href="/stars/meghan-mccain/">Meghan McCain</a>. We like it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The <a href="/2007/05/behind-the-scenes-of-the-rosie-odonnell-elisabeth-hasselbeck-smackdown/">Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Rosie O&#8217;Donnell feud</a> dates back to 2006 when the two co-host&#8217;s opposing political beliefs made for some entertaining daily head-butting on The View.</p>
<p>Hasselbeck and O&#8217;Donnell haven&#8217;t sat on the panel together since 2008, but Hasselbeck has apparently spent the years since fuming about O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the arch-conservative&nbsp;Hasselbeck&nbsp;spews her views on Fox News these days and even though she&#8217;s on vacation from her gig as a co-host on Fox &amp; Friends, the former Survivor competitor called into Fox today to share her thoughts on the reports that <a href="/2014/07/rosie-odonnell-to-run-it-back-on-the-view/">O&#8217;Donnell may be returning to The View</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/elisabeth-hasselbeck-talks-rosie-odonnell"></a></figure>
<p>As you may have guessed, Elisabeth is less than thrilled to find out that her rival will be returning to daytime TV:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>&quot;What could ruin a vacation more than to hear news like this?&quot; Hasselbeck asked her new co-hosts. &quot;Talk about not securing the border! Here in comes to The View the woman who spit in the face of our military, spit in the face of her own network, and really in the face of a woman who stood by her and had civilized debates for the time she was there.&quot;</p>
<p>Presumably, Hasselbeck is referring to herself when she says &quot;the woman who stood by her&quot; and to the ugly, vicious exchanges between herself and O&#8217;Donnell when she talks about &quot;civilized debates.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck added that she believes ABC conspired to have O&#8217;Donnell return to the show after Hasselbeck&#8217;s departure, stating, &quot;I think this has been in the works for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>The View has two vacancies to fill for its upcoming eighteenth season, as <a href="/2014/06/sherri-shepherd-and-jenny-mccarthy-let-go-from-the-view/">Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd were let go</a> from the show last month.&nbsp;</p>
