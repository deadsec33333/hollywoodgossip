<p>Kris Jenner is talking wedding plans with Corey Gamble. But she&#8217;s not rushing.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most serious topic on Season 5 of <em>The Kardashians</em> has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kris-jenner-tumor-the-kardashians-trailer-season-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kris Jenner&#8217;s medical crisis</a>.</p>



<p>Doctors found what appeared to be a tumor. The beloved momager had to undergo surgery to remove the growth &#8212; and prevent more from following.</p>



<p>This very serious topic branched out into discussing a possible wedding to Corey Gamble. But will she actually remarry?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kris-jenner-underwent-surgery">Kris Jenner underwent surgery </h2>



<p>On <em>The Kardashians </em>Season 5, Kris Jenner learned through her doctors that she had an alarming growth.</p>



<p>At first, she was preparing for the removal of her ovaries. That was already hard. Then, she learned that it would be better if she underwent a full hysterectomy.</p>



<p>Losing her uterus hit her hard. Kris has six children. She has spoken about how much she loved being pregnant. And while pregnancy would be a non-starter regardless, there&#8217;s an emotional component to this. (Plus, it&#8217;s a more significant surgery)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-1024x576.png" alt="Corey Gamble and Kris Jenner on Season 5, Episode 8 of The Kardashians." class="wp-image-503649" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_03_coreygamble_krisjenner.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Corey Gamble suggests that everyone can eat &#8220;plaplapla in peace&#8221; after Kris Jenner and two of her daughters discuss the practice of placenta consumption.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As Kris gathers a few members of her family to eat cake to say farewell to her internal reproductive organs, we learn two things.</p>



<p>The first is that Kris misunderstood a fact about egg development, suggesting that she <em>made </em>True Thompson when she gave birth to Khloe. That is a goofy mom-ism if we&#8217;ve ever heard one.</p>



<p>The second is that, according to Khloe, Kourtney &#8220;eats placenta all the time.&#8221; Kourt has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-present-first-baby-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given birth to four kids</a>, so either Khloe was exaggerating or Kourtney&#8217;s sourcing placenta from other places. That sentence will haunt us for life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kris-jenner-has-a-serious-talk-with-friends">Kris Jenner has a serious talk with friends</h2>



<p>Heading out to shop, Kris Jenner meets up with two infamous friends: Faye Resnick and Kathy Hilton.</p>



<p>Kathy is arguably best known as being Paris Hilton&#8217;s mother, second best known as being Kyle Richards&#8217; sister. Relatedly, she was also something of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kathy-hilton-denies-using-homophobic-slur-erika-jayne-is-slandering-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent villain on <em>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</em></a>.</p>



<p>Faye has also appeared on <em>RHOBH</em>. However, she is and forever will be best known for her role in the OJ Simpson trial.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-1024x576.png" alt="Faye Resnick and Kathy Hilton on The Kardashians." class="wp-image-503651" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_07_kathyhilton_fayeresnick.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick sit on the stairs at an upscale establishment on The Kardashians Season 5.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kris opened up to her longtime friends about her upcoming surgery. They were very supportive.</p>



<p>(Notably, she had this conversation in the early evening the day before her 6AM surgery. We really hope that her drink was not what it appeared to be)</p>



<p>However, Kathy revealed that Kris&#8217; news had taken her by surprise. She&#8217;d expected something very different.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kris-jenner-making-wedding-plans">Is Kris Jenner making wedding plans?</h2>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0">“I thought you were gonna tell me you’re getting married,” Kathy confessed. Kris has been dating Corey Gamble for nearly a decade, as the two first connected in the summer of 2014.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">“I mean, not right this very second,” Kris replied.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">“I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow],&#8221; Kathy then joked. &#8220;I’m like, ‘That’s a little early for me to be. …&#8217;”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-1024x576.png" alt="Kris Jenner laughs on The Kardashians Season 5." class="wp-image-503654" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0711_thekardashians_09_krisjenner.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On The Kardashians, Kris Jenner laughs with delight over the idea of remarrying.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0">Kris concluded for her: “Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid. I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I’m 70!”</p>



<p>At present, Kris Jenner is 68. She will turn 69 (nice) years old on November 5, 2024.</p>



<p>Just for the record, 2024 would be a very sensible time to begin planning a wedding that could take place some time in late 2025 or in 2026. That Kris is not suggests that she&#8217;s not necessarily taking this wedding idea very seriously. One has to wonder how Corey feels about that.</p>

<p>Is there a new Kris Jenner marriage on the horizon?</p>



<p>Decades ago, the way that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/kris-jenner-cheating-on-robert-was-my-lifes-biggest-regret/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things ended for Kris and Robert Kardashian</a> could have been better. Her marriage to Caitlyn Jenner ended nearly a decade ago.</p>



<p>Kris has not remarried. Meanwhile, her daughter, Kim, who is newly divorced, remains unmarried. And Kendall, the lone childfree adult of the family, has <em>never</em> married.</p>



<p>Is any of that going to change in the near future?</p>

<p>Not when the current situation is working.</p>



<p>“All of us are having fun,” Kris characterized. </p>

<p>In 2018, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kuwtk-kris-jenner/id1537463766?i=1000496153813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kris Jenner spoke to Laura Wasser</a> on the celebrity divorce attorney&#8217;s then-new <em>Divorce Sucks!</em> podcast.</p>



<p>“You know you never say never, but I often say it’s just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,” she remarked at the time.</p>



<p>Kris married Robert Sr. in 1978, only divorcing in 1991 after welcoming four children. Kris married Caitlyn Jenner in 1991, decades before the latter&#8217;s transition, before the two formally divorced in 2015.</p>

<p>Kendall is currently 28. For an American Millennial, this is a very normal age at which to have never married and to remain childfree.</p>



<p>Reportedly, she is currently dating athlete Devin Booker. Previously, the two dated from 2020 until 2022.</p>



<p>In 2023, Kendall was dating Bad Bunny, but the two sent their separate ways in December of that year.</p>

<p>These days, rumors have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/kim-kardashian-and-tom-brady-get-flirty-in-the-most-expensive-way-imaginable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connected Kim Kardashian to a number of famous men</a>. </p>



<p>The most recent is Odell Bekham Jr. Reports had them spending time together as far back as September 2023. </p>



<p>More recently, in February 2024, the two attended a pre-Super Bowl party. That&#8217;s not quite confirmation that there&#8217;s an entanglement, but Kim&#8217;s fans are eager to connect those dots.</p>

<p>However, in the wake of Kim&#8217;s painful divorce from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/kim-kardashian-breaks-down-over-kanye-cries-he-didnt-always-hate-jews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notorious antisemite Kanye West</a>, fans can understand why she&#8217;s not in any rush to remarry.</p>



<p>Kim needs someone who understands her, who understands her lifestyle, and who won&#8217;t run unhinged vanity political campaigns that involve unmedicated on-stage meltdowns or outspoken bigotry.</p>



<p>Also, as Kris Jenner says, the girls are having plenty of fun without marriage in the picture. Why change it now?</p>
