<p>We did not have Dianna Agron and Lea Michele staging a mini-reunion with Darren Criss on our 2025 Bingo cards.</p>



<p>But, given what the rest of this year has been like, we&#8217;re more than happy to see this wholesome development!</p>



<p>The <em>Glee </em>alums are putting a smile on people&#8217;s faces. One more than the others.</p>



<p>Where many of her former co-stars have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/lea-michele-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made headlines</a>, Agron has been something of a ghost in recent years. Fans are <em>so </em>happy to see her reappear.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-a-drill-lea-michele-and-dianna-agron-hung-out-in-real-life">This is not a drill! Lea Michele and Dianna Agron hung out in real life!</h2>



<p>Lea Michele and Dianna Agron managed to give <em>Glee </em>fans a delightful shock on Thursday, April 10.</p>



<p>The two actresses staged a miniature cast reunion alongside Darren Criss.</p>



<p>Criss has been on Broadway, in the <em>Maybe Happy Ending</em> musical. Both actresses shared smiling photos with him.</p>

<p>As you can see, Michele took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIRJmsnxalW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page to share a photo of herself. </p>



<p>&#8220;Night out with my beautiful friend from high school to see our former classmate perform on Broadway,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<p>They were not actual high school classmates. </p>



<p>But they did portray classmates at an absurd school on <em>Glee</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-had-such-kind-things-to-say">They had such kind things to say!</h2>



<p>Agron penned a comment in all caps: “LOVED EVERY MINUTE.&#8221; We hope that someone <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/lea-michele-condemns-but-does-not-deny-rumor-that-she-cannot-read/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads</a> those kind words to Michele.</p>



<p>She shared her own photo. It also looks like Criss gave the two of them a look backstage.</p>



<p>“WMHS FOREVER,” Agron wrote, referring to their fictional high school. </p>

<p>“Completely &amp; utterly heartwarming all around &#8212; another huge round of applause for you, Darren.”</p>



<p><em>Glee </em>ended a whole decade ago. Where Lea Michele has been the subject of memes and controversies at times, Dianna Agron seemed to (mostly) vanish from headlines.</p>



<p>Naturally, fans &#8212; of hers, of the whole cast, and of the ship of their respective <em>Glee </em>characters &#8212; absolutely lost their minds on social media.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Folks, we do not mean to be cynical. But we cannot entirely rule out that this was not, in part, a promotional move.</p>



<p>Agron is an actor, even if her roles have been somewhat sporadic over the past decade. However, she happens to be appearing on <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sean-teale-married-romantic-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Odyssey</a></em>.</p>



<p>According to social media, she&#8217;ll be appearing on Thursday night&#8217;s episode. </p>



<p>The timing of this eye-catching reunion seems auspicious.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>It is no secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/heather-morris-lea-michelle-was-a-total-bully-on-the-glee-set/">Lea Michele was a nightmare on the set of <em>Glee</em></a>.</p>



<p>Between bizarre bullying behavior and some pretty direct racism, she made even her unlikable character seem <em>mild </em>by comparison.</p>



<p>Lea has acknowledged a small portion of that. But what about the rumor that she &#8230; can&#8217;t read?</p>



<p>She is condemning that rumor. But she doesn&#8217;t seem to actually be <em>denying </em>it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Lea Michele snapped a backstage selfie before her talk show interview.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some celebrity rumors are just facts lacking confirmation.</p>



<p>Others feel like they might be true, or at least <em>could </em>be true, but are likely to remain a mystery.</p>



<p>And then there are rumors that are blissfully evidence-free.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-289003" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lea-michele-now-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>She remained on Fox as part of the Scream Queens cast and then appeared for the short run of ABC&#8217;s The Mayor, a solid sitcom that was canceled too soon.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The claim that Lea Michele cannot read did not begin as a blind item. It mostly felt like people were saying it just to be mean.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s right up there with &#8220;the Queen died months ago but they&#8217;re waiting to tell us&#8221; as far as rumors go.</p>



<p>By that, we mean that the more that you see jokes about it, the more that you begin to hope in your heart of hearts that it&#8217;s true.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s probably safe to say that Lea herself does not feel that way.</p>



<p>Whether or not she knows how to read, she has at least <em>heard </em>the rumor for herself.</p>



<p>To no one&#8217;s surprise, she is unhappy about it. Whether it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s <em>hurtful and untrue</em> or <em>factual and embarrassing</em> &#8230; who can say?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Probably the breakout star of Season 1, Lynch played the sarcastic and cruel cheerleading coach, Sue Sylvester.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lea has landed her dream role in the (ironically titled) <em>Funny Girl</em> Broadway musical, apparently sending Jane Lynch fleeing for the hills.</p>



<p>(Lynch, who had the unenviable experience of costarring with Lea on <em>Glee</em>, left the production even earlier than expected after Lea&#8217;s casting)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/01/theater/lea-michele-funny-girl-broadway.html"><em>The New York Times</em> spoke to Lea</a> about many things. Including the very natural question of whether or not she can read.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Lea Michele continues her Bed Series with a couple of &#8220;Boyfriend Jeans&#8221; posts and some higher quality photos. Oh, and she&#8217;s topless.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I went to <em>Glee</em> every single day; I knew my lines every single day,&#8221; Lea asserted.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then there&#8217;s a rumor online that I can&#8217;t read or write?&#8221; she marveled. &#8220;It&#8217;s sad. It really is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lea then speculated: &#8220;I think often if I were a man, a lot of this wouldn&#8217;t be the case,&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Lea Michele shows off her smile in this photo, along with her cleavage. We find both to be impressive.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve reread her comments at least a dozen times. </p>



<p>None of it appears to be an actual denial.</p>



<p>Let us do what Lea might or might not be able to do: read through that, line-by-line.</p>

Lea Michele looks gorgeous at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.</figcaption></figure>



<p>First and foremost, she cites having known her lines during her Glee era.</p>



<p>Just for the record, there are many ways of learning lines. It is not uncommon for people on set to read out lines to actors.</p>



<p>She is <em>implying </em>that she read her scripts, but not directly stating that she did.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="757" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-757x1024.jpg" alt="Lea Michele on a Red Carpet" class="wp-image-246348" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-757x1024.jpg 757w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-222x300.jpg 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-768x1039.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-1136x1536.jpg 1136w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-1514x2048.jpg 1514w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-735x994.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-248x335.jpg 248w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-257x347.jpg 257w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-384x520.jpg 384w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-473x640.jpg 473w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-568x768.jpg 568w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-710x960.jpg 710w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-799x1080.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/lea-michele-on-a-red-carpet-scaled.jpg 1893w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Her second point is to comment that the rumor is &#8220;sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes?</p>



<p>False rumors are often sad, in that they speak to the state of the world. True rumors can also be sad. She does not specify which.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-681x1024.jpg" alt="Lea Michele at CMAs" class="wp-image-282346" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-768x1155.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-1021x1536.jpg 1021w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-1361x2048.jpg 1361w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-735x1106.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-425x640.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-510x768.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-638x960.jpg 638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-718x1080.jpg 718w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lea-michele-at-cmas-scaled.jpg 1702w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Lea Michele poses here on the red carpet of the 51st annual CMA awards in Nashville.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, Lea seemingly asserts that no one would be saying this if she were a man.</p>



<p>Sexism is a plague that infects our society and our culture in nearly infinite and pernicious ways.</p>



<p>But &#8230; if Lea is a target for rumors (be they false or true), her gender is likely pretty low on the list. Her history of toxic behavior is the bigger issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>You know what? It&#8217;s possible that fewer people would have spoken up about Lea&#8217;s monstrous on-set behavior if she were a man.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll give her that much.</p>



<p>But, again, no part of her response was an actual denial.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>We can only assume Lea Michele is crying here over just how far Glee fell after a terrific first season.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re sure that, if you asked her (out loud, so that she can understand the question), she&#8217;d tell you that she thinks that the rumor doesn&#8217;t merit a direct denial.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s much, much funnier to believe that Lea Michele cannot read and tiptoed around directly lying about it.</p>



<p>She might not like us saying so. But then, we have a feeling that Lea isn&#8217;t reading this article.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/heather-morris-lea-michelle-was-a-total-bully-on-the-glee-set/">Lea Michele is no one&#8217;s favorite person</a>, there are times when any recovering <em>Glee </em>fan takes notice.</p>



<p>For all of the things that Lea is, she was in love with the late Cory Monteith when he tragically passed away.</p>



<p>Over the years, she has made various public and private tributes to her former castmate and dearly departed love.</p>



<p>This time, Lea is honoring Cory with a song that she performed on <em>Glee </em>&#8212; with a very special significance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Lea Michele is currently on tour for <em>An Evening With Lea Michele: Life In Music</em>.</p>



<p>While there are a lot of obvious jokes to make at Lea&#8217;s expense, and while she does deserve that, Cory Monteith does not.</p>



<p>On July 20, the first show of her tour included a cover of Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;Make You Feel My Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many people have done their absolute best to forget anything and everything from <em>Glee</em>.</p>



<p>But we do recall how Rachel Berry, the character whom Lea played for the duration of the series, sang that exact song.</p>



<p>Even on the show, it was a tribute to Finn Hudson &#8230; who was, in turn, played by Cory Monteith. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/07/0727-Lea-Michele-Tribute-to-Cory-Monteith-in-2022.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s not just any song, either.</p>



<p>At the time, when millions were mourning Cory after his tragic passing, Ryan Murphy approached Lea with a choice.</p>



<p>The creator of Glee invited her to choose which song her character would sing. It was a major decision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Lea Michele snapped a backstage selfie before her talk show interview.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lea and Cory had listened to the song together, multiple times, during their relationship.</p>



<p>The heavy episode was a tribute to Cory, through the lens of being a tribute to Finn.</p>



<p>Understandably, Lea has never personally watched the episode. That makes a lot of sense.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Lea has shared tributes like this for years, usually while marking the anniversary of his 2013 passing.</p>



<p>He died of a tragic overdose. He was only 31 years old.</p>



<p>Though Cory&#8217;s career included numerous roles, including <em>Smallville </em>and <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, the world knows him best for his time on <em>Glee</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>The star quarterback-turned-star-Glee-club member, Cory Monteith was the handsome and kind face behind the character of Finn.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Glee&#8217;s target audience was a decidedly younger crowd &#8212; even those of us who were adults at the time knew that.</p>



<p>As a result, the shock to fans was even greater than it would have been for other demographics.</p>



<p>For many viewers, this was the first time that a lead on a show that they were watching had passed away. The grief was real.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Cory is of course not the only member of the cast to die a tragic death.</p>



<p>Naya&#8217;s passing was more recent, and the horror of it was compounded by the fact that she was a mother.</p>



<p>While Mark Salling&#8217;s death received fewer mourners, people do consider it to be part of a &#8220;<em>Glee </em>curse.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Speaking of cursed things related to <em>Glee</em>, Lea is one of those actors with a reputation for &#8230; difficulty.</p>



<p>Former castmates have spoken out &#8212; some breaking a decade of silence or more &#8212; about how toxic, cruel, and racist she was.</p>



<p>Many people do not like Lea. Even so, paying tribute to Cory&#8217;s memory is something that brings us all together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Glee last aired an episode on Fox in 2015.</p>
<p>All this time later, however, fans ae finally learning just how ironic of a title this was for the musical comedy.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because life on set was anything but gleeful for anyone in the presence of Lea Michele.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>During an interview on the <em>Everything Iconic With Danny Pellegrino</em> podcast this week, Morris delved into the awful behavior exhibited by Michele throughout her run as Rachel Berry on this formerly beloved program.</p>
<p>Just about a year ago, a number of actors and actresses who worked with Michele over the years came out and basically destroyed her, one after another after another.</p>
<p>It all started with Samantha Marie Ware, who appeared on 11 episodes of Glee back in the day and who said Michele made this gig a &quot;<a href="/2020/06/lea-michele-is-the-absolute-worst-pretty-much-everyone-argues/">LIVING HELL</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I BELIEVE YOU TOLD EVERYONE THAT IF TOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD &#8216;S&#8212; IN MY WIG!&#8217;&quot; Ware wrote at the time, addressing Michele directly.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>During her podcast appearance,&nbsp;Morris said she garnered backlash last summer for being &quot;cryptic&quot; after she tweeted of her ex-colleague:</p>
<p>&quot;Was she unpleasant to work with? Very much so.&quot;</p>
<p>How does Morris feel about everything now?</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m like &#8216;Guys, she&#8217;s pregnant, and all this stuff is going around,&#8217;&quot; Morris told Pellegrino.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s true and I don&#8217;t know if maybe we were victims of bullying and that&#8217;s a typical victim thing to do, is to blame yourself, which people were saying.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Michele was expecting her first child right around the time she was being trashed from every direction.</p>
<p>But considering <a href="/2020/06/lea-michele-is-a-horrible-human-being-the-voice-alum-says/">the onslaught of criticism</a>?</p>
<p>Many folks wanted to hear more directly from those who worked most closely with Michele.</p>
<p>And almost no one filmed more scenes with her on Glee than Morris.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to Morris, &quot;the only person who was honest about&quot; Michelle&#8217;s alleged behavior was the late Naya Rivera, who <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2020/07/heather-morris-pays-tribute-to-glee-co-star-naya-rivera-i-know-y/">died last July in a drowning accident</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, Rivera, who played Santana Lopez on Glee, spoke out about her relationship with Michele.</p>
<p>&quot;Santana and Rachel hated each other, but they also had this love-hate sort of relationship,&quot; Rivera told Entertainment Tonight at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like Lea and I had that while we were on the show.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Michele&#8217;s apparent bullying, Morris now says, was &quot;something that was very hush hush on set.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now you see all these things coming out with these bigger names who were very disrespectful and mistreated a lot of people and people allowed it to happen,&quot; she added on the podcast.</p>
<p>&quot;We absolutely could&#8217;ve stepped up and gone to the Fox execs and said how we felt about the situation, and nobody really did.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In response to Ware&#8217;s claims last June, Michele posted an apology on Instagram, writing that she &quot;clearly acted in ways which hurt other people.</p>
<p>This mea culpa included the following passage:</p>
<p>&quot;Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult, I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;ll give the last word here to Morris, reflecting on her time as Brittany S. Pierce:</p>
<p>&quot;We all got close with Lea at certain points and then we all weren&#8217;t as close with her.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s that human element to it, to understanding who this person is, growing with that person, seeing her try to become better, and taking care of herself after Cory passed.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just the elephant in the room.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Lea Michele has a reason to be singing a very happy tune right now.</p>
<p>The <em>happiest</em> tune, to be precise.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Because the actress just gave birth to her first child!</p>
<p>According to People Magazine, which broke this very exciting piece of news, Michele and husband&nbsp;Zandy Reich welcomed the baby back on August 20.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone&rsquo;s happy and healthy, and they&#8217;re extremely grateful,&quot; a source tells this publication, adding:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#8217;s been an easy baby so far.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The couple has reportedly named its first-born Ever Leo.</p>
<p>The little human&#8217;s arrival comes fewer than four months after Michele shared the first photo of her baby bump, noting at the time that she was &quot;so grateful.&quot;</p>
<p>While Michele has kept details of her pregnancy mostly to a minimum, the ex-Glee lead has occasionally shared pictures of herself and her growing belly on Instagram.</p>
<p>She captioned a series of pictures posted on May 25: &quot;Reflection looking a little different these days.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Michele and&nbsp;Reich was first romantically linked in July of 2017.</p>
<p>The latter then proposed to Michele the following April, using a four-carat elongated radiant cut ring that he personally designed to pop the life-altering question.</p>
<p>&quot;Lea has wanted to take it easy for the first part of her pregnancy,&quot; an insider told E! News this spring, adding of the whole pandemic thing:</p>
<p>&quot;She has really enjoyed being present and getting to soak in being pregnant without distractions.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Michele, of course, also made some very negative headlines during her pregnancy.</p>
<p>The star was called out by nearly everyone she&#8217;s ever worked with <a href="/2020/06/lea-michele-is-the-absolute-worst-pretty-much-everyone-argues/">as being an awful influence on set</a>.</p>
<p>She was fired by HelloFresh for instances of racism against past colleagues, which <a href="/2020/06/lea-michele-fired-by-hellofresh-issues-apology-for-past-racism/">prompted Michele to issue an apology</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the most important lessons of the last few weeks is that we need to take the time to listen and learn about other people&#8217;s perspectives and any role we have played or anything we can do to help address the injustices that they face,&quot; she said in the wake of the George Floyd killing and subsequent social justice protests.</p>
<p>Added Michele:</p>
<p>&quot;I have never judged others by their background or color of their skin.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="401" height="594" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards.jpg" alt="Lea Michele Attends Billboard Music Awards" class="wp-image-265475" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards.jpg 401w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-203x300.jpg 203w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-226x335.jpg 226w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-234x347.jpg 234w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-351x520.jpg 351w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Responding to accusations of some heinous ways in which she treated past cast Glee cast members, she said:</p>
<p>&quot;Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused.</p>
<p>We all can grow and change. And I have definitely used these past several months to reflect on my own shortcomings.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I am a couple of months from becoming a mother,&quot; Michele concluded back then. &quot;And I know I need to keep working to better myself and take responsibility for my actions&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I [want to] be a real role model for my child so I can pass along my lessons and mistakes&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I will be better in the future from this experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Welp, now Michele has the opportunity! We wish her the best.</p>

<p>The beloved Glee star and mother of one was just 33 years old.</p>

<p>In a heartbreaking coincidence, Rivera&#8217;s remains were discovered on July 13, the same date that her former co-star <a href="/slideshows/glee-stars-pay-tribute-to-cory-monteith-on-anniversary-of-his-de/">Cory Monteith passed away</a>&nbsp;in 2013.</p>
<p>A difficult time for Rivera&#8217;s castmates has been made even more challenging by macabre talk of a &quot;<a href="/2020/07/glee-curse-reports-anger-fans-following-naya-rivera-tragedy/">Glee curse</a>&quot; and rumors of discord among the group of friends who found fame together.</p>
<p><a href="/2020/07/lea-michele-gets-bullied-by-naya-rivera-fans-deletes-twitter/">Lea Michele was criticized</a> for her failure to issue a statement in the wake of Rivera&#8217;s disappearance, and other former Glee stars complained of the public&#8217;s morbid fascination with the details of Naya&#8217;s final hours and the search for her body.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But now that her loved ones have been granted some closure, the focus can shift from the details of Rivera&#8217;s death to the beauty of tragically short time on Earth.</p>
<p>Michele paid tribute to both Monteith and Rivera by sharing never-before-seen photos from the Glee set on her Instagram Story.</p>
<p>The undoubtedly grief-stricken star &#8212; who is currently pregnant with her first child &#8212; let the images do the talking for her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Michele certainly wasn&#8217;t alone in her grief, as various members of the Glee ensemble took to social media to share fond memories and mourn the loss of a great talent and a kind soul.</p>
<p>&quot;Rest sweet, Naya,&quot; wrote Jane Lynch, who played Sue Sylvester on the show.</p>
<p>&quot;What a force you were. Love and peace to your family.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;My Naya, my Snixxx, my Bee. I legitimately can not imagine this world without you,&quot; tweeted Kevin McHale, who played Artie Abrams on the series.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not religious by any means, but you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to convince me that Cory didn&#8217;t help find our girl today,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;These 2, in many ways, were the male and female versions of one another. So nice, cared deeply, were stupidly talented, the most fun, and really really good people.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>On Instagram, Chris Colfer, who played Kurt Hummel on Glee, shared a lengthy triubte to the woman he called one of his closest friends.</p>
<p>&quot;How can you convey all your love and respect for someone in one post?&quot; Colfer wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;How can you summarize a decade of friendship and laughter with words alone? If you were friends with Naya Rivera, you simply can&#8217;t. Her brilliance and humor were unmatched,&quot; he continued.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Her beauty and talent were otherworldly. She spoke truth to power with poise and fearlessness. She could turn a bad day into a great day with a single remark,&quot; Colfer went on.</p>
<p>&quot;She inspired and uplifted people without even trying. Being close to her was both a badge of honor and a suit of armor,&quot; he concluded.</p>
<p>&quot;Naya was truly one of a kind, and she always will be. Sending all my love to her wonderful family and her beautiful son.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Naya made me laugh like no one else on that set. I always said it while we were working together and I&rsquo;ve maintained it ever since,&quot; wrote Darren Criss, who played Blaine Anderson on the show.</p>
<p>&quot;Her playful, wicked sense of humor never ceased to bring a smile to my face,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;And even as I sit here, struggling to comprehend, gutted beyond description- the very thought of her cracks me up and still brings a smile to my face. That was Naya&rsquo;s gift. And it&#8217;s a gift that will never go away. ⁣</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Rest in peace you wild, hilarious, beautiful angel.&quot;</p>
<p>Broadway legend and Glee regular Kristin Chenoweth summed her feelings toward Rivera in succinct, but poignant fashion, writing:</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for what you gave the world. I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly, Rivera will be deeply missed by many &#8212; but her contributions, her talent, and her indomitable spirit will live on in the hearts of family, friends, and a legion of fans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last week, Hollywood was stunned by the <a href="/2020/07/naya-rivera-family-members-join-search-for-missing-actress/">disappearance of Naya Rivera</a>, who vanished while swimming with her four-year-old son in a California lake.</p>
<p><a href="/2020/07/naya-rivera-assumed-dead-by-authorities-search-continues-for-act/">Rivera is now presumed dead</a>, though search efforts have yet to discover any remains.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Obviously, a tragedy of such magnitude affects countless people in myriad ways.</p>
<p>And one unexpected consequence of Rivera&#8217;s disappearance has been a targeted harassment campaign against her former Glee co-star Lea Michele.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="/2020/06/lea-michele-fired-by-hellofresh-issues-apology-for-past-racism/">Michele was branded a &quot;horrible human being&quot;</a>&nbsp;and accused of racially-motivated bullying by several other actors who starred on the show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Somehow, both her behavior and the consequences she suffered as a result were attributed to the &quot;<a href="/2020/07/glee-curse-reports-anger-fans-following-naya-rivera-tragedy/">Glee curse</a>,&quot; a phenomenon that&#8217;s been widely discussed on social media as a result of misfortunes experienced by several former cast members.</p>
<p>To be clear, Michele&#8217;s abhorrent behavior has nothing to do with Rivera&#8217;s diaappearance any more than it has to do with the <a href="/slideshows/glee-stars-pay-tribute-to-cory-monteith-on-anniversary-of-his-de/">death of Cory Monteith</a> or any oher tragedy that has befallen one of her former colleagues.</p>
<p>Still, some Twitter users saw the disappearance as an opportunity to attack Michele in truly nauseating ways.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Some bashed her for her failure to issue a public statement about Rivera&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>Others suggested her behavior on set caused lasting psychological damage to her co-stars, including Naya.</p>
<p>Still others expressed their belief that it would have been preferable for Michele &#8212; who is eight months pregnant &#8212; to have drowned in a lake instead of Rivera.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In response to the seemingly endless bullying, Michele deleted her Twitter account.</p>
<p>In the day since her account disappeared many other users &#8212; some of them fans of Michele&#8217;s, others simply fans of human decency &#8212; have spoken out against the harassment.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t support Lea Michele&rsquo;s past behavior at any point, but filling her social media with comments like &#8216;it should&rsquo;ve been you&#8217; or &#8216;it&rsquo;s your fault&#8217; to the point that she deactivated it&rsquo;s cruel and gross and you should be ashamed if you left a similar comment,&quot; wrote one user.</p>
<p>&quot;Please normalize not supporting someone like you used to but still having some humanity left for that person,&quot; another added.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="401" height="594" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards.jpg" alt="Lea Michele Attends Billboard Music Awards" class="wp-image-265475" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards.jpg 401w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-203x300.jpg 203w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-226x335.jpg 226w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-234x347.jpg 234w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/lea-michele-attends-billboard-music-awards-351x520.jpg 351w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Lea Michele does not deserve any of this shit she has gotten and it hurts my heart to read every evil thing people have said to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Can y&#8217;all leave Lea Michele alone. She doesn&#8217;t have to address the situation on social media, stop policing how people react&quot;</p>
<p>Harassing someone for the purpose of causing them emotional torment is always wrong &#8212; yes, even in cases when they were guilty of bullying, themselves &#8212; but if that&#8217;s not enough to prevent you from harassing Lea Michele, then do so for Naya Rivera.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This awful situation is disrespectful toward the memory of a talented actress and a devoted mother who was taken much too soon and in horrific fashion.</p>
<p>The focus right now should be on recovery efforts and paying proper tribute to Rivera&#8217;s life and work.</p>
<p>Different people grieve in different ways, of course, but there&#8217;s simply no excuse for connecting Naya&#8217;s name to something as ugly as online bullying.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>As you&#8217;ve probably heard by now, Glee actress <a href="/2020/07/naya-rivera-presumed-dead-in-horrible-drowning-accident/">Naya Rivera disappeared</a> while boating with her son at a lake in Southern California on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tragically, <a href="/2020/07/naya-rivera-assumed-dead-by-authorities-search-continues-for-act/">Rivera is now presumed dead</a>, and authorities have shifted the focus of their efforts from rescue to recovery.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The incident triggered a good deal of talk &#8212; much of it wildly insensitive and disrespectful &#8212; about the challenges Rivera had faced off-camera in the years since Glee ended its six-season season run in 2015.</p>
<p>Some took the macabre speculation a step further by suggesting that the entire cast of the popular Fox musical might be in some way &#8220;cursed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, this is absurd, but it&#8217;s a popular enough argument (at one point on Thursday, &#8220;Glee curse&#8221; was a trending topic on Twitter) that it&#8217;s worth addressing, simply so that it can be put to rest once and for all.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Let us begin by saying, yes, a number of tragedies and public misfortunes have befallen the cast of Glee in recent years.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, male lead <a href="/2013/07/cory-monteith-death-celebrities-send-thoughts-prayers-via-twitte/">Cory Monteith passed away</a> at the age of 30.</p>
<p>Monteith had struggled with addiction throughout his life, but had been sober for over a year at the time of his fatal relapse.</p>
<p>The show addressed his passing with an episode about the death of his character, beloved school quarterback Finn.</p>

<p>Out of respect for Monteith and his loved ones, the cause of Finn&#8217;s passing was never mentioned in the episode.</p>
<p>Sadly, the tabloid press was not quite so respectful. </p>
<p>Also bringing out the worst impulses in America&#8217;s media figures was the sad <a href="/2018/02/mark-salling-cause-of-death-revealed/">death of Mark Salling</a>, who played the rebellious Puck on the show.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/01/mark-salling-suicide-glee-stars-crew-members-react/">Salling committed suicide</a> in 2018 at the age of 35.</p>

<p>At the time of his passing, he was facing a lengthy prison sentence on child porn charges.</p>
<p>Some of the show&#8217;s stars met with far less severe misfortunes, such as Lea Michele, who &#8212; just last month &#8212; was branded a &#8220;horrible human being&#8221; by her former co-stars.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s a pretty minor setback compared to what some of her ex-castmates have endured, but the fact remains that Michele &#8212; who is currently eight months pregnant &#8212; might never again work in Hollywood.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Despite all of these unfortunate turns of events, any talk of a &#8220;Glee curse&#8221; is purely asinine.</p>
<p>As Entertainment Weekly <a href="https://ew.com/tv/glee-curse/">points out</a>, Glee was an ensemble show, and thousands of actors appeared on camera over the course of its run.</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s Wikipedia page lists 24 actors in its &#8220;starring&#8221; section.</p>
<p>With a cast that size, it&#8217;s only natural that a handful of actors would meet with tragedy over the course of several years.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, of course, that a TV show with a cast made up largely of adolescents is not your typical work environment.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;child star&#8221; conjures images of young people being broken by intense pressure coming from the very people who should be looking out for their best interests.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason it doesn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise when such environments foster unusually high rates of addiction and mental illness, and it has nothing to do with some supernatural curse.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rivera dated Salling for a time when they were still on the show, and she stated that she adopted some of his bad behaviors &#8212; including heavy drug use &#8212; during their time together.</p>
<p>All teens face pressure to engage in risky behaviors and the problem is only exacerbated when the peers who are influencing them are independently wealthy and largely unsupervised.</p>
<p>So while the idea of a supernatural curse might make for a more compelling headline the truth of the situation is more commonplace and less mysterious.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But the main reason that talk of a Glee curse is so disrespectful is that it turns the grief experienced by these actors&#8217; loved ones into ghost story fodder.</p>
<p>It also suggests that terrible fates are yet to befall the show&#8217;s dozens of other cast members.</p>
<p>Thus, people who are already grieving the loss of a former colleague are forced to imagine thousands fantasizing about their death.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The fact is, Naya Rivera took her 4-year-old son on a boating expedition; they jumped in the water to go swimming, and she never resurfaced.</p>
<p>Stories don&#8217;t get much sadder than that, and Rivera &#8212; a tremendous talent and devoted mother &#8212; deserves to be mourned as an individual cut down in her prime, not as further evidence of some absurd campfire story.</p>
<p>Please keep that in mind when commenting on her passing on social media.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to Naya&#8217;s loved ones during this immensely difficult time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>After being exposed for&nbsp;<a href="/2020/06/samantha-marie-ware-lea-michele-threatened-to-ruin-my-career/">threatening to ruin careers</a>&nbsp;and for being an&nbsp;<a href="/2020/06/lea-michele-is-a-horrible-human-being-the-voice-alum-says/">all-around horrible human being</a>, Lea Michele wants to remind fans of something.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>super&nbsp;</em>pregnant, and therefore, no one can criticize her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Last month, Lea Michele was called out for abhorrent and unprofessional behavior over the course of, well, her entire career.</p>
<p>The Glee alum apologized and (dare we say,&nbsp;<em>wisely</em>) fled social media under the avalanche of long-suppressed callouts.</p>
<p>Now, she has returned from her social media hiatus, dipping her toes into the proverbial water to find out if the coast is clear (yes, that&#8217;s a mixed metaphor).</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Taking to her Instagram Stories, Lea shared a glimpse of her showing off her growing baby bump while enjoying the outdoors.</p>
<p>There were multiple shots of her on a hiking trail.</p>
<p>Lea can be seen wearing a black mask, a black sports bra, and matching leggings &#8212; but all eyes are on the baby bump.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Under other circumstances, people might be happy to see Lea pregnant.</p>
<p>Despite her reputation as a veritable monster on set, that reputation mostly arose from indirect rumors and accusations in the past.</p>
<p>A lot of people with a misplaced sense of nostalgia for&nbsp;<em>Glee&nbsp;</em>might look at Lea and admire her perceived personal growth.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, Lea &#8212; among some other white women who were called out in early June &#8212; has been accused of hiding behind her pregnancy.</p>
<p>Even her initial apology mentioned her pregnancy.</p>
<p>She did not explicitly write &quot;you can&#8217;t be mean to me, I&#8217;m pregnant!&quot; but many critics got the impression that she hoped that they would feel that way.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, the callouts that Lea received were enough for HelloFresh to almost immediately terminate their relationship with her.</p>
<p>Is that a big deal in Lea&#8217;s life, when she is already worth an estimated $12 million? Probably not.</p>
<p>But it was a symbolic statement that the company had more sense than to continue to be associated with someone so toxic.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;LMAO REMEMBER WHEN YOU MADE MY FIRST TELEVISON GIG A LIVING HELL?!?! CAUSE ILL NEVER FORGET,&rdquo; Samantha Marie Ware tweeted last month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I BELIEVE YOU TOLD EVERYONE THAT IF TOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD &#8216;S&#8211;T IN MY WIG!&#8217;&quot; she recalled.</p>
<p>That memory was &quot;AMONGST OTHER TRAUMATIC MICROAGRESSIONS THAT MADE ME QUESTION A CAREER IN HOLLYWOOD&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Dabier Snell, who had been a guest star on Glee, had a similar recollection.</p>
<p>He accused Lea of forbidding him from sitting at the table with the rest of the cast because he &quot;didn&#8217;t belong.&quot;</p>
<p>One could not help but notice that these two accusers were both black &#8212; and they were not alone.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Yvette Nicole Brown had the misfortune of working with Lea more than once.</p>
<p>She suggested on Twitter that she has more horrific stories than she would care to count.</p>
<p>And seeming to target black actors with vicious bullying is not the only thing of which Lea has been accused.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>A transgender model who goes by Plastic Martyr shared a horror story of her own.</p>
<p>She recalled being in the bathroom at an awards show and washing her hands when Lea allegedly confronted her, challenging her right to be there.</p>
<p>Plastic was horrified. It&#8217;s important to note that in some cases, trans women being &quot;challenged&quot; for going to the bathroom has put them in real physical danger.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So yes, Lea&#8217;s baby bump looks great and she is finally back on social media.</p>
<p>But that does not mean that anyone has forgotten her actions in the past.</p>
<p>After all, antics like that have not been forgotten by the victims &#8212; and we don&#8217;t know how many careers were changed for the worse by Lea&#8217;s behavior.</p>
