<p>Ally Lewber has finally opened up.</p>



<p>Amid rumors that she had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ally-lewber-remains-separated-from-james-kennedy-despite-his-desperate-attempts-to-win-her-back-report/">ended her relationship with James Kennedy</a>, the Vanderpump Rules star issued a statement on Thursday that confirmed the following:</p>



<p>Yes, the romance is over.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1005" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1005x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517528" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1005x1024.jpg 1005w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-768x783.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-2010x2048.jpg 2010w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-942x960.jpg 942w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1060x1080.jpg 1060w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1178x1200.jpg 1178w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Kennedy and Ally Lewber attend Giorgio Armani And FIAT Event In Beverly Hills at Giorgio Armani on November 20, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for FIAT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for all your support and kindness,&#8221; Lewber wrote in a post shared to her Instagram Stories yesterday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am happy that prosecutors decided not to file against James as I never desired criminal charges. We had an argument outside of his home related to him drinking again, however, I was not physically hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>This statement marked the first time Lewber addressed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-get-the-details/">Kennedy&#8217;s arrest for domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>And certainly the first time she confessed to being the victim.</p>

Rodriguez/Getty Images for DailyMail.com)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The astrologer admitted she was &#8220;shocked by the headlines and disheartened by how the event was portrayed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lewber also addressed speculation over her status with Kennedy by stating for the social media record:</p>



<p>&#8220;We are no longer together, but I&#8217;ll always support James and wish him the best with his sobriety and healing. Thank you for your understanding.&#8221;</p>



<p>On December 10, Kennedy was arrested after the Burbank Police Department was called to his Los Angeles home &#8220;regarding an argument between a man and a woman,&#8221; a police spokesperson confirmed at the time to various outlets.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old has not publicly spoken out about his break-up with Lewber. </p>



<p>However, his lawyer said on January 22 that James is &#8220;continuing to focus on his sobriety and his DJ career&#8221; after prosecutors declined to move forward with his case.</p>



<p>Lewber, who had been dating Kennedy since 2021, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/ally-lewber-moves-out-of-home-she-shared-with-james-kennedy-following-domestic-violence-arrest/">moved out of the former couple&#8217;s shared home</a> last month.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been pretty clear for awhile now that the future was bleak.</p>



<p>&#8220;There were no grounds for any charges to be filed against Mr. Kennedy,&#8221; his attorney said in a statement to E! News, adding that the the reality star &#8220;is grateful to have this matter behind him.&#8221;</p>



<p>And now, meanwhile, he also has his relationship with Ally Lewber behind him. We wish these two the best moving forward.</p>

<p>We still don&#8217;t know if James will face charges for the incident, but it seems that the events of that night have had a major impact on his relationship.</p>



<p>Neither James nor Ally has yet offered up any specifics about the events leading up to the arrest.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1401225469-1024x683.jpg" alt="James Kennedy and Ally Lewber attend the 2022 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards: UNSCRIPTED at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California and broadcast on June 5, 2022.

<p>But she did post a statement in which she thanked fans for their support during this difficult time. </p>



<p>And now, it looks as though Ally has decided to move out of the home she had been sharing with James.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Ally is moving out permanently or if this is just a temporary break.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the Ohio native has assured her loved ones that she&#8217;s not in any danger.</p>



<p>“Ally has been telling friends she’s doing OK. She’s definitely safe and not in danger with James,&#8221; an insider tells Page Six.</p>

<p>“I’m OK and taking the time I need right now,” she wrote on Instagram. “I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.”</p>

<p>“We are in the process of conducting our own investigation into the allegations levied by the Burbank Police Department against James,” Kennedy’s lawyers, Scott Leemon and Leonard Levine, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-breaks-silence-on-domestic-violence-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement</a> issued earlier this week. </p>



<p>“We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that after careful review, the city attorney’s office will decide not to file formal charges.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me,&#8221; Lewber wrote, adding on her account:</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m okay and taking the time I need right now. I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Previously, a spokesperson for the Burbank Police Department confirmed that cops were called to Kennedy&#8217;s Los Angeles home on Tuesday, December 10, &#8220;regarding an argument between a man and a woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s since been widely assumed that the woman at the center of this alleged incident was Ally Lewber.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-682x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515220" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2173471926-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Kennedy and Ally Lewber arrive at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival at T-Mobile Arena on September 20, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images for iHeartRadio)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear,<strong> authorities did not say whether the woman involved was Lewber</strong>.</p>



<p>However, they noted that their investigation &#8220;determined it was a domestic incident, leading to [Kennedy&#8217;s] arrest.&#8221; </p>



<p>The DJ was &#8220;booked for misdemeanor domestic violence and later posted bail. Formal charges are pending review by the Burbank City Attorney’s office.&#8221;</p>



<p>Insiders say Kennedy is accused of grabbing a woman amid some sort of argument.</p>

<p>Officers who responded to the scene did not see any visible injuries on the victim, according to TMZ, while Kennedy has been released after posting a $20,000 bail.</p>



<p>He and Lewber started dating in 2022, with the latter coming on board <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/vanderpump-rules/">Vanderpump Rules</a> as a cast member a short time later.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Lewber denied speculation that Kennedy was physically abusive during their relationship, most notably inside of a vehicle two years ago after the MTV Movie Awards.</p>



<p>“That never happened. There was no physical altercation,” Lewber told Scheana Shay on her podcast in February.</p>

<p>Kristen Doute, meanwhile, dated Kennedy from 2013 to 2015.</p>



<p>She took to her Instagram Stories in December 12&#8230; shared an article detailing the incident&#8230; and then simply wrote, “Finally.”</p>



<p>For their part, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-breaks-silence-on-domestic-violence-allegations/">Kennedy&#8217;s lawyers issued a statement</a> this past Friday that read as follows </p>

<p><em>We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that, after careful review, the city’s attorneys will decide not to file formal charges.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-james-kennedy">What&#8217;s Next For James Kennedy?</h2>



<p>James has yet to personally speak out on the matter.</p>



<p>But earlier today, his attorneys issued a statement on his behalf, and it seems they&#8217;re trying to convince the DA&#8217;s office not to file charges.</p>



<p>“We are in the process of conducting our own investigation into the allegations levied by the Burbank Police Department against James,” attorneys for Kennedy said, according to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vprs-james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>. </p>

<p>“We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that, after careful review, the city’s attorneys will decide not to file formal charges.”</p>



<p>During a 2023 episode of her podcast, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/scheana-shay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scheana Shay</a> asked Ally about rumors that James had assaulted her in a car after the MTV TV &amp; Movie Awards.</p>



<p>“That’s crazy to me that that’s the most asked question [for me]. That makes me really sad, because no, I’m good. That never happened. There was no physical altercation,” she said (via <em>Us Weekly</em>). </p>

<p>“Yes, we were in the car together. I thought we were having fun. We were having fun. But then James and I did get into an argument, but there was no physical assault,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was not bleeding, and they didn’t have to get out of the car and separate us. So that didn’t happen. That’s all I’ll say on that.”</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/12/lala-kent-james-kennedy-is-the-worst-and-his-girlfriend-is-a-dum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James is sober</a> after a long and very public battle with alcoholism.</p>



<p>Ally has confirmed that James is still working on himself, including his &#8220;anger issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p><em>When did it start? How brazen were their PDAs? Did they really think they could get away with it?</em></p>



<p>These were the questions on the minds of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> fans when they first learned of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/tom-sandoval-tried-to-convince-his-family-to-accept-raquel-leviss-but-they-werent-having-it/">affair between Tom Sandoval and Raquel Leviss</a>.</p>



<p>And now, after weeks of hearsay and speculation, we&#8217;re finally getting an objective account of the scandal through the eyes of a Bravo camera crew.</p>



<p>Yes, last night&#8217;s episode of VPR offered the series&#8217; first hints at the emergence of the Scandoval.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The episode was filmed back in late August, a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/tom-sandoval-was-obsessed-with-raquel-leviss-before-affair-seethed-with-jealousy-when-she-hooked-up-with-schwartz/">Raquel had recently hooked up with Tom<em> Schwartz</em></a>, and no one on the cast suspected that she would soon wrap her long limbs around Tom Sandoval.</p>



<p>No one, that is, except for James Kennedy&#8217;s girlfriend Ally Lewber, who spied Leviss and Raquel on the dance floor late at night and had the good sense to suspect that something might be up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ally Lewber is James Kennedy&#8217;s girlfriend. And apparently, she&#8217;s quite the detective! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I saw Sandoval and Raquel dancing together at The Abbey,&#8221; she recalled in a confessional. </p>



<p>&#8220;I personally wouldn&#8217;t be comfortable with it, I guess, to have my boyfriend out at 1 a.m. with girls. But everyone&#8217;s different,&#8221; Lewber continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it was kind of weird,&#8221; Ally told James, adding, &#8220;It was like 1 a.m. and we were like, &#8216;Where is Ariana?'&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Folks, this is the reality TV equivalent of the moment in history when someone said, <em>Hey, what are those guys snooping around the Watergate Hotel so late at night?</em></p>



<p>James was dismissive, figuring &#8212; as everyone did in those days &#8212; that Leviss had her eye on Schwartz.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed how much Raquel&#8217;s been hanging out with the Toms, both of them,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put too much to it.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-473328" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1391276341-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA &#8211; APRIL 13: Raquel Leviss attends CLD Pre-Coachella House on April 13, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

<p></p>



<p>Adding to the smokescreen was the fact that Raquel was about to go on her first real date with Oliver Beauvais.</p>



<p>That turned into a mini-scandal of its own, as Oliver was accused of lying to Raquel when he claimed that he was separated from his wife.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a tough reason for any other <em>Vanderpump</em> subplot (sorry, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/scheana-shay-and-brock-davies-married/">Scheana&#8217;s wedding</a>!) because viewers really only care about the Scandoval.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Raquel has done a lot of crying this season. (Photo via Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Fortunately, this thing is so big that just about every cast member is involved in one way or another.</p>



<p>Later in the episode, Raquel took a seat between Tom and Tom during her shift at SUR.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you like it so much?&#8221; Lisa Vanderpump asked Sandoval. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a smile on your face.&#8221;</p>



<p>Little did she know!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8211;</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The episode ended on a foreshadowing note, as things got tense in a conversation between Sandoval and Katie Maloney.</p>



<p>“You get a lot of joy out of Raquel as well,” Katie said to Sandoval at Lala&#8217; birthday party. “You go to The Abbey together at one o’clock in the morning.”</p>



<p>“Dude, what the f—k are you even saying? Get the f—k out of here, man,&#8221; Tom shot back.</p>



<p>Folks, those are the words of a man who knows he&#8217;s been busted big time.</p>
