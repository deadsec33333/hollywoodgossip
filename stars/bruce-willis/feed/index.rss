<p>Demi Moore is speaking out about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/bruce-willis-speaks-in-joyful-video-in-wake-of-dementia-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce Willis&#8217; battle with dementia</a>.</p>



<p>Bruce and Demi were married from 1987 to 2000, and while their divorce was not an entirely civil one, they developed a stable friendship and co-parenting relationship in the years that followed.</p>



<p>She rarely speaks about her ex publicly, but Demi opened up recently when asked about Bruce&#8217;s condition.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demi-moore-shares-update-on-ex-husband-bruce-willis">Demi Moore Shares Update on Ex-Husband Bruce Willis</h2>



<p>Speaking with Christiane Amanpour about her film <em>The Substance</em>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/demi-moore-joe-jonas-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demi Moore</a> offered some candid comments about her ex&#8217;s courageous battle.</p>



<p>“Given the givens, he’s in a very stable place at the moment,” the 62-year-old actress shared in an interview with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/entertainment/video/demi-moore-the-substance-bruce-willis-health-digvid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>. </p>



<p>“And I’ve shared this before, but I really mean this so sincerely. It’s so important for anybody who’s dealing with this to really meet them where they’re at, and from that place, there is such loving and joy.”</p>



<p>Demi added that Bruce&#8217;s condition is “very difficult” and is “not what I would wish upon anyone.”</p>

<p>“There is great loss, but there is also great beauty and gifts that can come from it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bruce-s-battle">Bruce&#8217;s Battle</h2>

<p>The illness has forced him to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/bruce-willis-retires-from-acting-due-to-serious-health-condition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">step away from public life</a>, but his loved ones continue to offer updates on his condition.</p>



<p>“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” Bruce and his family wrote on Instagram at the time of his diagnosis.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-999468462-1024x683.jpg" alt="Bruce Willis attends the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis at Hollywood Palladium on July 14, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>“As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbu-CyELWio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They continued</a>: “This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.”</p>

<p>Bruce and Demi share three daughters together: Rumer, 36, Scout, 33, and Tallulah, 30.</p>



<p>And while it&#8217;s been nearly a quarter century since the A-list stars went their separate ways, it&#8217;s clear that the father of her children still holds a place in Demi&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>We wish Bruce and his family all the best as they fight this battle together.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>One year ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/bruce-willis-retires-from-acting-due-to-serious-health-condition/">Bruce Willis retired from acting</a>. Despite his more recent roles in broadly panned projects, this came as a shock.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, his family disclosed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/bruce-willis-diagnosed-frontotemporal-dementia-family-says-actors-condition-has-rapidly-deteriorated/">Willis&#8217; diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia</a>. This not only explained reports of his aphasia, but made it clear that this is not a temporary condition.</p>



<p>However, there are treatments to ease some symptoms of this degenerative disease.</p>



<p>The acting legend turned 68 over the weekend. And, in a heartwarming home video, the public can hear him speak for the first time since his diagnosis became public.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It&#8217;s the birthday boy! Bruce Willis turned 68 years old on Sunday, March 29, 2023. He had plenty of family around to celebrate and sing to him. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sunday was Bruce Willis&#8217; birthday. He turned 68 years old.</p>



<p>His wife, Emma Heming Willis, was there. So were daughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah.</p>



<p>Demi Moore &#8212; who, lest we forget, was his spouse for more than a decade &#8212; was present at the celebration. And she decided to film it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On his 68th birthday, acting legend Bruce Willis delighted as his family sang to him to mark the occasion. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Everyone present sang &#8220;Happy Birthday.&#8221; It&#8217;s an inherently awkward tradition, both for the chorus of singers but especially for the recipient.</p>



<p>However, Willis has had decades more practice receiving birthday songs than many of it. He managed to make things seem less awkward.</p>



<p>While he did briefly appear to lose his balance a couple of times, he was fine. And he blew out his birthday candles with excitement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It was Demi Moore who recorded Bruce Willis&#8217; birthday bash and uploaded the heartwarming video with a touching caption. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, Willis sang along with a few words of the song.</p>



<p>And, though what anyone is saying in this gleeful crowd is anyone&#8217;s guess, he clearly spoke to his family during the video.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy birthday, BW! So glad we could celebrate you today. Love you and love our family,&#8221; Demi captioned the short video. &#8220;Thank you to everyone for the love and warm wishes &#8212; we all feel them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Celebrity well wishes poured in. Fans, too, commented to congratulate Willis on his birthday.</p>



<p>Others praised Demi Moore and other celebrants for the display.</p>



<p>Of course, some asked why Willis appeared to be missing a tooth. Perhaps some trick of the light? Perhaps not. It is unlikely that his family will explain, as it is <em>certainly </em>not anyone&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>Most significantly for fans, the video represents a window for fans to see Willis as he is living life with frontotemporal dementia.</p>



<p>This degenerative disease has no cure. It does, however, have treatments.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Willis has both a loving and supportive family and virtually unlimited financial resources. Again, it&#8217;s no cure, but his loved ones can give him his best shot at continuing to live life.</p>

<p>More than a year ago, reports whispered that Willis was struggling to play even small roles in his direct-to-video movie projects. Then came news of his retirement, and aphasia &#8212; a struggle with language.</p>



<p>His diagnosis of dementia made it all make sense. But, clearly, he has not lost his ability to understand or lose language altogether.</p>



<p>We wish Bruce Willis a very happy (and belated, at this point) 68th birthday.</p>

<p>Tragic news put of Hollywood today, as the family of Bruce Willis has shared a discouraging update about the screen icon&#8217;s ongoing health issues.</p>



<p>The family announced last year that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/bruce-willis-retires-from-acting-due-to-serious-health-condition/">Willis would retire from acting </a>after being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that impaired his ability to speak.</p>



<p>Now, Willis&#8217; wife, Emma Heming Willis, has revealed that the <em>Die Hard </em>star&#8217;s condition has deteriorated further.</p>



<p>According to Emma, Bruce was recently now been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">&#8220;Our family wanted to start by expressing our deepest gratitude for the incredible outpouring of love, support and wonderful stories we have all received since sharing Bruce&#8217;s original diagnosis,&#8221; Emma wrote on Instagram. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">&#8220;In the spirit of that, we wanted to give you an update about our beloved husband, father and friend since we now have a deeper understanding of what he is experiencing.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-6">&#8220;Since we announced Bruce&#8217;s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce&#8217;s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD),&#8221; she continued. </p>

<p></p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-6">&#8220;Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.&#8221;</p>



<p>Emma added that Bruce is not able to speak for himself on this matter, but she knows that he would wish to use his platform to create greater awareness for the sake of others who are suffering.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately,&#8221; she said. </p>

<p>&#8220;We know in our hearts that – if he could today — he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.&#8221;</p>



<p>Emily concluded with a message of gratitude to those who have offered kind words and support throughout this difficult journey.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bruce has always found joy in life – and has helped everyone he knows to do the same,&#8221; she ended. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us. </p>



<p>&#8220;We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time. Your continued compassion, understanding, and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>As its name indicates, frontotemporal dementia is a condition that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, areas that control speech, as well as motor skills such as walking.</p>

<p>It is the most common form of dementia affecting individuals under the age of 60.</p>



<p>At press time, Bruce&#8217;s other loved ones, including his five children and his ex-wife Demi Moore had not yet spoken publicly about his diagnosis.</p>



<p>News of the Hollywood legend&#8217;s condition has made Willis an international trending topic, as tributes and words of support have poured in from fans all over the world.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to the Bruce and his family as they confront this new challenge together.</p>

<p>The message opens:</p>
<p>&quot;To Bruce&#8217;s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him,&quot; the caption added.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the statement was signed by daughter Rumer Willis, along with her mom, Demi Moore, Bruce&rsquo;s wife, Emma Heming, and Rumer&rsquo;s sisters, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel and Evelyn.</p>
<p>These Instagram posts went on to say that it &quot;is a really challenging time&quot; for them all, and:</p>
<p>&quot;We are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to Mayo Clinic, aphasia &quot;is a condition that robs you of the ability to communicate.</p>
<p>&quot;It can affect your ability to speak, write and understand language, both verbal and written.&quot;</p>
<p>The medical group adds that the condition &quot;typically occurs suddenly after a stroke or a head injury.</p>
<p>&quot;But it can also come on gradually from a slow-growing brain tumor or a disease that causes progressive, permanent damage (degenerative).&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>So very, very sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,&quot; the Willis family message also says.</p>
<p>Rumer &#8211; who is the eldest child of the Sixth Sense actor and ex-wife Moore &#8211; concluded by sharing the family&rsquo;s new motto.</p>
<p><strong><em>As Bruce always says, &lsquo;Live it up&rsquo; and together we plan to do just that.</em></strong></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Willis has starred in such hit films as Die Hard, The Sixth Sense, Armageddon, Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, 12 Monkeys and Sin City.</p>
<p>More recently, he starred in the 2018 Eli Roth-directed hit action-thriller Death Wish.</p>
<p>Over the course of his impressive career, Willis won a Golden Globe Award and two Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>He has several projects lined up for a 2022 release, all filmed before today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In the wake of this medical and professional news, a number of celebrities took to social media to express their surprise and sorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Sending lots of love and healing to you all!&quot; wrote Katie Couric, for example.</p>
<p>&quot;Grace and guts! Love to you all!&quot; wrote Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>
<p>&quot;We love Bruce so much. Sending love to him and your family. Bruce has given us sooo much! What an amazing career. May he rest and recover,&quot; added Debi Mazar.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll give the final word here to&nbsp;Randall Emmett, who directed Willis in last year&#8217;s <em>Midnight in the Switchgrass:</em></p>
<p>&quot;Bruce and I have worked on over 20 films together. He is a terrific actor and legendary action star, an incredible father and a close friend.</p>
<p>&quot;I fully support Bruce and his family during this challenging time and admire him for his courage in battling this incredibly difficult medical condition.</p>
<p>&quot;Bruce will always be a part of our family.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Rumer Willis led the pack last night, but the most noteworthy aspect of the <a href="/2015/04/dancing-with-the-stars-results-shock-in-the-ballroom/">Dancing with the Stars results</a> show was getting her whole family back together!</p>
<p>Check out this epic selfie featuring Rumer (in full DWTS garb) with sisters Scout and Tallulah Willis, her father Bruce Willis AND her mother Demi Moore!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rumer Willis&#8217; family has been supporting her all season long, but this Instagram photo together was pretty all-time &#8230; &#8217;cause it doesn&#8217;t happen all the time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Rumer, 26, in the back, in her Ursula outfit from The Little Mermaid (it was Disney Night), flanked by Bruce, 60, Demi, 52, Scout, 23, and Tallulah, 21.</p>
<p>The competitor really looks like her mom, doesn&#8217;t she? If Demi also dressed up like Ursula, and both wore Demi&#8217;s glasses, they&#8217;d be hard to tell apart.</p>
<p><a href="/stars/tallulah-willis/">Tallulah Willis</a> posted the pic online, captioning it simply &quot;#familyportrait #rare.&quot;</p>
<p>It certainly brings back the days before Bruce and Demi split, but the couple has remained close to each other and their kids throughout the years.</p>
<p>There was plenty for this modern family to cheer about on Monday, too.</p>
<p>Rumer and pro partner Val Chmerkovskiy earned 39 points out of 40 following a sexy samba set to &quot;Poor Unfortunate Souls&quot; from <em>The Little Mermaid</em>.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s in first place and looking like a contender. Others? Not so much.</p>
<p>Suzanne Somers was eliminated, <a href="/2015/04/chris-soules-makes-witney-carson-cry-on-dancing-with-the-stars/">Chris Soules made Witney Carson cry</a> and ABC tried to blend animation with live dancing in an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>It was an eventful night in the ballroom for sure!</p>
