<p>And&#8230; they&#8217;re&#8230; off.</p>



<p>At last.</p>



<p>Just over a year since they became husband and wife, David Woolley and Christine Brown finally embarked several days on a trip to honor this occasion.</p>



<p>Yes, they went on a honeymoon.</p>

<p>The Sister Wives cast members very recently visited a number of European destinations &#8212; including Barcelona, Spain, and Florence, Italy via a Virgin Voyages Cruise.</p>



<p>And it sure sounds like a grand time was had by all.</p>



<p>“We are finally on our honeymoon!!” Brown wrote on Instagram on November 4, sharing footage of the couple&#8217;s travels&#8230; including a trip to the famous Sagrada Familia. </p>



<p>“Yep, a year later, we just decided to take our time and go when we were ready. We LOVE Barcelona! The architecture, food and people!!”</p>

<p>Brown and Woolley exchanged vows in Moab, Utah in October 2023.</p>



<p>The former, of course, was in a relationship with Kody Brown for well over two decades prior to walking away from the self-centered polygamist in late 2021.</p>



<p>She has pretty much gushed over Woolley ever since the two got together, often referring to him <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">as her soulmate and her forever love</a>.</p>



<p>In a photo uploaded to Instagram in June, the 52-year old shared a snapshot of herself and her husband enjoying a quiet evening while watching the sunset.</p>



<p>“Every step of my journey brought me here,” Brown captioned pictures of the couple with their backs to the camera.</p>



<p>“Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.”</p>

<p>“Florence took my breath away. Masterpieces everywhere!” Christine wrote on her November 11 Instagram video, captioning it as follows: </p>



<p>“I have been craving a trip to Florence since I watched the 1985 A Room with A View #dreamcometrue #florence #duomo #virginvoyages #honeymoon #needtogoback.”</p>

<p>“I feel like it’s nice to start over again in a new chapter,” Christine previously told E! News of her life with David. “We’re also starting over in a new chapter.”</p>

<p>An introduction will be made this upcoming Sunday night on Sister Wives.</p>



<p>In a sneak peek published by Us Weekly, series patriarch Kody Brown meets his ex-spouse&#8217;s boyfriend for the first time&#8230; and it goes just about as you&#8217;d expect it to go.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Woolley is featured in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>During a family Valentine’s Day-themed gathering, Christine Brown initiates the major moment after Kody and Robyn Brown walk into the house and, well, there&#8217;s really no other option.</p>



<p>“How’s it going?” David Woolley <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sister-wives-clip-kody-brown-meets-david-woolley-for-1st-time/">says in the clip</a>, to which Kody replies, “David, nice to meet you. [I‘m] Kody.”</p>



<p>Christine, of course, was Kody&#8217;s spiritual sister wife for well over 20 years. She ended the relationship way back in November of 2021.</p>



<p>The current season of Sister Wives, however, was filmed ages ago&#8230; hence the first time Woolley meets Kody on this future installment, despite <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-snubs-her-sister-wives-no-wedding-invite-for-you/">Woolley and Christine having gotten married</a> in October 2023.</p>

His name is David Woolley.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After Christine introduces David to Robyn on the November 10 episode, Kody gets right into it. </p>



<p>“How long have you guys been dating?” he asks. </p>



<p>“A month and a half,” Christine answers, noting that she’s known David a little while longer.</p>



<p>“You’ve seen the kids? You know the kids?” Kody then asks, referring to his and Christine’s six children and their grandchildren. </p>



<p>“He’s met everybody,” Christine reveals, which appears to get under her ex-husband&#8217;s skin because he didn&#8217;t realize the relationship was that serious.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="581" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1024x581.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-511866" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1024x581.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-300x170.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-768x435.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-960x544.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1080x612.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1200x680.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682.webp 1240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley sit for an interview on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It gets even more awkward after Kody and Christine’s daughter Mykelti chimes in, telling her father that Woolley “babysat them by himself while we went and got pedicures.</p>



<p><em><strong>Wow</strong></em>, Kody says.</p>



<p>Woolley ends up giving Kody and Robyn a bit of his backstory.</p>



<p>“I’m used to a lot of kids. I’ll have 10 grandkids. I have eight kids,” he explains. “I’ve been around polygamy my whole life. I’m used to a lot of kids. Large groups don’t bother me at all.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-05-at-11.38.15%E2%80%AFAM-1024x617.png" alt="Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives" class="wp-image-489675"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following their brief back-and-forth, Woolley sits down for a confessional and recalls the tension he felt with Kody.</p>



<p>“The first thing he said was, ‘I heard you held my grandkids.’ And Mykelti says, ‘Well, he did more than that, he babysat them,’” David tells Christine of his conversation with Kody, claiming: </p>



<p>“He got really red in the face.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kody didn&#8217;t reveal any sort of embarrassment, but noted the following on air:</p>



<p>&#8220;What was interesting is David made more eye contact with Robyn and talked to Robyn way more than me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine and David recently celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary, with the dad of eight calling their relationship “one hell of a ride.”</p>



<p>“I was in Sedona a few weeks ago, it’s really really pretty there, just like [Christine] is. I’m so glad she found me, and stalked me,” David captioned his post on October 15, which featured a selfie of the spouses. </p>



<p>“She’s the most thoughtful, loving, caring person. I’m enjoying this ride and just want to keep riding.”</p>

<p>As the relatively new husband of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/christine-brown/">Christine Brown</a>, David Woolley is now also a new series regular on Sister Wives.</p>



<p>For this reason, the 60-year old is suddenly a public figure&#8230; which means viewers are suddenly very interested in Woolley&#8217;s personal life.</p>



<p>This include a tragedy that only recently came to light.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="581" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1024x581.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-511866" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1024x581.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-300x170.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-768x435.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-960x544.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1080x612.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682-1200x680.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/family-tragedy-sister-wives-star-872541682.webp 1240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley sit for an interview on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Woolley has seven siblings, one of whom is named Karen and who currently lives in Utah. But she formerly resided in Mexico.</p>



<p>In awful news broken earlier this year by The Sun, Karen&#8217;s daughter, Dawna Ray Langford, along with Dawna&#8217;s two kids, Trevor Harvey Langford and Rogan Jay Langford, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/10119809/sister-wives-christine-brown-husband-niece-children-murdered-mexico/">tragically died in November 2019</a>.</p>



<p>They were three of the victims of a widely-covered Mexico massacre that left three American mothers and six children dead.</p>



<p>Simply awful.</p>

<p>The nine total victims were part of a Mormon community living in northern Mexico that were traveling back to the United States in separate SUVs when they were ambushed.</p>



<p>This group had dual citizenship and was reportedly headed to a wedding in Chihuahua, approximately 100 miles south of the Arizona border.</p>



<p>Local authorities down south said the family drove into an area where there had been a shootout between rival cartel gangs &#8211; who had an ongoing battle over territory &#8211; earlier that day and were mistakenly attacked by one of the cartels.</p>



<p>The cartel members shot at the vehicles on a highway, killing the victims on November 4.</p>



<p>Dawna was 43 years old and her two sons, Trevor and Rogan, were 11 and 2, respectively.</p>

<p>Christine and David got married in October 2023, about a year and a half after going public with their romance.</p>



<p>Neither has talked openly this family tragedy, although it hasn&#8217;t appeared to have impacted their successful relationship.</p>



<p>“Every step of my journey brought me here,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">Brown captioned pictures of the couple</a> in June with their backs to the camera.</p>



<p>“Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.”</p>

<p>Woolley has been featured extensively on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/sister-wives-season-19-updates/">Sister Wives Season 19</a>.</p>



<p>“I didn’t intentionally have it be Kody’s opposite,” Christine told E! News this year, taking a not-so-subtle shot at her ex-spouse.</p>



<p>“But then when we were talking about it, I realized it kind of was, I guess. I wanted a partner and I wanted someone who’s good at communicating. I wanted someone who was attracted to me.</p>



<p>“But the bald and tattoos and motorcycles, I was just ready for a bit of a rebel.”</p>

<p>Season 19 of <em>Sister Wives</em> is but a few weeks away, and if the trailers are any indication, this season is going to be a ROLLER COASTER!</p>



<p>Between new marriages, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/janelle-brown-cancer-scare-sister-wives-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer scares</a>, and the shocking news of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/garrison-brown-cause-of-death-sister-wives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death of one of Kody&#8217;s sons</a>, season 19 is poised to be emotional. </p>



<p>It also plans to take us back in time a bit to show how the hell the Brown family got to this point to begin with. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know so far. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-05-at-11.38.15%E2%80%AFAM-1024x617.png" alt="Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives" class="wp-image-489675"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sister-wives-season-19-first-look-answers-a-lot-of-questions">&#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; Season 19 First Look Answers A LOT of Questions</h2>



<p>On August 13, TLC finally confirmed not only that Sister Wives was coming back for another season, but also the first trailer for Season 19.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so much to unpack right from the get to, including the fact that clearly this season was filmed quite some time ago.</p>



<p>The trailer focus on Christine and David&#8217;s courtship, Meri&#8217;s move to Utah, and a showdown between Kody and Robyn, the last woman standing. </p>



<p>In the press release, the network teased just exactly what&#8217;s to come:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sister Wives Returns September 15th at 10/9c on TLC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhfzMx8JJDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;There has been much change over the past few years, where all the Browns are facing new pathways forward.&nbsp; Meri takes her recent decision to leave Kody one step further by appealing to their former church for an official “release” (their version of a divorce). Janelle doesn’t need a divorce and is just moving on, which for her means moving away from Flagstaff. Christine has found her soulmate, David.&nbsp; </p>



<p>&#8220;In less than a year, they go on their first date, move in together, and then marry at a beautiful wedding surrounded by family and friends in Moab, Utah. While three of Kody&#8217;s wives have left, his fourth wife Robyn remains legally married to him.  Now that the Browns have left polygamy behind, Robyn and Kody face challenges together as a monogamous couple and how to adapt to a lifestyle they never planned on living.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a secondary trailer released two weeks before the premiere, Kody shares just how out of control everything is &#8211; meaning that he no longer has a hold on his wives.</p>



<p>“They have all BETRAYED me,” he yells to&#8230; Robyn? The woods? The audience? Too soon to tell on that one!</p>

<p><em>Sister Wives</em> is set to return to TLC on&nbsp;Sunday, September 15 at 10PM ET/PT.</p>



<p>While fans are happy to have the news confirmed, it was pretty much a given after one of Kody&#8217;s kids spilled the beana.s </p>



<p>Of late, Mykelti Brown and her husband, Tony Padron, have been sitting down for a number of YouTube videos, most recently telling fans that they are moving from Utah to North Carolina.</p>



<p>“My mom, she is happy for our adventure,” Mykelti recently said of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/christine-brown/">Christine Brown</a>&#8216;s reaction to the decision. </p>



<p>“She supports our choices because we’re doing it for us, as a family, but she’s also extremely sad that we’ll be leaving her.”</p>



<p>Along with this bombshell drop, meanwhile, a Reddit user quoted Christine&#8217;s daughter as saying the show would be back by late August or early September. </p>



<p>This individual went on to note that Mykelti has been revealing various teases regarding what viewers can expect from <em>Sister Wives</em> Season 19:</p>



<p>“The season will include her pregnancy with the twins, as well as Christine and David dating.&#8221;</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t verify whether these spoilers or accurate or not, but she does show up in the trailer above, so it is very possible. </p>



<p></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-david-woolley-joining-sister-wives-season-19-in-big-way">David Woolley Joining &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; Season 19 In BIG WAY</h2>



<p>Now here&#8217;s the other thing: Christine married <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolle</a>y ALL the way back in October 2023.</p>



<p>Heck, the ceremony was even filmed for a TLC special.</p>



<p>Were these upcoming episodes truly filmed SUCH a long time ago that we&#8217;ll be simply watching them date on Season 19? The answer is, after watching the trailer, yes. </p>



<p>We get to see their first date, their journey to falling in love &#8211; AND David meet Kody for the first time!</p>



<p>Regardless of the timeline, Christine Brown sat down with <em>People Magazine</em> at the start of 2024 and made it very clear that David would be in the new season.</p>



<p><strong>O</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;People are going to be seeing a lot with the two of us,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/christine-brown-teases-a-lot-more-husband-david-sister-wives-exclusive-8558116">Brown told the publication</a> in a joint interview with David, adding:  &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited for everybody to meet David more, because he&#8217;s really genuine.&#8221;</p>



<p>As loyal <em>Sister Wives</em> fans know, Christine split from Kody Brown in November 2021, writing on Instagram back then:</p>



<p>&#8220;We will continue to be a strong presence in each other&#8217;s lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Christine later met Woolley on a dating website and went public with the relationship on Valentine&#8217;s Day of 2023.</p>



<p>&#8220;I finally found the love of my life, David,&#8221; she said at the time, clearly very smitten. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-david-is-already-used-to-the-cameras">David Is Already Used To The Cameras</h2>



<p>Fast forward to October of 2023, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/christine-brown-marries-david-woolley-get-all-the-romantic-details/">Christine and David were married</a>, and so, his career in reality tv took off. </p>



<p>First, he sat alongside Brown for a discussion <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/david-woolley-debuts-on-sister-wives-has-something-to-say-about-kody-brown/">on the <em>Sister Wives</em> one-on-one special</a> that aired in December; then he got tons of screen time when TLC followed the pair around for their special, Sister Wives: Christine and David&#8217;s Wedding.</p>



<p>But with Season 19, he will have his firs legitimate run as a cast member.</p>



<p>&#8220;They threw me to the wolves,&#8221; joked Woolley to People, who said he &#8220;never wanted to be on camera&#8221; before meeting and falling for Christine.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s accepted and embraced this new aspect of his life, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, I tried, but then I ended up talking over him and then I feel really bad,&#8221; Brown jumped in with <em>People</em>, explaining how she has done all she can to take the lead on air. </p>



<p>&#8220;When the interview with the one-on-one with [host] Suki [Krishnan], she was like, &#8216;How did you propose?&#8217; And I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Let me tell you.&#8217; And I just totally took over.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the last few years, it&#8217;s become clear that Meri has had a falling out with her plural family. </p>



<p>After leaving Kody, her relationship with the other wives start to deteriorate. For one thing, she was not at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/why-meri-brown-didnt-attend-christines-wedding-sister-wives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine&#8217;s wedding</a>. For another, she sat along at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/garrison-brown-funeral/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garrison&#8217;s memorial</a>, separate from Janelle and the kids (more on that in a second.)</p>



<p>However, whatever drama is happening with the other women, Meri is still part of the TV family. She confirmed on <em>Miss Understood Podcast</em> with Rachel Uchitel that she would be back for season 19. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m around,&#8221; she insisted, though gave no details on the show filming. She simply added, &#8220;I’m very excited. I’m&nbsp; not going anywhere.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-will-sister-wives-season-19-deal-with-garrison-brown-s-death">How will &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; Season 19 Deal With Garrison Brown&#8217;s Death?</h2>



<p>While the family sounds prepared to kick off another season, things took a turn for the devastating on March 5. That&#8217;s when it was announced that Janelle and Kody&#8217;s son Garrison died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. </p>



<p>The news saddened the world over, given that the young man was on 25 and that he was just starting to rebuild his life in Arizona. Garrison famously had a falling out with his famous father, but was still incredibly close with his mother. </p>



<p>Now we know that, not only is the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/sister-wives-canceled-in-wake-of-garrison-brown-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">show is cancelled,</a> but that the season will do a fast-forward to showcase the aftermath of Garrison&#8217;s death. </p>



<p>&#8220;This season, the family faces the devastating passing of Janelle and Kody&#8217;s son, Garrison Brown. Through the heartbreaking pain, the family navigates this incredible tragedy and comes together to mourn and celebrate his life,&#8221; reads the press release. </p>



<p>This confirms reports from <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/10594112/sister-wives-brown-family-film-aftermath-garrison-death-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em> that suggested that the show was indeed in production at the time of Garrison&#8217;s passing. </p>



<p>&#8220;As sad as it is, his unexpected death came during the timeline of filming,&#8221; a family source shared with the outlet. </p>



<p>Garrison&#8217;s strained relationship with father Kody was a family focus last season and the source claims that TLC will want to &#8220;continue the storyline and fans are going to expect to know what happened to him.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-sister-wives-be-canceled-after-season-19">Will &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; Be Canceled After Season 19?</h2>



<p>Given everything we&#8217;ve heard, the likelihood that the show is cancelled is low. Undoubtedly, the family will want to share their next steps in the wake of tragedy with fans. </p>



<p>But who will star on the show? </p>



<p>It will include Christine and David; a now-single Janelle Brown; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/meri-browns-boyfriend-full-name-questionable-past-revealed/">Meri Brown and maybe her new ex-boyfriend</a>; and then Kody and Robyn Brown, who remain legally married.</p>



<p>But since this was taped, so much has changed. Everyone has moved off of Coyote Pass, started new lives &#8211; really started new lives. </p>



<p>Is it even the same show anymore if the all the wives are scattered to the wind.</p>



<p>The idea of season 20 really feels far fetched. </p>

<p>It took her awhile to get here.</p>



<p>It took some pain and some struggle and really challenging times that made her wonder just what life had in store for her.</p>



<p>In the end, however? For Sister Wives star Christine Brown?</p>



<p>It was all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, you see, Brown reflected on how far she has come &#8212; and how it all led to a marriage that makes her feel like the luckiest woman alive.</p>



<p>In a photo uploaded to Instagram on June 17, the 52-year old shared a snapshot of herself and husband David Woolley enjoying a quiet evening while watching the sunset.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every step of my journey brought me here,&#8221; Brown captioned pictures of the couple with their backs to the camera. </p>



<p>&#8220;Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a lovely tribute.</p>



<p>Christine and David got married in October 2023, about a year and a half after going public with their romance.</p>



<p>They met on a dating app, months after Christine ended her spiritual union with Kody Brown.</p>



<p>Is her relationship with Woolley perfect? No. Can it be messy? Yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/christine-brown-embraces-messy-marriage-to-david-woolley/">Christine has admitted</a>. But she is just SO, SO happy. It&#8217;s clear.</p>

<p>In September 2023, the mother of six told People Magazine that her now-spouse “has more integrity than anybody I know. He built his business while he was being a single dad, so it’s everything to him.”</p>



<p>Seemingly taking a jab at Kody, Christine continued back then:</p>



<p>“His word is his bond, and it means everything to him…. If he says he’s going to do it, he’s going to do it.</p>



<p>“He’s a phenomenal person, to the core. He’s just outstanding. I just feel like I won a gold mine. I won the lottery with him.”</p>

<p>Christine has also said in the past that she didn&#8217;t know life could be so &#8220;simple.&#8221;</p>



<p>As you might expect, things can be a tad complex when you are one of four sister wives.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know I would find a soulmate. I totally found a soulmate. He’s totally my soulmate, and I didn’t even know,&#8221; Brown previously added, noting: </p>



<p>“I come with a lot of complications, and he loves me — and that’s the best thing of all.”</p>

<p>As for Woolley?</p>



<p>He&#8217;s already <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/david-woolley-debuts-on-sister-wives-has-something-to-say-about-kody-brown/">appeared on Sister Wives</a> and will basically be a main cast member on Season 19 as well.</p>



<p>“He wears his emotions on his sleeve,” Woolley told Sister Wives reunion host Suki Krishnan of Kody last year, adding for emphasis:</p>



<p>“A lot. And sometimes you’ve got to not— — but that’s him. That’s who he is, I can’t say anything differently.”</p>



<p>Viewers could tell that David was watching his words carefully at the time, making sure <em>not</em> to rock any boats too hard. Not to stir up any controversy.</p>



<p>And yet…</p>



<p>“Would I be like that? No. It’s just, he wants you to hear him,” Woolley added, taking an understandable shot at Kody on air.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s official.</p>



<p>Christine Brown and David Woolley are not just husband and wife &#8212; <em>that</em> status was made official during a romantic ceremony this past October &#8212; they are also husband and wife co-owners of a brand new home&#8230; and  business.</p>



<p>The couple dropped this bombshell during a recent interview with People Magazine.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ve done a lot of traveling and guess what? We bought a house in Moab,” <a href="https://people.com/christine-brown-and-david-woolley-are-opening-an-airbnb-in-moab-utah-exclusive-8579236">Christine told this outlet</a> this week, explaining in exciting detail: </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re going to do an Airbnb with it. </p>



<p>&#8220;We figure everybody should come to Moab and love Moab. So we bought a house there for a way for us to escape too.”</p>



<p>In an Instagram caption she shared alongside photos from inside of this residence, Christine noted that the location just 30 minutes away from where the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/christine-brown-marries-david-woolley-get-all-the-romantic-details/">newlyweds exchanged vows</a> this past fall.</p>

<p>“David and I have an Airbnb in Moab! It will be available March 1st! Here’s a sneak peek! I’ll get the link posted when it’s available so you can start booking a place to stay for your awesome adventures,” the mother of six told social media followers in the message.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Moab &#8212; which is home to Arches National Park &#8212; was actually named the friendliest city in the United States.</p>



<p>According to The Sun, the house purchased by Brown and Woolley sold for $676,000.</p>



<p>The desert home has three bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms and comes with a two-car garage and has over 1,5000 square feet of living space.</p>

<p>Christine and David reside in Lehi, Utah.</p>



<p>They went public with their relationship exactly one year ago, on Valentine&#8217;s Day in 2023.</p>



<p>“I finally <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/christine-brown-introduces-boyfriend-to-the-world-meet-my-soulmate/">found the love of my life</a>, David,” Brown wrote as a revealing caption back then, adding in a gushing tone:</p>



<p>“The first time he held me close, it felt like my soul took it’s first breath.</p>



<p>“He’s wonderful and kind, incredible with my children and an adorable grandpa. I never dreamed I could find a love like this.”</p>

<p>Wow, huh? You could tell it was pretty serious right away.</p>



<p>A few months later, Christine admitted that she wasn&#8217;t looking for The One when she started online dating a couple years ago.</p>



<p>But then she met Woolley and, well&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/christine-brown-let-me-tell-you-all-the-ways-david-woolley-is-better-than-kody-brown/">realized was that David loves me</a>. He loves me, and I feel so loved,” she said on the most recent Sister Wives one-on-one special.</p>



<p>“With that comes a confidence that I can just be me. There’s no strings attached to it. Nothing. I don’t have to do anything to earn his love.</p>

<p>Christine split from Kody Brown, her spiritual spouse of well over two decades, in November 2021.</p>



<p>She clearly has no regrets, either.</p>



<p>“People are going to be seeing a lot with the two of us,” Brown recently said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/david-woolley-coming-to-sister-wives-season-19-big-time/">about Sister Wives Season 19</a> and her husband&#8217;s role on it.</p>



<p>“I’m really excited for everybody to meet David more because he’s really genuine.”</p>

<p>“We were talking about our wedding and things like that,&#8221; she told this publication. </p>



<p>&#8220;And then just through the discussion he’s like, ‘Look, you have people that have been watching you for 14 years now and they’ve been following your story and now you have this romance and you have everything that you wanted. And I think they would appreciate watching it.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Added Woolley of the reception, which took place in Utah:</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew she wanted her fairytale wedding, and so I wanted to give her what she wanted on that part, too. And I did, too.”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not exactly news that Christine Brown adores David Woolley.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star <em>did</em> go ahead and marry him, after all.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s gushed incessantly over Woolley ever since, recently comparing her husband to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/christine-brown-compares-david-woolley-to-ice-cream-in-like-a-really-romantic-way/">perfect flavor of ice cream</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all very sweet and romantic and we really are so very happy for Christine, who has left her life of polygamy far behind.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-05-at-11.38.15%E2%80%AFAM-1024x617.png" alt="Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives" class="wp-image-489675"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But what about the reality star&#8217;s children?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been rather well-documented that Christine <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/christine-brown-i-left-kody-because-hes-an-awful-father/">believes ex-spouse Kody Brown was an awful father</a>, which contributed a great deal to why she decided to leave him in November 2021.</p>



<p>One would therefore think Brown&#8217;s kids are fully on board with Woolley, who has eight kids of his own that he shared with his late wife?</p>



<p>And, well, one would be correct in this assumption.</p>

<p>In footage from the upcoming TLC wedding special that will feature Christine and David exchanging vows, the former&#8217;s daughters gather around to discuss the major occasion.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are very excited for mom&#8217;s wedding. Well, I&#8217;m excited, I don&#8217;t know, are you excited?&#8221; Aspyn Brown Thompson says at one point, turning toward her sister, Ysabel Brown.</p>



<p>“I’m excited. Are you excited?” she replies &#8230; and then the camera pans to Christine’s youngest daughter, Truely Brown, who nods her head.</p>

<p>From there, Aspen asks Truely if she&#8217;s prepared for her mother to get married the next day, prompting the following reply:</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I already live with both of them. They live in the same house. I refer to David and her as husband and wife already and she&#8217;s like, &#8216;We&#8217;re not married yet.&#8217; And I&#8217;m like, &#8216;You live in the same house.&#8221;</p>



<p>For her part, meanwhile, Mykelti says she has &#8220;already accepted [David] as our stepfather,&#8221; a proclamation we&#8217;re certain will put a huge smile on the lips of Christine.</p>



<p>Eventually, the sneak peek shifts to Christine&#8217;s daughters in a different setting &#8212; Ysabel explaining why she&#8217;s <strong><em>so</em></strong> happy that her mother has found her soulmate.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s obsessed with her and so it&#8217;s nice to see that. And he should be. She&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/christine-brown-marries-david-woolley-get-all-the-romantic-details/">Christine and David got married in October</a> at Red Cliffs Lodge in Moab, Utah.</p>



<p>“It’s a fairytale,” Brown told People Magazine shortly after her lovely wedding ceremony, adding at the time:</p>



<p>“It’s everything I never thought I would have. I get to walk down the aisle to David, him just looking at me the way that he does, it’s a dream come true.”</p>



<p>Brown’s son, Paedon, and her dad walked her the down aisle, according to various reports from this fall; while Christine wore a dress from Boda Bridal to the altar.</p>

<p>Christine Brown is about to be a married woman.</p>



<p>On television, that is.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/christine-brown-marries-david-woolley-get-all-the-romantic-details/">Sister Wives star exchanged vows</a> in early October in front of many family and friends as part of a glorious Utah wedding, as loyal fans of the series and this cast member must know by now.</p>



<p>But the nuptials were also filmed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-04-at-1.52.00%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Christine Brown and David Woolley on vacation" class="wp-image-489569"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley are enjoying each other&#8217;s presence in this sweet photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Part 1 of <em>Sister Wives: Christine and David’s Wedding</em> will premiere on TLC and Max Sunday, January 7 at 10/9c&#8230; while part 2 is scheduled to air exactly one week later.</p>



<p>Ahead of these specials, Christine has sat down for a number of promotional interviews.</p>



<p>Speaking to E! News, for example, Brown said that she only joined a dating website with something &#8220;casual&#8221; in mind, having split just a few months prior from mostly evil husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/kody-brown/">Kody Brown</a>.</p>



<p>But then she went out with Woolley.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the way home from the date, I realized, &#8216;Oh, this is it. He&#8217;s the one,'&#8221; <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1391929/why-sister-wives-christine-brown-almost-went-on-another-date-the-day-she-met-david-woolley">Christine told E!</a>. &#8220;And so I had another date that night scheduled. And I cancelled it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Added the mother of six:</p>



<p>&#8220;I met David and I realized this is the ice cream flavor that I had in mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;And it was perfect. And then I was going to say something about a melting but that was just too corny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine also revealed here that she actually had a matchmaker at the time.</p>



<p>But she quickly called up this individual and said she didn&#8217;t need any &#8220;help&#8221; any longer in the romance department.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intentionally have it be Kody&#8217;s opposite,&#8221; Christine also told E! News, taking a not-so-subtle shot at her ex. </p>



<p>&#8220;But then when we were talking about it, I realized it kind of was, I guess. I wanted a partner and I wanted someone who&#8217;s good at communicating. I wanted someone who was attracted to me. </p>



<p>&#8220;But the bald and tattoos and motorcycles, I was just ready for a bit of a rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Christine, it was actually her new husband&#8217;s idea for the couple&#8217;s nuptials to air on television.</p>



<p>“We were talking about our wedding and things like that,&#8221; Brown just told In Touch Weekly. </p>



<p>&#8220;And then just through the discussion he’s like, ‘Look, you have people that have been watching you for 14 years now and they’ve been following your story and now you have this romance and you have everything that you wanted. </p>



<p>&#8216;&#8221;And I think they would appreciate watching it.'&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;re guessing the check TLC likely cut Christine and David helped in their decision, as well.</p>



<p>Referring to Christine&#8217;s fans, Woolley also told In Touch:</p>



<p>“I knew that they wanted to be part of it, and I had no problem with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was different to see all the cameras and everything and all this stuff going on. I thought we were at a royal wedding, and it was like, ‘Wait a minute, this is my wedding.’ This is weird. </p>



<p>&#8220;Because there was too much attention going on. It was crazy.”</p>

<p>The truth came out on the final episode of Sister Wives Season 18.</p>



<p>To some extent, at least.</p>



<p>On part four of the show&#8217;s one-on-one special, Christine Brown&#8217;s brand new husband made his first-ever appearance on the reality program&#8230; opening up at one point about Christine Brown&#8217;s <em>former</em> husband.</p>



<p>So, what, exactly, does David Woolley think about Kody Brown?</p>

<p>“He wears his emotions on his sleeve,” Woolley told host Suki Krishnan of Kody, adding for emphasis:</p>



<p>“A lot. And sometimes you’ve got to not— &#8212; but that’s him. That’s who he is, I can’t say anything differently.&#8221;</p>



<p>Viewers could tell that David was watching his words carefully, he was making sure not to rock any boats too hard. Not to stir up any controversy.</p>



<p>But&#8230;</p>



<p>“Would I be like that? No. It’s just, he wants you to hear him,” Woolley added, taking an understandable jab at Kody on air.</p>

<p>For his part, Kody has basically been unraveling right in front of our eyes over the past few weeks.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s been dumped by three different women over the past two-plus years and has said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/kody-brown-questions-existence-of-god-in-wake-of-plural-marriage-collapse/">he isn&#8217;t even sure if God exists</a> at this point as a result of the break-ups.</p>



<p>On this interview special, Kody couldn&#8217;t help but continue to blast Christine, who married Woolley in October, about 23 months after she split from the father of her six kids.</p>



<p>“This has unraveled my family, and she’s riding off into the sunset!” Kody lamented to Krishnan.</p>

<p>Kody went on to assert that Christine has been dragging him left and right in the media in order to herself look better in the eyes of her alleged soulmate.</p>



<p>“Here’s the thing: for David’s sake, David Woolley’s sake, Christine has to destroy my character, or David doesn’t feel like he can marry her, because she left a good man,&#8221; Kody actually said during his sit-down.</p>



<p>“I’m not a bad guy,” he continued. “Christine and I just weren’t in a good marriage.”</p>



<p>This may be the case, of course.</p>



<p>Not that Kody has come across very positively throughout this ongoing season of the show.</p>

That&#8217;s probably a good thing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kody also went off on Christine for, what he believes, is the unfair way he has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/kody-brown-hits-low-point-as-a-dad-trashed-for-cruel-treatment-of-daughter/">portrayed in the eyes of his sons and daughters</a>.</p>



<p>“[Christine] needs to stop telling my children I’m not then,” Kody said sternly on air. “I’m not going to let that go &#8212;  ever! &#8212; until those kids come to me.”</p>



<p>Thankfully, Christine was rather relaxed about the whole thing during her interview session on part four.</p>



<p>“I’m not married to him anymore! I don’t have to be all, ‘Ohhh. I’m so sorry!” she said simply.</p>



<p>And there it is, right? We love it. What else needs to be said?</p>
