<p>The recent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">death of Aaron Carter</a> has led to renewed interest in the circumstances of other celebrities who found success at a young age, encountered hard times, and then passed away under mysterious circumstances.</p>



<p>One such ill-fated star was Brittany Murphy, the actress who made a name for herself with winning performances in films like <em>Clueless</em> and <em>Girl, Interrupted</em> before losing her life at the age of 32.</p>



<p>Despite multiple books and documentaries on the subject, fans still are not satisfied by the official explanation surrounding Murphy&#8217;s mysterious death.</p>



<p>Brittany would have turned 45 this week, and the bizarre circumstances of her passing remain fertile ground for conspiracy theories.</p>

<p></p>



<p>On December 20, 2009 LA firefighters responded to a &#8220;medical request&#8221; at the LA home that Murphy shared with husband Simon Monjack.</p>



<p>Murphy was transported to Cedars Sinai hospital, where she died two hours later after going into cardiac arrest.</p>



<p>The official cause of death was listed as pneumonia, with secondary factors of severe iron-deficiency anemia and multiple drug intoxication.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The drugs found in Murphy&#8217;s system were hydrocodone, acetaminophen, L-methamphetamine, and chlorpheniramine, all of which are legal and rarely result in fatal overdoses.</p>



<p>Throughout her career, Brittany denied persistent rumors that she suffered from addiction or an eating disorder.</p>



<p>&#8220;There have been so many rumors in the past couple years!&#8221; Murphy told <em>Cosmopolitan</em> in 2004. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not perpetuate something that isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; the actress continued, explaining:</p>



<p>&#8220;But no, I&#8217;ve never had an eating disorder. And I don&#8217;t do drugs. I have a glass of champagne now and then. I&#8217;m generally the person dancing at a party who everybody always thinks is the intoxicated one, but I&#8217;m really not.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a later interview, Murphy reiterated that she rarely drank alcohol, and denied reports that she was addicted to cocaine:</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;No, just for the record I have never tried it in my entire life, I&#8217;ve never even seen it, and I don&#8217;t leave the house too much, except to go to work,&#8221; she told <em>Jane</em> magazine in 2005.</p>



<p>Speculation about Brittany&#8217;s private life increased again in 2007, when she married an unknown British writer and photographer named Simon Monjack. </p>



<p>&#8220;She wanted to marry him and I said, &#8216;Honey, it&#8217;s not been long enough,'&#8221; recalls Murphy&#8217;s friend and <em>King of the Hill</em> co-star Kathy Najimy.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Sharon [Brittany&#8217;s mother] was for the marriage…We were all scared and freaked out, like, who was this guy and what was happening?&#8221;</p>

(Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for IMG)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rather creepily, Simon recalled that Brittany was &#8220;too young to touch&#8221; when he first met her, adding, &#8220;To make a long story short, I was very patient.&#8221;</p>



<p>Regarding the rumors about why the pair married so after they started dating (Monjack&#8217;s US visa was reportedly on the verge of expiration), Brittany&#8217;s husband explained, &#8220;We never addressed it [publicly], and I&#8217;m not going to now.&#8221;</p>



<p>In one of her final interviews, Murphy was asked about her plans for the upcoming year:</p>



<p>&#8220;As far as having a New Year&#8217;s resolution, I&#8217;d love to have a child next year,&#8221; she shared. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Brittany Murphy is missed by millions. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very blessed to have a really great loving husband. I spend more time with my family than anyone else in the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just weeks later, Murphy passed away.</p>



<p>Deepening the mystery is the fact that Monjack died just five months later under similar circumstances.</p>



<p>His death was also attributed to an unusual combination of health problems, including pneumonia.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Brittany Murphy&#8217;s cause of death remains a mystery. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The timing has led to theories that the ill-fated husband and wife were living in a home that was infested with toxic mold.</p>



<p>But all these years later, fans still aren&#8217;t satisfied by any of the answers to the question of what killed Brittany Murphy.</p>



<p>And at this point, it seems unlikely that the mystery will ever be solved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>For most of her adult life, Britney Spears&#8217; social media use was carefully monitored by the conniving manipulators who controlled her conservatorship.</p>
<p>Prior to that, her public life was strictly controlled by a team of handlers who ensured that she projected the most profitable image possible at all possible.</p>
<p>So in a sense, we&#8217;re just now getting our first glimpses of the real Britney.</p>
<p>And the 40-year-old mother of two is making up for lost time by really baring all.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And we&#8217;re not just talking about the<a href="/videos/britney-spears-bares-glorious-body-again-on-steamy-beach-vacatio/"> topless photos Britney has been posting</a> recently.</p>
<p>After years of having her communications with fans strictly regulated, Britney is living her best life and speaking her truth directly to her 40 million Instagram followers.</p>
<p>When <a href="/2021/09/britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-yup-were-engaged/">Britney got engaged to Sam Asghari</a> back in September of last year, she shared the news with fans herself.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And now, some commenters are convinced that Spears has subtly revealed that she went ahead and <a href="/2021/09/britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-desperate-to-marry-asap/">married Asghari</a> in a low-key ceremony sometime in the past week.</p>
<p>&quot;Such an amazing pic of my husband @samasghari !!!!&quot; Brit captioned the photo above.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#8217;s such a hard worker and he amazes me each day with his passion for life !!!! I&#8217;m so lucky to be able to share my life with him &hellip;. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, Brit just casually referred to Sam as her husband.</p>
<p>Fans were quick to take note with many offering words of congratulations to &quot;Britney Asghari.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10579225/Britney-Spears-calls-Sam-Asghari-HUSBAND-fans-rush-congratulate-pop-star.html">According to</a> UK tabloid<em> The Daily Mirror</em>, even Rosie O&#8217;Donnell commented &quot;Congratulations&quot; on Britney&#8217;s post.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sam commented as well, and interestingly, he didn&#8217;t deny that he and Britney are hitched.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m saying no more cake baby no please,&quot; Ashgari wrote.</p>
<p>Cake? Like wedding?! Or was Britney just <em>jokingly</em> referring to Sam as her husband, something that she&#8217;s done at least once before?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Well, if these two are really married, then they got hitched very recently.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Brit referred to Sam as her fiance while wishing him a happy birthday.</p>
<p>&quot;Happy Birthday &nbsp;to my Fianc&eacute; &hellip; I love you so much &hellip; I want a family with you &hellip; I want it all with you !!!!&quot; she captioned the pic below.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So yeah, she and Sam probably aren&#8217;t married, but it sounds like they <em>are</em> planning on having a kid together.</p>
<p>And if that&#8217;s not exciting news, we don&#8217;t know what is!</p>
<p>Another post of Britney&#8217;s that&#8217;s raising eyebrows this week concerns the mysterious 2009 death of Britany Murphy.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Medical investigators attributed Murphy&#8217;s passing to multiple drug toxicity and untreated pneumonia.</p>
<p>But many fans feel that the whole story has never been made public, and it seems that Spears is among those who still have questions:</p>
<p>&quot;I saw this online today &hellip;. is anybody else curious ???&#8217;&quot; the singer wrote this week, alongside an October <em>People</em> magazine cover with a photo of Murphy.</p>

<p>&quot;She died at 32 &hellip; HMMMMMMMMMMM&hellip; JUST SAYING !!!! Psss I know it was a while ago but come on &hellip;they are STILL INVESTIGATING !!!!&quot;</p>
<p>Five months after Murphy passed away, her fiance, Simon Monjack died in the same house.</p>
<p>Drug toxicity and pneumonia are also listed as Monjack&#8217;s causes of death.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Britney didn&#8217;t mention this in her post, but she&#8217;s the one who sold the house to Murphy.</p>
<p>Spears briefly lived there while she was dating Justin Timberlake.</p>
<p>TMZ reports that the pop icon decided to move out simply because she didn&#8217;t like the vibe of the place.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Bizarrely, Monjack said that Murphy had qualms of her own and considered the house &quot;unlucky.&quot;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know if there was any foul play involved, but the situation is certainly suspicious.</p>
<p>And if anyone knows about all the shady shenanigans that happen in Hollywood, it&#8217;s Mrs. Spears-Asghari!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been over a decade since Hollywood lost a rising star.</p>
<p>And yet:</p>
<p>Movie fans across the globe remain in a state of shock any time the subject turns to Brittany Murphy, who passed away on December 20, 2009 at the very young age of 32.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The actress was best known for her role in the Alicia Silverstone comedy Clueless, although she also voiced a regular character on King of the Hill and appeared in such hits as Sin City and Little Black Book.</p>
<p>Why is her tragic and shocking death a relevant topic all these years later?</p>
<p>Because HBO Max announced last month that it will air a docuseries about her life and passing.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>“Our Brittany Murphy documentary cuts through the tabloid noise with an elevated, nuanced depiction of a sensational story,” explained Jennifer O’Connell, EVP, Non-Fiction and Live-Action Family Programming of HBO Max to Deadline.</p>
<p>“Crafting a grounded account of Brittany Murphy’s life struggles and sudden passing comes with great responsibility,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we’ve partnered with a masterful creative team to produce a thoughtful examination of a tragedy that has long been cause for speculation.”</p>
<p>Cynthia Hill will direct this project, which will be produced by Blumhouse Television and Pyramid Productions.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Murphy collapsed in the bathroom of her California home around 8 a.m. on December 20, 2009.</p>
<p>She was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, but pronounced dead at 10:04 a.m., not long after her arrival.</p>
<p>Her death was ruled accidental and eventually determined to have been caused by a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and “multiple drug intoxication,” the Los Angeles County coroner said at the time.</p>
<p>Months later, however, her husband, Simon Monjack, <em>also</em> passed away. </p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Moreover, his death was <em>also</em> allegedly caused by severe anemia and acute pneumonia, a ruling that heightened questions and speculation over Murphy’s passing.</p>
<p>To this day, rumors continue to circulate over just what happened to both Murphy and Monjack.</p>
<p>The former&#8217;s death was previously the subject of a documentary, Brittany Murphy: An ID Mystery, which aired last year on Investigation Discovery.</p>

<p>“I agreed to do this film because I think it’s a shame that Brittany’s promising life and career has been eclipsed by the circumstances of her death,” said Hill in March.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it’s important to celebrate Brittany’s talent as we struggle to explain the tragic circumstances of her and Simon’s deaths.”</p>
<p>HBO Max is yet to announce a premiere date for this documentary.</p>

<p>On the personal side, Murphy famously dated Ashton Kutcher for a period of time.</p>
<p>“Today, the world lost a little piece of sunshine,” the actor Tweeted after she died.</p>
<p>“My deepest condolences go out to Brittany’s family, her husband, and her amazing mother, Sharon.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you on the other side, kid.”</p>

<p>The actress, just 32 at the time of her passing, had earned both critical and commercial success as a result of her work in such beloved films and television shows as Clueless and King of the Hill.</p>
<p>But while Murphy was mourned by millions, the mysterious circumstances of her death soon overshadowed the many achievements of her short life.</p>

<p>Brittany died at her home in West Hollywood, and an autopsy concluded that her death was a result of pneumonia and multiple drug toxicity.</p>
<p>However, nearly twelve years later, fans and internet sleuths continue to believe there&#8217;s more to the story.</p>
<p>Deepening the mystery is the fact that Murphy&#8217;s husband, Simon Monjack, died of the same causes just five months later.</p>

<p>This week, HBO announced a documentary that will feature new information about Murphy&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the two-part film will explore Brittany&#8217;s life as well as the “mysterious circumstances surrounding [her] tragic death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal of the filmmakers is to “go beyond the conspiracy theories and headlines, featuring new interviews by those closest to Brittany and new archival footage.”</p>

<p>Few celebrity deaths have captivated the public as thoroughly as Murphy&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Hers was the sort of public persona that led fans to regard her less as a celebrity and more as a personal friend.</p>
<p>The fact that she wasn&#8217;t photographed coming and going from clubs on regular basis like so many of her contemporaries meant that her death from substance abuse came as a complete shock to many.</p>

<p>“A bright light that lit the world is forever dimmed, but will live on in the hearts of those that Brittany touched,&#8221; said Murphy&#8217;s family in a statement issued the day of her passing.</p>
<p>“Brittany has been living life on the edge. She definitely had a drug problem and we have all begged her to seek help,” an insider told UK tabloid The Sun that same week.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, friends and family members urged investigators to treat Brittany&#8217;s passing as a homicide.</p>

<p>As recently as 2019, Murphy’s half-brother, Tony Bertolotti, has said he believes Monjack was allegedly responsible for her death.</p>
<p>“I spent years looking at this, suppressing my own anger. I think Brittany was taken out,” he said.</p>
<p>“Who killed Brittany? She didn’t die of natural causes.”</p>

<p>While the documentary will explore the various theories surrounding Murphy&#8217;s death, director Cynthia Hill says this will not be a salacious work of tabloid journalism.</p>
<p>“I agreed to do this film because I think it’s a shame that Brittany’s promising life and career has been eclipsed by the circumstances of her death,” Hill said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important to celebrate Brittany’s talent as we struggle to explain the tragic circumstances of her and Simon’s deaths.</p>
<p>No release date has been set for the project, which is set to debut on HBO Max sometime this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Kylie Jenner (the OG Lipmaster) to Farrah Abraham, check out 19 celebrities who completely destroyed their mouths with some kind of &#8230;  </p><p>Needle. With a needle, friends. They destroyed their mouths with needles, and nothing else, okay? </p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Farrah Abraham</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">1</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Farrah Abraham claimed that she was &#8220;allergic&#8221; to a fake lip implant, which rendered her face to resemble that of Futurama&#8217;s Leela. She looked like hell, yadda yadda yadda, you know what we&#8217;re allergic to? BS. We&#8217;re allergic to BS, Farrah, so quit sticking your lips &#8211; and other things &#8211; in it. </p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Kylie Jenner</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">2</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Yes, in 2016 Kylie Jenner&#8217;s lips hit peak huge. If they got any bigger, she&#8217;d be using a straw to drink all of her meals. Which, come to think of it, appears to be what she&#8217;s doing now, since the only opening in her mouth, unless she goes deep and wide, is a straw-sized hole in the place where the lip skin is about to split &#8230; Actually, is that her tongue, or is it a third lip? </p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Snooki</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">3</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Snooki, Jersey Shore&#8217;s favorite hometown meatball, looks like she&#8217;s been rolling her lips into tiny little balls, like she would a meatball. Since becoming a mom, and going overboard with the &#8220;Mommy Makeover&#8221; that&#8217;s so vapidly popular, Snooki&#8217;s done everything: her teeth, which are actually a plus these days, her boobs, which look fake AF, and her lips &#8230; which are some of the most deformed we&#8217;ve seen on a celebrity in a long time. No, girl, no. </p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Aubrey O&#8217;Day</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">4</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>We all know who Aubrey O&#8217;Day is, right? No? Whatever. Look at those lips. They look like they should be stuck to someone&#8217;s backside, and we don&#8217;t mean the old &#8220;kissing one&#8217;s ass&#8221; phrase, either. This is a hellacious look, and Aubrey would be well-advised to drop the needle before it affects the rest of her head. </p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Kesha</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">5</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Kesha&#8217;s body isn&#8217;t the only thing that put on some weight over the years (and in her body&#8217;s case, much-needed weight; girl was looking waif-thin for awhile there, heaven help her) &#8211; her lips have seemed to triple in size, and in fact, they&#8217;re so big they&#8217;re bumpy. There are literal bumps on her lips from whatever she decided to do. </p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Lindsay Lohan</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">6</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Sorry, Lindsay, but thin is in when it comes to lips. Sorry you&#8217;re so late to the party on this one, because for the longest time, you had such lovely, wry, thin lips, and now you have fish asses on your face. Lip number one looks like a fish ass, and &#8211; oop! &#8211; lip number two looks like a fish ass. Never saw a fish ass before? Just look at Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s mouth. It&#8217;s like &#8220;Where&#8217;s Waldo?&#8221; just for fish asses. </p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Donatella Versace</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">7</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1704" data-id="244727" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-scaled.jpg" alt="Donatella Versace" class="wp-image-244727" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-735x489.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-520x346.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-640x426.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/donatella-versace-1080x719.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></div><p>Donnatella Versace looks like the missing link.

I went back and watched some of her early work and it reignited my fascination with her.</p><p>&#8220;Over the years I always wanted to put pen to paper and celebrate her life in some way and this led to the book.&#8221;</p><p><strong>THG:</strong> What’s the number one thing you&#8217;d like people to know about Ms. Murphy&#8217;s life and her final days?</p><p><strong>Hammond:</strong> &#8220;I guess I’d like people to know that above anything else she was a huge ball of talent and if you eradicate some of her final films she was a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>&#8220;The girl had some serious talent and it’s just sad that due to certain behavior and choices she made in her later years people have forgotten that.</p><p>&#8220;She wasn’t in a good place and she really needed someone to take her under there wing and say, &#8216;Hey, you need to cut your ties with Monjack, ditch your mom and hire a decent agent and press team.&#8217;</p><p>&#8220;Murphy had the talent and she just needed a new support network to bring her head above water and away from the piranhas. I believe she would still be here today if that had happened.</p><p><strong>THG:</strong> You open the book with a reminder of how far Murphy’s star had fallen at the time of her passing. How big of a role do you think her declining popularity played in her death?</p><p><strong>Hammond: &#8220;</strong>I don’t think her career played any part in her physical death. Her career didn’t kill her or allow her to become unresponsive before anyone dialed 911.</p><p>&#8220;Her career was dried up but she wasn’t. We have all seen stars who have hit rock bottom; Natasha Lyonne for example, but she’s back on top and has a healthy output of movies.</p><p>&#8220;America loves a comeback star and I believe with a bit of hard work and some damage control Brittany could have been Hollywood’s golden girl again.</p><p>&#8220;You only have to see Across the Hall, what a fantastic movie and what a great performance she turns in. She still had it in her.&#8221;</p><p><strong>THG:</strong> You’re critical of the way Murphy’s murder was handled by the press. Do you think tabloid culture has gotten better or worse in the years since her passing?</p><p><strong>Hammond:</strong> &#8220;I wouldn’t say I was critical, more realistic. It played a part in her career decline and no sooner she was in the ground she had been forgotten, which I found very sad.</p><p>&#8220;However, I understand it’s the industry, and journalists nowadays have more than one person to compete with to get their pay check.</p><p>&#8220;I don’t think the press industry has changed, so to speak. I feel the stories are more ‘out there’ but then the stars are doing more bizarre things so they stay in the headlines for longer.</p><p>&#8220;Out of sight, out of mind as they say, and I highlight that in my book &#8230; We are in a disposable age.&#8221; </p><p><em>A Case For Murder: Brittany Murphy Files</em> is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Murder-Brittany-Murphy-Files-ebook/dp/B01H46DFRW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467393518&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=a+case+for+murder#navbar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available now</a> on Amazon and other retailers.</p><div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/remembering-brittany-murphy-1977-2009/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="The Hollywood Gossip" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg 500w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-480x480.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-320x320.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-200x200.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-335x335.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-347x347.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></div><h2 class="block-title">Remembering Brittany Murphy (1977-2009)</h2></div></a><div class="block-data"><div class="block-button"><a class="btn" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/remembering-brittany-murphy-1977-2009/"><span>VIEW GALLERY</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="arrow-right" width="32px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 32 12"><g transform="translate(0,12) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill="#000000" stroke="none"><path d="M240 60 l0 -61 35 27 c19 14 35 30 35 34 0 4 -16 20 -35 34 l-35 27 0 -61z"/><path d="M4 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M84 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M164 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/07/was-brittany-murphy-murdered-author-of-shocking-new-tell-all-tal/">Was Brittany Murphy Murdered?
