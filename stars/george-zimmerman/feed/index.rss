										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>In February of 2012, <a href="/2016/05/george-zimmerman-sells-gun-used-to-kill-trayvon-martin-for-disgu/">George Zimmerman murdered Trayvon Martin</a> and got away with it because America being supremely f&#8211;ked with regard to all matters pertaining to race is not something that just started with the ascendancy of the MAGA chuds.</p>

<p>In fact, widespread violent bigotry has pretty much been an inescapable part of life in this country since around the time Columbus hauled ass back to Europe with news of people who were prime for a good oppressin&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the years since he ended the life of a 17-year-old boy walking home to his father&#8217;s house with Skittles and iced tea, Zimmerman has continued to make headlines.</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s proven time and again that he&#8217;s one of the very worst humans walking the planet.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/01/george-zimmerman-arrested-for-hucking-wine-bottle-at-girlfriend/">Zimmerman has been arrested</a> multiple times in recent years, and not for minor offenses.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Saying this guy is bad news would be the understatement of all time.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been charged with brutally beating his fiancee and nearly killing a man in a road rage incident.</p>
<p>So in case prosecutors hadn&#8217;t made it clear enough that Zimmerman is a violent psychopath during his murder trial, the man&#8217;s been doing a fine job of proving that in the years since.</p>
<p>Thankfully, many in positions of power and influence have gone to great lengths to honor Martin&#8217;s memory and keep the teen&#8217;s legacy alive in the years since his passing. </p>

<p>An acclaimed docuseries entitled <em>Rest In Power: The Trayvon Martin Story</em> is currently airing on the Paramount Network.</p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s parents are credited as producers, as a are Jay Z and Beyonce.</p>
<p>In emails and text messages first obtained by The Blast late last year, <a href="/2017/12/george-zimmerman-ill-kill-jay-z-and-feed-him-to-an-alligator/">Zimmerman attacks the Carters</a> in a profane tirade, at one point threatening to feed Jay to a &#8220;13 foot gator.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how to handle people who f&#8211;k with me, I have since February 2012,&#8221; he tells Dennis Warren, a private investigator who has been working on the Martin case for several years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone who f&#8211;ks with my parents will be fed to an alligator,&#8221; Zimmerman adds.</p>
<p>Now, new details of Zimmerman&#8217;s tirade are being revealed in the documentary, and they paint a picture of a deeply disturbed and violent man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yea and tell Jay-Z he’s a bitch and his wife’s a broke whore,&#8221; reads one of Zimmerman&#8217;s messages to Warren.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m bringing hell with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In May, Zimmerman was charged with stalking and harassing Warren after it was revealed that he contacted the PI more than 150 times in the span of a single week. </p>
<p>For their part, Jay Z and Beyonce have yet to take legal action.</p>
<p>However, Jay recently responded in his own way with a recently-released DJ Khaled track on which he has a guest verse:</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile Georgie Porgie sinnin’ and sendin’ me threats,&#8221; he raps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save your breath, you couldn’t beat a flight of steps. Try that shit with a grown man. I’ll kill that f***boy with my own hand.”</p>
<p>As for Beyonce, we&#8217;re hoping she&#8217;ll just hang back and let the Beyhive take care of this fool for her.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Since being acquitted in his murder trial after killing Martin &#8211; he claimed self-defense &#8211; Zimmerman has run afoul of the law on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been questioned by police in two prior domestic altercations, with his then-wife Shellie Zimmerman, and with then-girlfriend <a href="/stars/samantha-scheibe/">Samantha Scheibe</a>.</p>
<p>According to a police report, this alleged domestic incident went down January 5 when Zimmerman and the woman were arguing over one of his paintings.</p>
<p>Oh yes, <a href="/2014/01/george-zimmerman-unveils-latest-painting-rips-trayvon-martin-pro/">George Zimmerman is a painter now</a>.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials say the girlfriend became upset at him over a work of art that he wanted back, and then George tossed the bottle at her.</p>
<p>He missed, hitting his garage door instead.</p>
<p>Police questioned Zimmerman about the fight on January 9, at which point <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2015/01/12/george-zimmerman-arrest-girlfriend-fight-painting-artwork/">he claimed that she threw the bottle</a>. Suffice it to say, cops weren&#8217;t buying it.</p>
<p>They arrested him for aggravated assault.</p>
<p>TMZ reports that the unnamed woman has been dating him for a few months. How seriously? She used to &quot;get drunk in the past and have sex with him before.&quot;</p>
<p>True love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>George Zimmerman had yet another brush with the law this week after he allegedly threatened to kill a man following a road rage incident. Seriously.</p>
<p>WSVN reports that the altercation took place in Lake Mary, Florida.</p>
<p>The man, whose name has not been reported by local media, also told the police that Trayvon Martin&#8217;s killer was waiting for him at his work afterward.</p>

<p>Zimmerman reportedly admitted to police that he had an altercation with the man, but won&#8217;t face any legal action, as the man has declined to press charges.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old, acquitted in the Martin case last July, has avoided protracted legal battles two other times in the past year for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>In December, Zimmerman&#8217;s girlfriend <a href="/2013/11/samantha-scheibe-george-zimmerman-pointed-a-shotgun-at-me-911-ca/">Samantha Scheibe</a> declined to press charges after initially claiming he pointed a shotgun at her face during an argument.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Last September, George&#8217;s ex-wife <a href="/2013/09/shellie-zimmerman-george-zimmerman-wife-files-for-divorce/">Shellie Zimmerman</a> declined to proceed with a case against him after she claimed he threatened her and her father with a gun.</p>
<p>A previous report on this week&#8217;s alleged road rage suggested that Zimmerman was working as a security guard at the time of the confrontation.</p>
<p>The business at which he claimed to be working at the time <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/george-zimmerman-road-rage-threat_n_5811944.html">denied that George was an employee</a> there; that reference has been removed from the story.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/george-zimmerman-celebrity-boxing-star"></a></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dmx-mug-shots-the-epic-gallery"></a></figure></p>
<p>Damon Feldman announced the fight&#8217;s cancelation on Twitter on Saturday and apologized for offending anyone with this proposed clash of titans.</p>
<p>&quot;The George Zimmerman fight is canceled,&quot; he wrote, adding &quot;I&#8217;m sorry for anyone I hurt with this but this was a very big opportunity thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Feldman said there&#8217;s &quot;more to life then money&quot; and that he &quot;just looked at my son and daughter today wow I&#8217;m so lucky those people must be in so much pain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All you people are right.&quot;</p>
<p>Give the guy credit for his conscience kicking in and pulling the plug on the <a href="/2014/02/george-zimmerman-dmx-to-fight-in-celebrity-boxing-this-is-really/">Zimmerman-DMX fight</a> &#8230; but &quot;those people&quot; was probably not the best word choice.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>In any case, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/02/08/george-zimmerman-fight-celebrity-boxing-cancelled-dmx/">Feldman called it off</a>, putting an end to the shameless effort by Zimmerman to cash in on his quasi-celeb status before it even began.</p>
<p>Zimmerman, of course, was found not guilty in July 2013 for the infamous, fatal 2012 shooting of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p>
<p>George wanted to fight Kanye in Celebrity Boxing but settled for DMX, one of thousands of people to show serious interest in getting in the ring with him.</p>
<p>DMX vowed to <a href="/2014/02/george-zimmerman-joins-celebrity-boxing-circuit-dmx-vows-to-beat/">beat the f&#8211;k out of George</a>, then urinate on his face, but looks like he will no longer get the chance to do as he boasted he would. Sigh.</p>
<p>A rep for the rapper said Saturday:</p>
<p>&quot;We thank you for all of the support from DMX&#8217;s fans. This situation will not affect any of DMX&#8217;s upcoming concerts in America or around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Probably just as well.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at 21 epic celebrity fights that weren&#8217;t sanctioned by a Celebrity Boxing promoter and will never be canceled, thanks to the glorious Internet:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>DMX&#8217;s wish has been granted. No, he will not have his mile-long criminal record expunged, nor will he return to his late &#8217;90s, Ruff Ryders rap glory.</p>
<p>He will, however, get to fight George Zimmerman in Celebrity Boxing!</p>
<p>The rapper has officially been named as Zimmerman&#8217;s opponent in his upcoming match, Celebrity Boxing promoter Damon Feldman confirms.</p>
<p><em>Stop &#8230; drop &#8230; shut &#8217;em down open up shop &#8230; Ohhhh!</em></p>

<p>Over 15,000 applicants expressed interest in battling Zimmerman once his interest in the boxing match was publicized. X was the fighter selected.</p>
<p>The trash talk began before he was even picked. <a href="/2014/02/george-zimmerman-joins-celebrity-boxing-circuit-dmx-vows-to-beat/">DMX will beat the f&#8211;k out of Zimmerman</a>, pull out his member and urinate on him after it&#8217;s over, he boasts.</p>
<p>All we have to say to that is &#8230; can we get this on pay-per-view?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I am breaking every rule in boxing to make sure I f&#8211;k him right up,&#8221; <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/02/04/george-zimmerman-boxing-match-dmx/">X told TMZ</a>, adding matter-of-factly that he will literally piss on George&#8217;s face too.</p>
<p>For his part, Trayvon Martin killer <a href="/2014/02/george-zimmerman-to-kanye-west-i-will-kick-your-a/">George wanted to fight Kanye</a> West, given the rapper&#8217;s penchant for attacking innocent people. Irony noted.</p>
<p>Instead, he gets DMX, and in addition to his age advantage (30 vs. 43), Zimmerman has been training hard for months in preparation for the bout.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less clear what X does nowadays besides get arrested.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/george-zimmerman-celebrity-boxing-star"></a></figure>
<p>The boxing match will be three rounds, with the official date, time, and location of the fight to be announced at a big news conference next week.</p>
<p>How do you like his chances? Comment/vote below &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Who will win this Celebrity Boxing matchup?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Celebrity boxing star in training George Zimmerman says he wants to fight Kanye West, because the volatile rapper has a history of attacking defenseless people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not ironic at all coming from Zimmerman.</p>

<p>Promoters for George&#8217;s upcoming celebrity boxing match have received a lot of interest from a lot of stars. <a href="/2014/02/george-zimmerman-joins-celebrity-boxing-circuit-dmx-vows-to-beat/">DMX wants to beat the f&#8211;k out of Zimmerman</a>.</p>
<p>George&#8217;s dream opponent, however, would be &#8216;Ye.</p>
<p>The promoters would make it happen if they could, knowing for many it will become a choice between two evils and a must-see event for the ages.</p>
<p>Mr. <a href="/stars/kim-kardashian.html">Kim Kardashian</a> would never stoop to that level, of course, but it&#8217;s fun to imagine the spectacle that would ensue if he somehow agreed to this.</p>
<p>Zimmerman says he <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/02/03/george-zimmerman-kanye-west-celeb-boxing-defenseless-people/">wants a piece of the rapper</a> because of his attacks on innocent people, such as the 18-year-old who allegedly called Kim a &#8220;n&#8211;ger lover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard to say how to handicap this hypothetical bout.</p>
<p>Kanye has a long history of violent altercations and is never afraid to throw down, while Zimmerman once shot an unarmed teenager to death.</p>
<p>The promoters say they&#8217;re willing to move the fight to L.A. to accommodate Kanye if he&#8217;s interested. Which he won&#8217;t be, but we gotta ask anyway:</p>
<p><strong>Who would you root for in this fight?</strong></p>
