<p>Patrick Mahomes has had no trouble dismantling opposing defenses as he led the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-skips-yet-another-chiefs-game-following-birthday-celebration-with-travis-kelce/">Kansas City Chiefs</a> to their third straight Super Bowl. But he might find that recent divorce rumors are not as easy to overcome.</p>



<p>Why all the sudden speculation about trouble within <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/does-patrick-mahomes-more-kids-baby-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick&#8217;s marriage to Brittany Mahomes</a>?</p>



<p>Well, the source seems to be a series of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Mahomes-wife-says-no-resting-b-face?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok videos</a> documenting an awkward moment for the couple.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-1024x683.jpg" alt="Brittany Mahomes and Patrick Mahomes attend the Los Angeles Premiere Of Netflix's &quot;Quarterback&quot; at TUDUM Theater on July 11, 2023 in Hollywood, California. " class="wp-image-508688" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1535379388-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brittany Mahomes and Patrick Mahomes attend the Los Angeles Premiere Of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Quarterback&#8221; at TUDUM Theater on July 11, 2023 in Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/patrick-and-brittany-mahomes-welcome-third-child-reveal-colorful-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick and Brittany just welcomed their third child</a>, and there&#8217;s no reason to believe that they&#8217;re having any sort of marital issues. But that won&#8217;t stop desperate influencers from claiming otherwise!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-patrick-mahomes-divorce-rumors-how-did-they-start">Patrick Mahomes Divorce Rumors: How Did They Start?</h2>



<p>In the TikTok clips, Patrick and Brittany can be seen sitting courtside at a college basketball game.</p>



<p>Brittany turns to a friend and says, &#8220;Patrick told me no resting b-tch face.&#8221; She then sarcastically smiles to demonstrate that she&#8217;s following his orders.</p>



<p>It was a slightly tense moment in what otherwise appears to be a healthy, stable marriage.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-683x1024.jpg" alt="Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany walking the red carpet at the Kansas City Chiefs ring ceremony at Union Station on June 15, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri." class="wp-image-508686" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1498859259-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany walking the red carpet at the Kansas City Chiefs ring ceremony at Union Station on June 15, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Hanna/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But it was enough to get the rumor mill churning. And now, countless social media users are convinced that the couple is ready to call it quits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-patrick-and-brittany-have-been-battling-rumors-for-years">Patrick and Brittany Have Been Battling Rumors For Years</h2>



<p>Patrick and Brittany married in 2022, and the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-separated-over-his-refusal-to-retire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce speculation</a> began almost immediately.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1968598248-1024x683.jpg" alt="Patrick Mahomes #15 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with his wife, Brittany, after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on January 28, 2024 in Baltimore, Maryland.

<p>One memorable incident <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-news-nfl-fans-ignore-divorce-as-wife-brittany-and-husband-patrick-mahomes-celebrate-arrowhead-reunion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompted Brittany to clap back</a> against famed podcast host Joe Rogan.</p>



<p>&#8220;Patrick Mahomes has a wife that’s just wild. She’s up in the box and films herself. And Patrick is obviously the man, and then he’s got a crazy wife and a brother up in the box, doing all that s&#8211;t,&#8221; comedian Shane Gillis remarked on Rogan&#8217;s show.</p>



<p>“Oh Jesus. The problem is, they keep that same energy when you get divorced. They come after you with that same energy,” Rogan replied.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="709" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2150314317-1-1024x709.jpg" alt="Brittany Mahomes and Patrick Mahomes attend the 2024 TIME100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 25, 2024 in New York City.

<p>“Something about grown men talking s&#8211;t about someone’s wife is real weird,” Brittany tweeted in response, adding:</p>



<p> “Actually grown ass men hating on women in general is pathetic.“</p>



<p>Brittany never addressed Rogan and Gillis by name. But it was pretty obvious that they were the targets of her tweet.</p>

<p>These days, Brittany appears to be loving life as a mother of three.</p>



<p>And while her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/brittany-mahomes-trump-support-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">friendship with Taylor Swift </a>may have experienced some strain during election season, it seems that Brittany&#8217;s marriage is still going strong.</p>



<p>Now, Brit is once again gearing up to cheer on the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.</p>



<p>Yes, Pat could welcome his third kid and earn a third ring in the same year. Exciting times for the Mahomes clan!</p>

<p>As previously speculated, Brittany Mahomes may or may not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/patrick-mahomes-divorce/">file to divorce Patrick Mahomes</a> someday.</p>



<p>But regardless of where she stands with the universe&#8217;s best quarterback, a new report says Brittany is having serious second thoughts about her connection to Donald Trump.</p>



<p>As you may have heard <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/brittany-mahomes-trump-support-taylor-swift/">Mahomes is on Team MAGA</a>.</p>



<p>She has made this clear via numerous social media posts.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509483" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2170852670.jpg 1448w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce and Brittany Mahomes attend the Men&#8217;s Singles Final match between Taylor Fritz of the United States and Jannik Sinner of Italy on Day Fourteen of the 2024 US Open at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 8, 2024 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-says-shes-choosing-calm-over-chaos/">Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for President</a>, Trump reacted in his typically fair and reserved fashion.</p>



<p>He said Swift would &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-says-taylor-swift-will-pay-a-price-for-kamala-harris-endorsement/">pay a price</a>&#8221; for this decision and later wrote online, all-capital letters, &#8220;I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a response very much befitting of someone running for the highest office in the land.</p>

<p>Now, according to The Daily Mail, Mahomes is &#8220;questioning her support for Donald Trump&#8221; after this rant, considering how close Brittany has grown to Taylor in the wake of her long-term relationship with Travis Kelce.</p>



<p>The two are often seen hugging and hanging out in a luxury suite while watching the Kansas City Chiefs play professional football.</p>



<p>&#8220;This deeply bothered Brittany because Taylor is like a sister to her and she has done absolutely nothing wrong,&#8221; a source told the aforementioned newspaper, citing Swift&#8217;s support of Harris and adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t mention Trump in her post and is allowed to speak her mind.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-682x1024.jpg" alt="Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes" class="wp-image-509488" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2153312142-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes attend the 2024 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue launch party at Hard Rock Cafe &#8211; Times Square on May 16, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A reasonable person might agree with this.</p>



<p>But few observers consider Donald Trump to be reasonable.</p>



<p>&#8220;She does not believe in hate in any form and loves Taylor so much. This shook her to the core,&#8221; the insider continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t mean she is suddenly voting Kamala. It has just made her more aware of supporting [Trump] so publicly.&#8221;</p>

<p>In August, Mahomes Liked a Trump social media that delved into some of his policies on topics ranging from immigration to the economy.</p>



<p>After garnering a great deal of backlash for doing so, Brittany fired back at her critics as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult you have to have some deep rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There&#8217;s no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A public threat suggested a murder plot against Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes.</p>



<p>Fortunately, both athletes are alive and well.</p>



<p>Authorities arrested a man who threatened to shoot both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/travis-kelce-hits-woman-golf-ball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">football players</a> at a Morgan Wallen concert.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this was a substantive threat or a horrific (but thankfully empty) prank.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce at the White House in May of 2024." class="wp-image-506277" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce appear at an event with U.S. President Joe Biden on the South Lawn of the White House on May 31, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-all-starts-with-a-morgan-wallen-tour">It all starts with a Morgan Wallen tour</h2>



<p>Morgan Wallen is currently on his One Night At A Time World Tour. He performed at Arrowhead Stadium, which just happens to be the field of the current Super Bowl champions: the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>



<p>(This story is unlikely to change your opinion of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/morgan-wallen-face-thong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morgan Wallen concert attendees</a>.)</p>



<p>According to court documents, an analyst who monitors public social media posts for potential threats at the concert noticed a tweet. The tweet made what appeared to be a terrorist threat &#8212; a murder plot surrounding Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Patrick Mahomes and Traivs Kelce in February of 2024." class="wp-image-506278" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patrick Mahomes #15 and Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs react before Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Michael Reaves/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The offending tweet no longer appears to be on Twitter. However, court documents reveal its contents, according to <em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/04/arrest-man-morgan-wallen-concert-threatened-shoot-patrick-mahomes-travis-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ </a></em>and other reports.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. [redacted] at Arrowhead with the wife. If he brings out [redacted] or [redacted] I&#8217;ll take the f&#8212;in shot. F&#8212; em! Also f&#8212; you b&#8212;-!!&#8221; court documents describe the tweet, which went up shortly before the concert, as saying.</p>



<p>Those sound like explicit threats and part of a murder plot. Not a very <em>smart </em>plot, but many of history&#8217;s most sinister schemes have been ill-advised.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-authorities-made-an-arrest-in-the-alleged-murder-plot">Authorities made an arrest in the alleged murder plot</h2>



<p>Police arrested 23-year-old Aaron Brown. The Winchester, Illinois native now faces Class E felony charges of Making a Terrorist Threat in the 2nd Degree. His bail is $15,000.</p>



<p>According to reports, authorities identified Brown as the user, &#8220;Gooey Bag,&#8221; behind the tweet. He was apparently in the stadium when police contacted him.</p>



<p>And, sure enough, Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes were <a href="https://x.com/Schultz_Report/status/1819567942557667746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there</a> at Arrowhead Stadium.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Social media&#8217;s ability to allow people to impulsively <em>yeet </em>their thoughts out into the world has numerous downsides. Sometimes, this means legal trouble.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a stupid, stupid, stupid mistake,&#8221; Aaron Brown said of the tweet that described a murder plot against Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes.</p>



<p>He was, according to court documents, &#8220;freaked out&#8221; that his alarming tweet had made its way to authorities.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes at a sports game in May of 2024." class="wp-image-506280" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0805_traviskelce_patrickmahomes_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs look on during the fourth quarter of Game Three of the Western Conference Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Minnesota Timberwolves at American Airlines Center on May 26, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Cooper Neill/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thankfully-travis-kelce-and-patrick-mahomes-are-well">Thankfully, Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are well</h2>



<p>If they were ever in any danger, it appears that authorities thwarted it. And many on social media are now concluding that the murder plot was insincere. Hostile, but insincere.</p>



<p>However, making a terrorist threat &#8220;in jest&#8221; is indistinguishable on social media from an actual murder plot. There are people who try to kill celebrities. There are people who aim to harm people at crowded events.</p>



<p>It is truly best to reign in your worst impulses. One unwise social media post can upend your entire life.</p>
