<p>Meghan Markle has released the first episode of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-podcast-trailer-released-lets-do-this-ladies/">her new podcast</a>, opening up on the platform about something very personal and very painful.</p>



<p>Talking to Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, the Duchess of Sussex revealed that both she and her guest experienced postpartum preeclampsia&#8230; a unique and potentially life-threatening condition marked by high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine shortly after giving birth.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522948" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex pose for a photo at Centro Nacional de las Artes Delia Zapata during a visit to Colombia on August 15, 2024 in Bogota, Colombia. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Diego Cuevas/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We both had very similar experiences — though we didn&#8217;t know each other at the time — with postpartum, and we both had preeclampsia. Postpartum preeclampsia,&#8221; Markle said on air.</p>



<p>The former actress has two kids with Prince Harry: son, Prince Archie, 5; and daughter, Princess Lilibet, 3.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when the aforementioned condition hit her.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s so rare and so scary,&#8221; Markle continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re still trying to juggle all of these things, and the world doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening quietly. And in the quiet, you&#8217;re still trying to show up for people – mostly for your children — but those things are huge medical scares.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle isn&#8217;t receiving rave reviews for her Netflix series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Wolfe Herd agreed, saying the condition is &#8220;life or death, truly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Markle talked about the Royal Family tradition of introducing a newborn to the world pretty much immediately; just as Princess Diana and Kate Middleton did previously, Markle stood outside with two-day old Archie back in May 2019.</p>



<p>In front of the media and millions watching around the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could barely face a doorbell delivery for takeout food in a robe,&#8221; Wolfe Herd said, prompting a laugh from Meghan.</p>

<p>Markle is a busy woman these days, hosting this new podcast and also a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/">Netflix show everyone hates</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I do love the most about having young kids, in this chapter while I&#8217;m building [business], is the perspective that it brings because you&#8217;re building something while your child&#8217;s going through potty training…and both are just as important,&#8221; she said on this episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like, ‘Great, okay, where&#8217;s the Cheerios? Well done.’</p>



<p>&#8220;And then you&#8217;re championing your team 10 minutes later about something that is really high value for the world. In your own world, that&#8217;s super high value. And in [Lili’s] world, that&#8217;s super high value.&#8221;</p>



<p>Markle has often been accused of acting and sound unrelatable. But plenty of women are likely nodding their heads to this description of how life can be.</p>

<p>Markle and Lemonada Media announced on March 13 that her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, would focus on her entrepreneurial journey launching the As ever lifestyle brand (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-finally-launches-as-ever-entire-inventory-sells-out-immediately/">which sold out its first batch</a> of products last week) and feature honest conversations with fellow female founders over eight installments.</p>



<p>Wrote the polarizing star via Instagram at the time:</p>



<p><em>I’ve been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities, and scaled small ideas into massively successful businesses. They’re opening up, sharing their tips, tricks (and tumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build out my own business, As ever. I</em></p>



<p><em>t has been absolutely eye-opening, inspiring…and fun! (Because what’s the point if we can’t have some fun on this wild adventure?)</em></p>

<p>Meghan Markle is forging ahead.</p>



<p>Critics be damned.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard, Markle is starring in a Netflix series that most <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-netflix-show-is-awful-should-end-the-career-of-thirsty-star-review/">viewers believe to be truly awful</a>.</p>



<p>The former actress, and wife of Prince Harry, seems intent on rebuilding her reputation/changing the narrative/making lots of money, however&#8230; because she isn&#8217;t done relaunching her entertainment career.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522033" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2166613456-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle during her participation in the Afro Women and Power Forum at the Municipal Theater of Cali during a visit around Colombia on August 18, 2024 in Cali, Colombia. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Gabriel Aponte/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/">Markle is coming out with a podcast</a>.</p>



<p>The Duchess of Sussex and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-called-out-by-clothing-designer-over-as-ever-brand-name/">As Ever founder</a> has teamed up with Lemonada Media for her latest foray into podcasting &#8212; and People Magazine has released the first trailer for this project.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Meghan, and this is <em>Confessions of a Female Founder</em>, a show where I chat with female entrepreneurs and friends about the sleepless nights, the lessons learned and the laser focus that got them to where they are today,&#8221; Markle says in the preview, which was released on March 25.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re diving into the highs — and the lows – and the kind of advice that turns small ideas into billion-dollar businesses. And of course, we&#8217;re going to get some girl talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>The snippet was interspersed with audio from the show, <a href="https://people.com/meghan-markle-new-podcast-trailer-listen-confessions-of-a-female-founder-lemonada-exclusive-11701291">courtesy of People</a>, where various guests speak about their own successes and their own struggles.</p>



<p>&#8220;It just started climbing and climbing, and there was 5,000, 10,000 people on our website,&#8221; one individual shares, while another says on air: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m broke, and no one is calling me.&#8221; </p>



<p>Yet <em>another</em> looks back at the turning point of, &#8220;I knew in that moment that I&#8217;d rather stand for something than sell a whole ton of product and stand for nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain just who any of these guests actually are. Guess we&#8217;ll need to tune in to the podcast to find out.</p>

<p>Markle will go beyond business, too, it seems.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you saying you&#8217;re not single now? Have I missed something in the past couple weeks? What&#8217;s happening?&#8221; Meghan asks one guest, which makes them both laugh.</p>



<p>To wrap up the teaser, Markle says:</p>



<p>&#8220;And through it all, I&#8217;m building a business of my own, and getting all sorts of practical advice along the way that I&#8217;m very excited to share with you. So join me for Confessions of a Female Founder from Lemonada Media, which by the way, is also female-founded. Launching April 8, wherever you get your podcasts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do this, ladies.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle isn&#8217;t receiving rave reviews for her Netflix series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-slammed-as-manipulative-liar-following-st-patricks-day-instagram-post/">Markle isn&#8217;t very popular these days</a>, but she clearly thinks this podcast will show listeners a new and appealing side to her.</p>



<p>At the end of the trailer, the ex-Suits cast member says simply: &#8220;This is not Shark Tank, think of this as &#8216;dolphin tank.&#8217; These are very friendly waters, it&#8217;s all going to be good.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Confessions of a Female Founder</em> will be Markle&#8217;s second-ever pod, as she previously hosted <em>Archetypes</em> on Spotify in 2022.</p>



<p>The show didn&#8217;t last long, but it topped Spotify&#8217;s international charts upon its premiere and somehow went on to win the People’s Choice Award for pop podcast.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, Meghan Markle is starring in a new Netflix series titled &#8220;With Love, Meghan.&#8221;</p>



<p>And in case you also haven&#8217;t heard, the show is not exactly getting met with enthusiastic rounds of applause and/or praise.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-uses-daughter-lilibet-to-promote-netflix-show-cant-do-anything-right/">Markle was accused of exploiting</a> her daughter to market the series.</p>



<p>Then, she garnered some backlash when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-corrects-mindy-kaling-on-how-to-address-her-during-awkward-with-love-meghan-segment/">she corrected Mindy Kaling</a> on her last name, claiming she should know by referred to as Meghan Sussex.</p>

<p>For the most part, viewers have come down hard on Markle for being inauthentic and self-absorbed.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s almost nothing when compared to what Stuart Heritage of The Guardian wrote a few days ago after checking out the program for the first time.</p>



<p>Referring to the overall production deal Markle and husband Prince Harry signed with Netflix, this critic writes:</p>



<p><strong><em>With Love, Meghan doesn’t just represent the hard launch of Duchess of Sussex’s new career as a Martha Stewart-style lifestyle inspo guru; it might also be the final thing she makes for Netflix.</em></strong></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-520760" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/netflix_withlovemeghan_meghanmarkle_mindykaling.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle and Mindy Kaling are friends.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in 2021, the spouses signed a five-year deal with the streaming service worth $100 million, with executives hoping it would lead to one hit show after another.</p>



<p>Instead, last year introduced viewers to Polo, a behind-the-scenes look at a sport not exactly well known or beloved around the world.</p>



<p>Neither Harry nor Meghan appeared on screen.</p>



<p>The show came and went and we bet almost no one reading this at the moment even knew it existed.</p>

<p>Prior to this release, there was 2023’s documentary Heart of Invictus, which also had limited appeal. </p>



<p>Outside the Netflix contract, there was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-ruined-her-spotify-podcast/">Meghan’s bizarre podcast</a>, Archetypes, which ran for 12 episodes in 2022 and was the grand total of the couple’s $20 million Spotify deal.</p>



<p>When it comes to Markle&#8217;s solo series here, Heritage mocks the content for featuring almost nothing but a &#8220;woman filling children’s party bags with seeds and manuka honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continues to trash the former actress by stating:</p>



<p><em><strong>The thirsty part of Meghan still exists.. it’s evident in her decision to rebrand herself in With Love, Meghan. The problem is that nobody wants to see Meghan making decorative ladybird crostini with Mindy Kaling. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>With Love, Meghan is the sort of gormless lifestyle filler that, had it been made by the BBC, would be used to bulk out episodes of Saturday Kitchen</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Previously, Meghan McCain made it clear <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-mccain-i-absolutely-hate-meghan-markle/">how much she hates Meghan Markle</a>.</p>



<p>Five years after ditching The Royal Family, Markle&#8217;s reputation has never been worse.</p>



<p>Writing that Harry and Meghan are most appealing when they&#8217;re &#8220;whining,&#8221; Heritage concludes that they should aim to be reality stars along the lines of those who starred in various MTV shows in the early and mid-2000s.</p>



<p><em><strong>There are rumours that Netflix may not cut its losses with the Sussexes completely, instead preferring to keep them on at a vastly reduced rate. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>This is good news for the content developed but not yet delivered, such as the adaptation of the novel Meet Me at the Lake, and possibly even their aborted animation show, Pearl. But mainly it’s good news for us. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>If this really is the last roll of the dice, then it may be time for Harry and Meghan to face the inevitable and become the new Osbournes.</strong></em></p>

<p>Meghan Markle has once again given the public a glimpse into her private life.</p>



<p>And she&#8217;s once again paying the reputational price for it. </p>



<p>Last month, the former actress offered up a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/princess-lilibet-new-photo-as-ever/">rare photo of daughter Lilibet</a> in order to promote her As Ever brand launch.</p>



<p>(As previously detailed, the mother of two announced via social media recently that she was renaming her lifestyle brand <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-mccain-i-absolutely-hate-meghan-markle/">from American Riviera Orchard to As Ever</a>.)</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 1, meanwhile, Markle uploaded candid photos of three-year Lilibet spending time with her “auntie” Serena Williams at home as they celebrated the upcoming launch of Meghan&#8217;s Netflix series With Love, Meghan.</p>



<p>In a footage shared on Markle&#8217;s Instagram Stories, the toddler was spotted in a precious pink top and floral-printed leggings as she stood next to the tennis legend&#8230; who was clapping&#8230; and the pair seemed to be playing a personalized Candy Land board game on a coffee table.</p>



<p>“When the aunties comes to celebrate … and to play! Love you @serenawilliam,” the ex-Suits cast member wrote in a message over the clip as the song “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers played in the background.</p>



<p>Lilibet appeared alongside Williams in a subsequent post, too, as the adult and child continued to play Candy Land while Markle, dressed in a loose-fitting navy-blue top and pants, looked on.</p>

<p>The adorable nature of this video was overshadowed, according to critics, by the fact that Markle quickly used the lovely moment to promote her aforementioned program.</p>



<p>“3 days until the party begins. All are invited ❤️ @netflix,” she wrote, referring to her upcoming Netflix series, which launches March 4. </p>



<p>Markle concluded the series of posts with a black-and-white photo of her and Serena embracing.</p>



<p>The iconic athlete, for her part reposted the video of her playing with Lilibet, adding “❤️🥰” over the top of it.</p>

<p>Markle has been suffering PR hit after PR hit these days.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been blasted for this ongoing attempt to be a modern day Martha Stewart, while others have come out against Markle for seemingly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-gets-absolutely-blasted-for-alleged-princess-diana-comparison/">comparing herself to Princess Diana</a>.</p>



<p>Many observers are aghast at Meghan&#8217;s sudden reversal, as she formerly maintained the utmost privacy of her kids &#8212; but now seems to be exploiting her daughter for marketing purposes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the bed look.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="699" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-1024x699.jpg" alt="Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan Markle react while attending a show during a visit to the National Centre for the Arts in Bogota on August 15, 2024." class="wp-image-516613" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-768x524.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-2048x1398.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-960x655.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-1080x737.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2166230204-8-1200x819.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan Markle react while attending a show during a visit to the National Centre for the Arts in Bogota on August 15, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by RAUL ARBOLEDA/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I cannot stand her,” Meghan McCain said of Markle on the February 19 episode of Meghan McCain’s Happy Hour digital series.</p>



<p>“I love people that I can relate to, like every other 40-year-old mom. I don’t want to eat her jam. I love Princess Kate [Middleton].&#8221;</p>



<p>Prior to this rant, McCain used Twitter to also trash Markle as follows:</p>



<p>“I was originally a Meghan Markle supporter, I thought she was cool, stylish and refreshing. Like the rest of the world my opinion changed when she disrespected the royal family.</p>



<p>“Now that she wants to be American again instead of British aristocracy what she seems to forget is Americans want real, raw, uncensored. </p>



<p>&#8220;All of this even in the trailer is highly curated, produced and out of touch.”</p>

<p>Meghan Markle could really use a win these days.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the former actress teased an upcoming Netflix series that attempts to paint her as some kind of modern day Martha Stewart.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-unveils-trailer-for-new-netflix-cooking-show-gets-roasted-by-savage-critics/">didn&#8217;t go over very well</a> with the public.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520081" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198277717-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">WHISTLER, CANADA &#8211; FEBRUARY 10: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle deliver remarks at the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 Nation Home Welcome Reception on February 10th, 2025. in Whistler, Canada. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images for Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Markle then renamed and tried to rebrand her company American Riviera Orchard, telling everyone it is now known as As Ever and, well&#8230; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-mccain-i-absolutely-hate-meghan-markle/">Meghan McCain had some very harsh words</a> in response.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile, a large number of social media users are also laying into Prince Harry&#8217;s wife, interpreting a recent social media post as Markle&#8217;s attempt to compare herself to Princess Diana.</p>



<p>Even if there&#8217;s a good chance Markle wasn&#8217;t <em>actually</em> making this comparison. Allow us to explain&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-2048x1370.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-960x642.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1200x803.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, arrives for The Paley Center for Media gala honoring actor and director Tyler Perry, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills on December 4, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT / AFP) (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the last several weeks, Markle has been updating her Instagram page on a semi-frequent basis&#8230; trying to promote the aforementioned Netflix show and just trying to be more of a presence in her followers&#8217; lives.</p>



<p>In a recent upload, Markle is outside in the sunshine, sharing a laugh &#8212; and wearing a purple Northwestern sweatshirt, a piece of attire seemingly identical to one Diana wore way back in 1996.</p>



<p>&#8220;Meghan Markle&#8217;s obsession with copying Diana has gone from desperate to downright creepy,&#8221; wrote one Twitter user after seeing this side-by-side comparison, while another agreed as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;If she put even half the effort she spends on cosplaying Diana into finding her own identity, it would be a miracle.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-2.26.04%E2%80%AFPM-916x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-520086"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though: Markle herself graduated from this university!</p>



<p>She earned a diploma &#8212; with a double major in international studies and theater, no less! &#8212; in 2003 from the well-respected Chicago institution.</p>



<p>So&#8230; could Markle have been paying tribute to her late mother-in-law in some sense? Sure, yes. Maybe. We can&#8217;t say for certain.</p>



<p>But it seems just as likely, if not even <em>more</em> likely, that Markle was simply displaying enthusiasm for a college she attended.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-722x1024.jpg" alt="Meghan Markle speaks during the 'Responsible Digital Future' forum in Bogota on August 15, 2024." class="wp-image-513843" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-722x1024.jpg 722w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-211x300.jpg 211w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-768x1089.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-1444x2048.jpg 1444w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-677x960.jpg 677w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-761x1080.jpg 761w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-846x1200.jpg 846w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2166238792-1-scaled.jpg 1805w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle speaks during the &#8216;Responsible Digital Future&#8217; forum in Bogota on August 15, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by RAUL ARBOLEDA/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The unfortunate truth, and the real point here in our opinion, is that Markle has clearly lost any benefit of any doubt with most observers.</p>



<p>She and Harry left the Royal Family five years ago at this point and most folks didn&#8217;t blame them for doing so; those people are rich, entitled and very likely racist.</p>



<p>Since that time, however, the spouses have been flailing &#8212; both for attention and for money.</p>



<p>They tried and failed to host a successful podcast. Harry got dragged for what many people believed to be a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/">self-serving autobiography</a>. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-dropped-by-agency/">Markle allegedly got dropped</a> by her talent agency.</p>



<p>Very little has gone right for the couple of late, culminating in the above apparent scandal: Meghan Markle cannot even support her alma mater without getting grief from complete strangers.</p>

<p>Have Meghan Markle and Prince Harry been snubbed by the Clooneys?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-tailor-comes-forward-with-final-word-on-infamous-wedding-dress-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry&#8217;s 2018 wedding</a> was the social event of the year, with A-list stars and dignitaries from across the globe in attendance.</p>



<p>Among the celebrities on hand were George and Amal Clooney, who had developed a close friendship with the Sussexes in the months after they announced their engagement.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the two couples have drifted apart in recent years.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the fact that they now live on separate continents, or maybe there was some sort of secret falling out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-vs-the-clooneys">Harry and Meghan vs. the Clooneys</h2>



<p>For unknown reasons, the Clooneys allegedly failed to invite Harry and Meghan to the third annual Albie Awards.</p>



<p>The Clooney Foundation for Justice in New York City hosted the star-studded event in September of 2024.</p>



<p>George and Amal left the couple off the guest list despite the fact that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/prince-harry-prince-williams-nyc-run-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry was in Manhattan</a> that week to attend the Clinton Global Initiative Summit. In other words, he easily could&#8217;ve attended.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="787" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1447258326-2-1024x787.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attend the 2022 Robert F.

<p></p>



<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that this was the second straight year the duke and duchess were MIA at the event.</p>



<p>Sources say the Sussexes were stunned when the Clooneys didn&#8217;t invite them to the star-studded soiree in 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-george-and-amal-execute-a-royal-diss">George and Amal Execute a Royal Diss</h2>



<p>&#8220;Of all the snubs they&#8217;ve had to deal with since their move to Hollywood, this is probably the most hurtful [to Harry and Meghan],&#8221; one insider told the <em>National Enquirer</em> (<a href="https://radaronline.com/p/prince-harry-meghan-markle-humiliated-snubbed-george-amal-gala/">via</a> Radar Online). </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-483912" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1678303308-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend the Wheelchair Basketball preliminary match between Ukraine and Australia during day four of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 13, 2023 in Dusseldorf, Germany. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;George and Amal went from being their wedding guests and trusted confidants to totally ghosting them.&#8221;</p>



<p>As an actress, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-was-humiliated-by-spotify-firing-insider-claims/">Meghan likely encountered her fair share of rejection</a>, but this sort of snub is probably new to Harry.</p>



<p>And it seems that the Sussexes are not taking it well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-and-meghan-left-reeling">Harry and Meghan Left Reeling</h2>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge kick in the teeth and a massive embarrassment they can&#8217;t really explain or wrap their heads around,&#8221; the insider added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The gala would have been a dream event for the two, but George and Amal knew only too well the circus that follows them would have ruined it for others.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, the first snub came at a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-is-strategizing-her-hollywood-reinvention-with-a-new-pr-team-is-the-duchess-getting-desperate-for-a-comeback/">Harry and Meghan were attempting to rebuild their public image</a> following a string of bad press.</p>

<p>Being spotted at an A-list charity event would&#8217;ve provided exactly the sort of boost that Harry and Meghan needed to help them reclaim their place at the top of the global celebrity totem pole.</p>



<p>The situation comes as a shock, as the Clooneys previously spoke quite highly of the Sussexes.</p>



<p>&#8220;We live not too far from one another and we have dinners and stuff and we&#8217;re friends with them for all the reasons that you&#8217;re friends with anybody,&#8221; George told the <em>Daily Mail</em> in 2020.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just really nice, fun, kind people, they&#8217;re a very loving couple, and they&#8217;re going to be great parents.&#8221;</p>



<p>We may never know exactly what caused the two couples to drift apart.</p>



<p>But with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/george-clooney-divorce-actor-and-wife-living-separate-lives-source-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce rumors circulating around George and Amal</a>, the Clooneys might have decided to shrink their social circle in an effort to sidestep unnecessary drama.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s possible that as UK residents, George and Amal have decided that their loyalty lies with the Windsors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Attention, Kate Middleton!</p>



<p>Anything you can do, Meghan Markle can do better. And hotter. And with even more intimacy and love and passion.</p>



<p>This is the message we can&#8217;t help but wonder if the former actress is now sending&#8230; considering the just posted a photo on Instagram of her and husband Prince Harry locking lips.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/meghan-markle-prince-harry-021425-d639b8610e254b76a43caccbae2c58a9.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-519294" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/meghan-markle-prince-harry-021425-d639b8610e254b76a43caccbae2c58a9.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/meghan-markle-prince-harry-021425-d639b8610e254b76a43caccbae2c58a9-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day 2025 from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Meghan Markle/Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Markle just happened to do so around the same exact time as Middleton just <em>happened</em> to release a similarly cute/romantic <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-go-full-on-pda-in-rare-valentines-day-photo/">picture of her and husband Prince William</a>.</p>



<p>(Granted, both women also did so around the same exact time as Valentine&#8217;s Day on the calendar. But just go with us here, okay?)</p>



<p>Does this mean Markle is trying to reignite her infamous feud with Middleton?</p>



<p>Last we heard, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-ends-feud-with-meghan-markle-prince-harry/">Middleton had reached out to her one-time enemy</a> amid the devastating Los Angeles wildfires this winter in an attempt to check in on her well-being and perhaps to bury the hatchet.</p>



<p>Now, though? It&#8217;s hard to say whether or not Markle was throwing some shade at the Princess of Wales with this similar snapshot.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-2048x1370.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-960x642.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2187681871-3-1200x803.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, arrives for The Paley Center for Media gala honoring actor and director Tyler Perry, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills on December 4, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT / AFP) (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For her part, Middleton included just a red heart emoji as a caption to the aforementioned photo (below) of her and her spouse.</p>



<p>Again, maybe in an attempt to show Kate up, Meghan took her social media message a lot further.</p>



<p>&#8220;Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine, as he continues on at the Invictus Games, changing lives and reminding all of us of the power of healing and resilience through these incredible veterans and their families. Beyond proud of my husband and what he’s created,&#8221; she wrote, referring to Harry doing some charitable work these days in Canada.</p>



<p>Added Markle:</p>



<p><strong>My love, I will eat burgers &amp; fries and fish &amp; chips with you forever. Thank you for you.</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this week, observers <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-leaves-invictus-games-without-prince-harry-whats-going-on-here/">were wondering just why Markle left</a> the aforementioned Invictus Games without Harry, prompting a new round of romantic speculation about the couple.</p>



<p>The pair <em>did</em> kick off the event together, attending the opening ceremony and numerous events during the first days of the adaptive sporting competition for service personnel and veterans that the Duke of Sussex founded in 2014.</p>



<p>It seemed evident now that Markle just went back to California early to care for the couple&#8217;s two children.</p>



<p>Said Harry to People Magazine during the Invictus Games, making it clear just where things stood between himself and the former Suits cast member: </p>



<p>&#8220;To have my wife here supporting me is amazing. I love that she’s by my side. It’s such an important piece to this whole adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thomas Markle has made quite a few tabloid headlines in recent years.&#8217;</p>



<p>And now, in an ironic twist, the controversial father of Meghan Markle says he&#8217;s moving halfway across the globe in order to escape the &#8220;drama&#8221; in his life.</p>



<p>Yes, the &#8220;drama&#8221; Thomas speaks of is almost entirely self-created, but it seems that he would rather flee the hemisphere than simply stop talking to the press.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thomas-markle-reveals-plans-to-relocate-to-southeast-asia">Thomas Markle Reveals Plans to Relocate to Southeast Asia</h2>



<p>In a new interview (this guy really loves talking to the press), Thomas revealed his plan to abandon his home in Rosarito, Mexico in order to make a &#8220;fresh start.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I am ready for a change,” he told the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-14250231/Meghan-father-America-world-exclusive-interview-Thomas-Markle-grandchildren.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>. “I have felt stuck in a rut for some time and I am ready to meet new people and experience kindness.”</p>



<p>Thomas noted that he has not selected a specific location, but he intends to make his new home in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I traveled in that part of the world when I was a younger man. The people are so kind and welcoming, and they are respectful to older people. It is a place of culture and beauty,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll end up but it is time to move on and find a place where I can live among kind people and enjoy the time I have left.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thomas-strained-relationship-with-meghan">Thomas&#8217; Strained Relationship With Meghan</h2>





<p>There was a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/thomas-markle-to-meghan-let-me-see-my-grandchildren-before-i-die-dont-make-me-take-you-to-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas would publicly beg Meghan</a> to introduce him to his grandchildren. But it seems he&#8217;s now come to terms with the fact that his estrangement with his daughter will not be coming to an end anytime soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly I just want peace. At 80, none of us know how long we have left,&#8221; he explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want whatever time I have to be peaceful with none of the awful drama of recent years.&#8221;</p>



<p>The <em>Mail</em> notes that Meghan and husband Prince Harry have never visited Thomas in Rosarito.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not terribly surprising, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/thomas-markle-blasts-meghan-and-ginger-husband-harry-i-cant-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas has made a career of bashing Meghan</a> in the press.</p>



<p>Along with his other daughter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/07/samantha-markle-to-half-sister-youre-basically-killing-our-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samantha Markle</a>, Thomas has given numerous interviews in which he&#8217;s accused Meghan of destroying her own family.</p>



<p>So Meg&#8217;s probably not terribly heartbroken by the news that her dad will soon be living very far away.</p>

<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-unveils-trailer-for-new-netflix-cooking-show-gets-roasted-by-savage-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle released the first trailer</a> for her new Netflix lifestyle show.</p>



<p>The series, titled <em>With Love, From Meghan</em>, features the duchess and her celebrity pals cooking meals, arranging flowers, and offering a wide array of tips and tricks for aspiring hosts and hostesses</p>



<p>In other words, it&#8217;s Meghan&#8217;s way of confirming her intention to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become her generation&#8217;s Martha Stewart</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-new-show-meets-with-criticism">Meghan&#8217;s New Show Meets With Criticism</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Martha&#8217;s successs might be a product of a bygone era. </p>



<p>These days, dinner parties are mostly a thing of the past, and folks who are in need of culinary tips are probably finding them on TikTok.</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-slammed-for-embarrassing-detail-in-new-years-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s latest Netflix project</a> is receiving such an icy reception. </p>



<p>When the trailer debuted on YouTube, haters rushed to the comments section to blast the Duchess of Sussex for being &#8220;tone deaf&#8221; and &#8220;out of touch.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="665" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1024x665.png" alt="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a scene from her new Netflix show." class="wp-image-515841" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1024x665.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-300x195.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-768x499.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-2048x1330.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-960x623.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1080x701.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1200x779.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a scene from her new Netflix show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And now, Meghan has attracted the unwanted attention of one very high-profile critic: media personality and self-described political nepo-baby Meghan McCain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-vs-meghan">Meghan vs. Meghan</h2>





<p>“I was originally a Meghan Markle supporter, I thought she was cool, stylish and refreshing. Like the rest of the world my opinion changed when she disrespected the royal family,” <a href="https://x.com/MeghanMcCain/status/1874951878108455131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McCain wrote </a>on X (formerly Twitter) today.</p>



<p>“Now that she wants to be American again instead of British aristocracy what she seems to forget is Americans want real, raw, uncensored. All of this even in the trailer is highly curated, produced and out of touch.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-682x1024.jpg" alt="Meghan McCain attends the 2023 Time100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 26, 2023 in New York City." class="wp-image-515936" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan McCain attends the 2023 Time100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 26, 2023 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>From there, McCain cited the recent rash of terroristic violence in the US and accused the other Meghan of announcing her posh new project at an inappropriate time.</p>



<p>&#8220;There have been 2 terror attacks in 2 days, major wars raging and Americans can’t pay for groceries. We are a country in rage, uncertainty and intensity right now,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;This concept is ill advised. I would have told her to do a show helping bring fresh food to food deserts in low income neighborhoods. Do something to help people instead of your ego,&#8221; she continued.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2187696856-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex arrives for The Paley Center for Media gala honoring actor and director Tyler Perry, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills on December 4, 2024.

<p>&#8220;This is why the world doesn’t like you, nothing else. Just completely and utterly tone deaf to the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>McCain&#8217;s remarks echo many of the reactions to the show on YouTube and across social media.</p>



<p>(Although in asserting that &#8220;the world&#8221; doesn&#8217;t like Meghan, McCain went a bit further than most anonymous trolls.)</p>



<p>Obviously, these judgments are premature, as the eight-episode series doesn&#8217;t premiere until January 15.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-lot-on-the-line">A Lot on the Line</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="754" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188304245-754x1024.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, attends The Paley Center for Media hosts Paley Honors Fall Gala honoring Tyler Perry at Beverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel on December 04, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.

<p>But Team Meghan might be feeling a bit nervous at the moment, as the stakes for this project couldn&#8217;t be higher.</p>



<p>Meghan and Prince Harry signed a lucrative deal with Netflix back in 2020, and thus far, the couple has yet to deliver any huge hits.</p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s latest project, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-distancing-themselves-from-polo-series-amid-dismal-reviews-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a docuseries about the world of professional polo</a>, was met with bad reviews and minimal viewership.</p>



<p>Insiders say that after a disappointing 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-returns-to-instagram-rings-in-2025-with-stunning-video-shot-by-prince-harry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry are hoping to make a comeback</a> in the new year.</p>



<p>So they&#8217;d better hope that Netflix subscribers don&#8217;t arrive at the same conclusion that Meghan McCain reached. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll have one more setback to overcome.</p>

<p>Move over, Martha! There&#8217;s a new domestic goddess in town, and she&#8217;s ready to change the way Americans make dinner!</p>



<p>Yes, Meghan Markle is officially bringing her culinary skills to Netflix.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the duchess posted the first trailer for her long-rumored lifestyle series, <em>With Love, Meghan</em>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I have been so excited to share this with you! I hope you love the show as much as I loved making it. Wishing you all a fantastic new year!&#8221; Meghan captioned the post.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks to our amazing crew and the team @netflix. Beyond grateful for the support &#8211; and fun! As ever, Meghan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now we know that Meghan already knew <em>exactly</em> how she intended to leave her mark on the year ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-meghan-hoping-to-cook-up-a-comeback">Is Meghan Hoping to Cook Up a Comeback?</h2>



<p>We <em>don&#8217;t</em> know, however, if there&#8217;s any truth to the rumors of an actual <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud between Meghan and Martha Stewart</a>. But in any event, it&#8217;s clear that Meg&#8217;s got a lot riding on this project.</p>



<p>To put it bluntly, 2024 was not exactly kind to her career.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-was-humiliated-by-spotify-firing-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s Spotify podcast was canceled</a> after just one season, and new polls indicate that Meghan and husband Prince Harry are less popular than ever. </p>

<p>The Sussexes signed a lucrative deal with Netflix back in 2020, but thus far, the partnership has failed to yield the desired results for the streaming giant.</p>



<p>Most recently, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-distancing-themselves-from-polo-series-amid-dismal-reviews-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry- and Meghan-produced docuseries <em>Polo</em></a> debuted to bad reviews and minimal viewership.</p>



<p>Worse, the series prompted allegations that Harry and Meghan are too privileged and out of touch to create content that will appeal to the general public.</p>



<p>And if the comments on today&#8217;s trailer are any indication, YouTube users overwhelmingly share that sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do a show exactly like this but with the real OG &#8211; Martha Stewart,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s all gather around the kitchen island and pretend this woman is the poster child for healing, connection, and community. I&#8217;m feeling so warm and fuzzy! It&#8217;s probably heartburn after this lame basic food. She served and we said no thank you,&#8221; a third chimed in.</p>



<p>A fourth commenter alluded to the allegations that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/meghan-markles-former-aide-breaks-silence-on-bullying-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan had bullied members of her staff</a> at Kensington Palace, writing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cringe, cringe, cringe. I can’t even finish watching the clip. Meghan must be the most insincere person I’ve ever seen. I feel sorry for the staff she bullied.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, Meghan will need to overcome a great deal if she hopes to rebuild her public image in 2025.</p>



<p>But given the amount of vitriol and unfair criticism she&#8217;s endured since she started dating Harry, we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s up to the challenge.</p>
