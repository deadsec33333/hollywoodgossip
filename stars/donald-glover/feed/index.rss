										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything about <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> &#8212; from the lead&#8217;s casting to whatever backstory they&#8217;ve given a beloved character to the fact that this story introduces yet another white brunette&nbsp;leading lady &#8212; is bound to be controversial.</p>
<p>Get excited, or angry, or nervous along with fans and watch the highly anticipated story teaser trailer below!</p>
<p>And check out Donald Glover&#8217;s comments about playing the iconic&nbsp;Lando Calrissian.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The IMDB synopsis of <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> is very succinct:</p>
<p>&quot;During an adventure into a dark criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his future copilot Chewbacca and encounters Lando Calrissian years before joining the Rebellion.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to get people excited in this film.</p>
<p>True, many people feel that there&#8217;s no way that anyone can live up to Harrison Ford as Han Solo.</p>
<p>Also true, there were apparently some difficulties in the film&#8217;s production, to the point that they switched directors.</p>
<p>And, admittedly, as wonderful as Emilia Clarke is, we&#8217;re starting to get the impression that every woman in Star Wars is in fact a white brunette. (Rey, Jyn Erso, Leia, Padme)</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at the positives.</p>
<p>It looks like there&#8217;s going to be some sort of heist, and I am <em>all about</em> some heist movies. Especially in a science fiction setting. (Yes, I know that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> is technically science fantasy &#8230; my excitement stands)</p>
<p>The cast includes Donald Glover (<em>Community</em>, <em>Atlanta</em>), Emilia Clarke (<em>Game of Thrones</em>), Woody Harrelson (I&#8217;m straight up not going to list stuff because he&#8217;s been in so many great things), and Thandie Newton (<em>Westword, The Chronicles of Riddick</em>).</p>
<p>And, from the teasers that we&#8217;ve seen so far, it looks like there&#8217;s going to be some sort of Dark Sided individual whose nature we don&#8217;t know. It doesn&#8217;t look like an Inquisitor (because he lacks a lightsaber), so &#8230; we&#8217;ll all find out together.</p>
<p>At the start, Han Solo is trying to enlist in the Empire in an effort to become a pilot. As we all know, life will end up taking him in a very different direction.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We cannot strongly enough emphasize that everyone&#8217;s reaction to the TV spot during the Superbowl was a positive response to seeing Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian. Wearing black fur.</p>
<p>Seriously, the delight was almost universal.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Us Weekly</em>, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/solo-a-star-wars-story-first-teaser-trailer-airs-during-super-bowl/">Donald Glover reveals</a> what little he can about his experience becoming part of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember going on set one of the first times and [Howard] was like, &lsquo;Yeah, I want to follow you onto the Millennium Falcon and do this.&rsquo; I was like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen the outside go into the inside.&rsquo; And he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Yeah, no one&rsquo;s ever done that shot.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never really thought about it, but you normally only see the Millennium Falcon from the outside or from the interior. It looks like viewers will be getting a tour of what it looks like when you enter the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;As a fan, I was like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m really excited!&rsquo; For me, it was a dream.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, we&#8217;re sure that he&#8217;d have liked to share more, but he cannot.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speaking to <em>ABC</em>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/director-ron-howard-dishes-upcoming-han-solo-star/story?id=51179908">Ron Howard spoke</a> of directing the film but refused to leak any spoilers.</p>
<p>&quot;Those are challenging projects. And they take, you know, a lot of very talented people&rsquo;s energy to try to live up to the legacy of Star Wars and everything that it means.&quot;</p>
<p>No one person can control the fate of <em>Star Wars</em>. There&#8217;s an entire team that makes sure that everything is consistent with established canon and lore and with future plans for the franchise before production begins.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, no spoilers coming from me but I had a great experience and I think fans are going to really enjoy it.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a contrast. Famously, when a reporter asked George Lucas what titular &quot;phantom menace&quot; was before the release of <em>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>, Lucas simply replied &quot;Palpatine.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike George Lucas, however, Ron Howard actually has to answer to Disney.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>A lot of fans are somewhat hesitant to become excited about <em>Solo</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot that can go wrong when you&#8217;re telling a character&#8217;s backstory. Many fans already felt slighted by Han Solo&#8217;s portrayal in <em>The Force Awakens</em>.</p>
<p>And, speaking of the Sequel Trilogy, <em>The Last Jedi</em> was a controversial film among <em>Star Wars</em> fans. Many felt that there were poor decisions made with respect to characterization, pacing, continuity, and the canon of the series.</p>
<p>(Gotta admit that I&#8217;m one of those fans; the review that I wrote up was like 11 pages because I had a <em>lot </em>to say)</p>
<p>Those fans who felt massively disappointed by the most recent film are leery of getting themselves hyped for a new movie that no one really asked for.</p>
<p>That said &#8230; I know that <em>I&#8217;m</em> going to see it. Watch the trailer and decide if you&#8217;re going to see it, too.</p>

Actually, that&#8217;s every night on Twitter in 2017, but this time, it was in a <em>good </em>way.</p>
<p>Because Disney finally found a way to make people not complain about their live-action revivals of classic films.</p>
<p>The recipe for success is complicated, but the key ingredient for all of this <em>The Lion King</em> enthusiasm is &#8230; Beyonce. But she&#8217;s not the only big name in the cast.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-720x1024.jpg" alt="Beyonce Slays" class="wp-image-271603" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-720x1024.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-211x300.jpg 211w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-768x1092.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-1080x1536.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-735x1045.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-236x335.jpg 236w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-244x347.jpg 244w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-366x520.jpg 366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-450x640.jpg 450w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-540x768.jpg 540w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-675x960.jpg 675w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays-759x1080.jpg 759w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/beyonce-slays.jpg 1355w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>As appropriately beautiful as the live action <a href="/videos/beauty-and-the-beast-trailer/"><em>Beauty And The Beast</em> trailer</a> was, it was also a source of controversy.</p>
<p>Many fans saw it as an unoriginal, transparent money-grab by Disney. An effort to feed off of Millennial nostalgia and transform that into profit.</p>
<p>And &#8230; well, the movie was good, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that these critical fans were in any way wrong.</p>
<p>It was, by definition, unoriginal.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Maleficent</em>, it wasn&#8217;t a total reinvention &#8212; it was a retelling.</p>
<p>As for being a money-grab, well &#8230; aren&#8217;t most big production films?</p>
<p><em>Beauty And The Beast</em> raked in over a billion dollars, so it was definitely a success in that department.</p>
<p>The thing is that those who are critical of these live-action remakes of classic Disney films seem to feel that this is all a bad thing.</p>
<p>That is not necessarily so.</p>
<p>But even those who had professed a profound weariness for Disney&#8217;s remakes are more or less losing their minds over The Lion King.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well &#8230; take a look at this cast:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As we mentioned, Beyonce is not the only big name in the newly announced live-action <em>The Lion King</em> cast.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s the biggest, to be sure.</p>
<p>Now, we talked about Millennial nostalgia. Do you know what about half (at least) of &#8217;90s&nbsp;have in common?</p>
<p>Having had a big ol&#8217; crush on Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Seriously, look at any list of childhood celebrity crushes and you&#8217;ll see &quot;JTT.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, JTT voiced Simba in the original animated film.</p>
<p>You know who&#8217;s playing Simba now?</p>
<p>Donald Glover. On whom plenty of those &#8217;90s&nbsp;kids grew up to have a much more <em>adult </em>crush.</p>
<p>Which means that Disney is catering to your weird, confused childhood Simba crush.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-682x1024.jpg" alt="Donald Glover" class="wp-image-132401" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/donald-glover-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images For Entertainment Weekly)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let&#8217;s see &#8230; oh, <em>The Lion King</em>&#8216;s beloved hedonistic and very probably gay couple, Timon and Pumba, will be played by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, respectively.</p>
<p>Zazu will be played by Emmy-winning comedian and talk show host John Oliver, who is almost unbelievably perfect for the role.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, the lions and hyenas will all be played by black actors, while the bird character, the meerkat, and the warthog will be played by white actors.</p>
<p>People have been pointing out for years, as fans of the original film drew human versions of <em>The Lion King</em> characters, that a royal African family should be portrayed as black humans if they&#8217;re going to be humanized.</p>
<p>Disney hasn&#8217;t always been great about racial representation (and they still seem to be deeply in denial about how racist a lot of early Disney stuff was), but they&#8217;ve been making a lot of great strides recently.</p>
<p>Note, by the way, that James Earl Jones will be reprising his role as Mufasa, Simba&#8217;s father.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="772" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-772x1024.jpg" alt="John Oliver Wins an Emmy" class="wp-image-135160" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-772x1024.jpg 772w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-226x300.jpg 226w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-768x1018.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-1159x1536.jpg 1159w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-735x974.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-253x335.jpg 253w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-262x347.jpg 262w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-392x520.jpg 392w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-483x640.jpg 483w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-579x768.jpg 579w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-724x960.jpg 724w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy-815x1080.jpg 815w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/john-oliver-wins-an-emmy.jpg 1363w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now, they&#8217;re calling this a &quot;live-action&quot; remake, but let&#8217;s be clear &#8212; there&#8217;s going to be a lot of CGI.</p>
<p>We imagine that they&#8217;ll all be motion-captured into lions (and other animals) for this musical adventure, but the exact details haven&#8217;t been revealed.</p>
<p>Production only began during the summer.</p>
<p>Honestly, just knowing that Donald Glover and Beyonce are going to be playing an on screen couple will be enough to tide us over for a good long while.</p>
<p>And Baron Mordo from <em>Doctor Strange</em> (that and <em>Serenity</em> are where you&#8217;ve seen him before) playing Scar is a very promising decision, too. Disney films are nothing without a good villain.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m personally the most excited about the new <em>Aladdin</em> (it was my first-ever film in theaters and I was a big Jafar fan growing up), the casting news has more than doubled my enthusiasm for <em>The Lion King</em>.</p>
<p>Really looking forward to 2019!</p>

<p>And now the actor has surprised viewers once again, taking to Instagram to explain his decision to leave the series and shooting down talk that it was over a desire to pursue a rapping career.</p>

<p>“I don’t wanna rap. I wanted to be on my own,&#8221; Glover wrote. &#8220;I’ve been sick this year. I’ve seen a bunch of people die this year. This is my first time I’ve felt helpless… Kept looking for something to be in with. Follow someone’s blueprint. But you have to be on your own.”</p>

<p>Glover rose to fame on <em>Community</em> as the character of Troy Barnes and has also enjoyed a successful run as Childish Gambino, his on-stage rapping persona.</p>
<p>He served as a writer on <em>30 Rock</em> before coming on board <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/community/"><em>Community</em></a> and will be written out of the series about halfway through its return in early 2014.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid [<em>Community</em> creator] Dan Harmon hates me,&#8221; Glover added on Instagram. &#8220;I’m scared I won’t know anything ever again. I’m scared I never knew anything. I’m afraid I’ll regret this. I’m afraid this doesn’t matter at all.”</p>
<p>Damn. Let&#8217;s hope Glover finds whatever he&#8217;s looking for and let&#8217;s hope his next Instagram messages are a bit more positive.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s finally hope Abed can somehow find a replacement for his BFF on <em>Troy and Abed in the Morning</em>.</p>
