<p>As it stands right now, Kody Brown may soon have more lawsuits on his hands than he has wives at home.</p>



<p>First, as previously detailed, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/christine-brown-lawsuit-against-kody-deemed-significant-custody-dispute-by-court/">Christine Brown is suing</a> her ex-spouse for child support.</p>



<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/robyn-brown-questions-meri-sister-wives-trailer/">revealed in a trailer</a> for the back half of Sister Wives Season 19, we see that Meri Brown may also be taking legal action against the father of 18.</p>

<p>This trailer was released a few days ago.</p>



<p>In the sneak peek, it quickly becomes evident that Meri and Kody are at major odds over the division of Coyote Pass, the parcel of land Kody and company purchased way back in 2018.</p>



<p>No construction ever took place on the property.</p>



<p>Fast forward all this time and Kody is only still married to Robyn Brown and clearly no compound will ever be built there, which has created quite a messy issue.</p>



<p>What will happen to it? And how will the money from a potential sale be divided among the Browns?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Meri Brown gestures outdoors on Sister Wives." class="wp-image-521872" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gesturing dramatically on Season 19 of Sister Wives, Meri Brown discusses the future of what was once a shared marital property.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“As long as that property remains a source of contention, I can&#8217;t fully move on,&#8221; Janelle Brown says in this preview prior to Meri opening up to her former sister wife about her own feelings on the topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Janelle, I&#8217;m so mad,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna have to get some lawyers involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cut to a voiceover by Meri and Kody&#8217;s first wife referencing his current wife, Robyn, and stating:</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a few things that I will fight for, and this is one of them. There&#8217;s so many people that are like, &#8216;She was a liar. She was manipulating.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, the concern is that only Robyn and Kody will profit from a Coyote Pass sale.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="995" height="756" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg" alt="Kody Brown versus Meri Brown" class="wp-image-507193" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg 995w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-768x584.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-960x729.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown and Meri Brown on Sister Wives Season 19.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Kody and Robyn are also featured in the trailer&#8230;  reacting to Meri&#8217;s ongoing fight for her portion of Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to rip you off, Meri,&#8221; Kody says in a confessional, while Robyn addresses the camera and tries to play all innocent as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I always had Meri&#8217;s back, even when people were plotting against her, ignoring her,&#8221; she adds.</p>



<p>For those in need of a refresher:</p>



<p>Meri was Kody’s first wife, but Kody filed to divorce her in 2010 so that he could marry Robyn instead. The couple then split after 32 years of marriage in December 2022&#8230; mere days after Kody and his second wife, Janelle, announced <em>they</em> were parting ways. </p>



<p>Christine started all of this, of course, walking away from Kody and their unhealthy relationship in November 2021. </p>



<p><strong>New episodes of Sister Wives kick off on Sunday, April 20 at 9/8c on TLC.</strong></p>

<p>Coyote Pass drama has Robyn Brown &#8220;questioning&#8221; where she stands with Meri.</p>



<p>In the new <em>Sister Wives</em> trailer for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/sister-wives-canceled-season-19-plan-stirs-up-controversy-confusion-among-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the remainder of Season 19</a>, we&#8217;re seeing how dividing marital property doesn&#8217;t get <em>simpler </em>in a plural marriage.</p>



<p>Meri is threatening legal action &#8212;  especially since Kody seems to think that he&#8217;s the sole decider for Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Robyn is reeling from Meri&#8217;s attitude, and wondering if they were ever really friends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-brown-is-not-a-happy-camper-on-sister-wives">Meri Brown is not a happy camper on &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217;</h2>



<p>On Thursday, March 20, TLC released the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHbOkYbseDK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> for the remainder of <em>Sister Wives </em>Season 19.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the teaser clip, Meri Brown and Janelle Brown are reflecting upon the seemingly unending Coyote Pass drama.</p>



<p>“As long as that property remains a source of contention, I can’t fully move on,” Janelle admits to the confessional camera.</p>

<p>Janelle was not the only ex feeling stuck. Meri Brown told her that she felt &#8220;so mad,&#8221; even suggesting legal action.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna have to get some lawyers involved,&#8221; she threatened.</p>



<p>“There’s a few things that I will fight for, and this is one of them,” Meri continued. “There’s so many people that are like, ‘She was a liar. She was manipulating.’” (Not all of the context is clear; this is a trailer)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-robyn-brown-is-questioning-her-bond-with-meri">Now, Robyn Brown is &#8216;questioning&#8217; her &#8216;bond&#8217; with Meri</h2>



<p>“I always had Meri’s back,&#8221; Robyn Brown insisted during the trailer.</p>



<p>Kody&#8217;s sole remaining wife insisted that this remained true &#8220;even when people were plotting against her, ignoring her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Robyn stated that she and Meri always had a &#8220;bond,&#8221; one that she was &#8220;now questioning.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Why tell me that you want to have a relationship with me and then ghost me?” Robyn Brown asked, seemingly continuing to voice her frustrations over Meri.</p>



<p>As you might guess, Kody Brown insisted that he was &#8220;not trying to rip&#8221; off Meri Brown when it comes to the shattered homestead dreams on Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>Discussion of Coyote Pass has dominated many seasons. In Season 19, it&#8217;s more about what becomes of the property now that Kody&#8217;s plural marriage is now singular.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-will-become-of-coyote-pass">What will become of Coyote Pass?</h2>



<p>Earlier this season, it was clear that Meri and Janelle Brown do not believe that Kody &#8212; or Robyn, or anyone &#8212; gets to unilaterally decide what becomes of the property.</p>



<p>“I don’t think you get to decide what we do with it,” Meri stressed. “Sorry, you are not the head of my family.”</p>



<p>The only person with no skin in this game is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/christine-brown-book-cover-unveiled-cleavage-heavy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine</a>, who sold her portion to Kody and Robyn for a whopping $10. Sometimes, taking the loss is worth it to wash your hands of a messy, miserable situation.</p>



<p><em>Sister Wives</em> Season 19 resumes on April 20.</p>

<p>Meri Brown is very much on the market.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean the Sister Wives star likes what has been available thus far.</p>



<p>As readers are likely aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">Meri and Kody Brown terminated</a> their marriage almost two years ago to the date; not that they had been a very healthy relationship even before that official announcement.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the current day and Meri is still seeking her special someone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dating has been interesting. I&#8217;ve been dating, nobody exclusive at this point,&#8221; <a href="https://parade.com/tv/sister-wives-meri-brown-details-challenges-dating-after-kody-split-exclusive">Brown told Parade</a> this week. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit weird … I live in a small town that has a very, very, very, very small dating pool. So I need to spread my wings. Go to Vegas or Salt Lake [City]&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I would love to meet somebody just organically out in public, but I just don&#8217;t know how to do that. It&#8217;s really hard,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;I hear people say men don&#8217;t talk to women anymore. They don&#8217;t, you know? </p>



<p>&#8220;So it has to be the woman to take the initiative. And I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t want that. If I have to take the initiative and be [the] boss man, then I&#8217;m not interested. The guy needs to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/behind-the-meri-brown-breakup-why-did-she-dump-amos-andrews/">Meri <em>did</em> find a boyfriend</a> early last year, but the relationship didn&#8217;t last long.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, she&#8217;s hoping to find &#8220;somebody who&#8217;s independent. Somebody who can treat me with kindness and honesty and respect, who can meet my energy. Probably tall. I want a tall guy. And also who my dog loves. And he loves my dog.&#8221;</p>



<p>TLC viewers <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meri-brown-reveals-break-up-text-to-kody-thank-you-for-many-years-of-joy/">witnessed Meri and Kody&#8217;s emotional goodbye</a> on Season 19.</p>



<p>The exes aren&#8217;t on bad terms, but don&#8217;t communicate much these days, either.</p>

<p>To those maybe wanting to ask Meri Brown out one day? She detailed her ideal first date to Parade as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;Fun and laughter and easy conversations. Dinner would be great, [a] movie would be great. Walk in the park would be great. I&#8217;m open to options.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like sitting down and having a conversation limits what you can do. </p>



<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re out and about and you&#8217;re doing something, whether it&#8217;s just a walk in the park or skiing, I don&#8217;t know, whatever, you can kind of interact a little bit more.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it turns out, Kody Brown isn&#8217;t just selfish, close-minded and even impure (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kody-brown-reveals-heartbreaking-way-he-lost-his-virginity/">by his own admission</a>)&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; he&#8217;s also sort of a pig.</p>



<p>Viewers saw this for themselves on the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kody-brown-proposes-to-robyn-will-you-be-my-only-wife/">January 5 episode of Sister Wives</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="926" height="743" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509880" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg 926w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-300x241.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-768x616.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody and Meri Brown are no longer an item.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>At one point on this installment, Kody acted surprised and even annoyed that his ex-wife had decided she no longer wanted him to see her without any clothes on.</p>



<p>“Meri’s attitude changed, where I didn’t feel like mine did,” Kody explained on air, illustrating one example of this point as follows: </p>



<p>“What she started doing was when I would go into the house, and normally you might see your wife dressing, she would cover herself up and hide.”</p>



<p>Well, yeah, dude. Meri is no longer your wife.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="807" height="640" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/rs_1024x656-241122054507-Screenshot_2024-11-22_082154-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515303" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/rs_1024x656-241122054507-Screenshot_2024-11-22_082154-copy.jpg 807w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/rs_1024x656-241122054507-Screenshot_2024-11-22_082154-copy-300x238.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/rs_1024x656-241122054507-Screenshot_2024-11-22_082154-copy-768x609.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown and Kody Brown says their emotional goodbye.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meri made this simple and obvious statement herself on the episode, saying that the spouses were still “spiritually” married, but she had chosen to leave Kody.</p>



<p>And, let&#8217;s face it, the two <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/meri-brown-its-been-10-years-im-dying-to-sleep-with-kody-again/">had not been intimate in over a decade</a> anyway.</p>



<p>“If you and I are not having a husband/wife relationship and you walk in the room, why would I expose myself to you?” Meri asked the cameras during a confessional. “Of course I’m going to guard myself.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s sort of insane that Meri even has to make this statement, isn&#8217;t it? Only Kody Brown would think otherwise.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="809" height="564" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/rs_1024x570-241127105506-Screenshot_2024-11-27_134959-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516005" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/rs_1024x570-241127105506-Screenshot_2024-11-27_134959-copy.jpg 809w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/rs_1024x570-241127105506-Screenshot_2024-11-27_134959-copy-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/rs_1024x570-241127105506-Screenshot_2024-11-27_134959-copy-768x535.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown just doesn&#8217;t seem like a very nice guy.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kody, who opened up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kody-brown-reveals-heartbreaking-way-he-lost-his-virginity/">about the loss of this virginity</a> on this same episode, just doesn&#8217;t seem to get it. Any of it at all.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Meri finally came to this same conclusion in January 2023 when she and her ex terminated their union.</p>



<p>“All I can do is look in the mirror, figure out where I can improve and be a better person and just make the rest of my life as good as it can be,” Meri said to her best friend this week. “And I tried to do that with, you know, the marriage.”</p>



<p>She did.</p>



<p>And we hope Meri can hold her head up high as a result &#8212; while keeping her clothes very much <em>on</em> any time she&#8217;s in the presence of Kody.</p>

<p>Meri Brown is opening up a great deal these days about where things stand with various members of her family.</p>



<p>A few days ago, for example, the reality star provided an update <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meri-brown-delivers-rare-update-on-transgender-daughter/">on her transgender daughter</a>, Leon.</p>



<p>Prior to that, the Sister Wives cast member made it clear that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/meri-brown-responds-will-she-ever-get-back-together-with-kody/">she will never get back together </a>with ex-spouse Kody Brown.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/meri-robyn-brown-092923-tout-a173d70bce2e4d72a4228e252f21a1d2.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-515519" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/meri-robyn-brown-092923-tout-a173d70bce2e4d72a4228e252f21a1d2.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/meri-robyn-brown-092923-tout-a173d70bce2e4d72a4228e252f21a1d2-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is a split screen of Robyn Brown and Meri Brown.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meri is here to talk about her relationship with former sister wife Robyn Brown. Or her <em>lack</em> of one, really.</p>



<p>&#8220;Robyn and I don&#8217;t really talk a lot,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/sister-wives-meri-brown-doesnt-really-talk-a-lot-with-robyn-brown-exclusive-8761547">Meri tells People Magazine</a> in a new interview, referencing her split last year from Kody and adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;I know that it was really hard for her when I left, and I suspect that she&#8217;s probably just trying to figure out her life completely different than she thought that it was going to be.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is accurate.</p>



<p>Awhile ago &#8212; following the departures of Meri, Christine and Janelle &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-am-i-an-idiot-for-sticking-with-kody/">Robyn wondered whether she was</a> an idiot for sticking by Kody&#8217;s romantic side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that their day-to-day life has changed a whole lot because it&#8217;s been the same thing it has been for the past quite a few years,&#8221; Meri also said to People this week. </p>



<p>&#8220;But just knowing that she&#8217;s full-on monogamous, I&#8217;m sure that she has been trying to navigate that herself. But she and I don&#8217;t have a lot of interaction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown has been on her own journey for a long time now.</p>



<p>She said in this feature that she&#8217;s needing these days to &#8220;focus on me and my future and who&#8217;s going to be a cheerleader for what I&#8217;m trying to do in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Meri&#8217;s relationships with her other ex-sister wives?</p>



<p>She and Christine shared a lovely moment at Gwendlyn Brown&#8217;s bridal shower, embracing as the latter reassured Meri that life would be &#8220;better on the other side&#8221; following her separation from Kody. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, Meri has been speaking about plans for the Brown family&#8217;s Coyote Pass property with Janelle, who warned her to &#8220;protect&#8221; herself amid ongoing sale drama of that land.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s &#8220;always a chance&#8221; Meri thinks she could salvage things between herself and these women.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really just depends on if both parties are involved,&#8221; she explained to People, citing Christine in particular and stating:</p>



<p>&#8220;Right now, I don&#8217;t think that she&#8217;s at that place. I don&#8217;t think that she wants to. I&#8217;m totally happy with where I am in my life as well, and I wish her all the best. Our paths just are not aligned. We&#8217;re not living parallel lives right now. But they might cross. I never know.&#8221;</p>



<p>On the December 15 episode of Sister Wives, Meri opened up about her ongoing frustrations with Robyn, who isn&#8217;t close (<strong><em>at all</em></strong>) to any of Kody&#8217;s exes.</p>



<p>&#8220;The fact that Robyn didn&#8217;t come to my mom&#8217;s funeral and support me in that way at that time was very hurtful to me,&#8221; Meri said in a confessional. </p>



<p>&#8220;They were following the COVID rules and you know, I felt really bad about that and I kind of understood, but Kody ended up going too. The whole thing was really confusing to me that she wouldn&#8217;t go because Janelle went.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meri Brown took viewers behind the romantic scenes this past Sunday night.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of Sister Wives, fans went back in time&#8230; back to when Meri and Kody Brown were still a spiritual couple.</p>



<p>An unhappy one, however.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="926" height="743" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509880" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg 926w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-300x241.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-768x616.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody and Meri Brown are no longer an item.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Kody basically had a list for me to do before we would start working on a relationship,&#8221; Meri explained of a ridiculous, selfish request from her then-husband.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it was around this period of time that Meri realized she had to get away from the former polygamist.</p>



<p>For this reason, on the same installment of the reality show, Meri met up with two friends and expressed shock that Kody accused her of having a &#8220;guy on the side&#8221; after she turned to the church and requested <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">a termination of her union</a>.</p>



<p>Once they were no longer husband and wife in the eyes of their religion, Meri said that she “texted [Kody] and he called [her] within 20 minutes.”</p>

<p>Meri even read this text message to her pals and, as a result, to those tuning in to Sister Wives. This is what her break-up text in early 2023 read:</p>



<p><em>Hi Kody, just wanted to follow up from the text I sent a couple weeks ago. Just wanted to let you know that I had a conversation with the leadership in Utah today and the official release was granted. </em></p>



<p><em>I’m brokenhearted that our life came to this. I will always love and respect you. Thank you for many years of joy. </em></p>



<p><em>I hope you truly will have peace now and I release you from any responsibility or worry about me. I got this</em>.</p>

<p>This episode was filmed a very long time ago, of course.</p>



<p>Meri has made it clear in the time since that she has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/meri-brown-responds-will-she-ever-get-back-together-with-kody/">no interest in getting back together with Kody</a>, who is now only married to Robyn Brown because Janelle and Christine have also gone their separate ways.</p>



<p>But Meri stuck around the longest.</p>



<p>Even after the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/meri-brown-its-been-10-years-im-dying-to-sleep-with-kody-again/">two stopped having intercourse</a> and after Kody made it clear he had no real affection for her any longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just a lot of things that he says and does that have been really, really confusing to me over the years, which also is why I stayed with him for so long,&#8221; Meri said on a previous Season 19 episode of the show.</p>



<p>The mother of one and Kody exchanged vows in 1990 and got legally divorced in 2014. </p>



<p>However, they remained together until they confirmed their split via joint statement in January 2023.</p>



<p>“We feel compelled to share our own truth, in our own way and in our own timing,” the pair wrote in a statement posted via Instagram. “After more than a decade of working on our relationship in our own unique ways, we have made the decision to permanently terminate our marriage relationship.”</p>

<p>Meri Brown is here with an unexpected and unusual update on her transgender child, Leon.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives sat down this week with People Magazine to discuss the 29-year old, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/sister-wives-star-comes-out-as-trans-announces-new-name-and-pronouns/">came out as transgender</a> in June 2022.</p>



<p>&#8220;They, by their choice, have made a decision to not be super public,&#8221; Meri told People, using the pronoun Leon has said they would prefer and adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;So I don&#8217;t talk about them so much.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/leon-brown-transgender-sister-wives-star-undergoes-gender-reassignment-surgery/">Leon Brown underwent gender reassignment surgery</a> in January 2023 and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/surprise-leon-brown-and-audry-kriss-are-married/">married partner Audrey Kriss</a> about nine months later.</p>



<p>Meri, for her part, said that &#8220;whatever they want to put on social media is what people get to know about them,&#8221; emphasizing that she tries to respect Leon&#8217;s request for privacy.</p>



<p>&#8220;We talk often,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/sister-wives-star-meri-brown-gives-rare-update-on-her-child-leon-exclusive-8760871">Meri did tell People</a>, though. &#8220;They&#8217;re doing well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leon appeared here and there on Sister Wives over the years, but has been absent now for a number of seasons.</p>



<p>Most fans assume this is due to the tension that continues to exist between Kody, his only remaining spouse Robyn and most of Kody&#8217;s adult children.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93-1024x538.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513510" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93-300x158.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93-768x403.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93-960x504.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93-1080x567.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/meri-brown-sister-wives-premiere-zz-240910-054d93.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown was very unhappy for most of her marriage to Kody.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to dissect there, and I think that it&#8217;s very fair for everybody that they have their own feelings and perspectives about it, and they&#8217;re real for them,&#8221; Meri simply told People. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re real for Kody and Robyn, and they&#8217;re real for the kids. You know what I mean? And they&#8217;re very different for each.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-to-kody-dude-your-family-hates-you/">Kody isn&#8217;t close</a> to his sons or his daughters.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a secret, either, that we aren&#8217;t major fans of Kody Brown here at The Hollywood Gossip.</p>



<p>It only makes matter worse than a source told The Sun last year that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/kody-brown-is-he-actually-disgusted-by-his-transgender-child/">Kody is &#8220;disgusted&#8221; by Leon&#8217;s transition</a>, but we cannot verify that allegation. Overall, Kody has actually seemed rather tolerant of the LGBTQ community.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-11-at-11.53.22%E2%80%AFAM-1024x590.png" alt="Meri Brown on the season 19 premiere of Sister Wives." class="wp-image-509053"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown on the season 19 premiere of Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meri is attempting to stay neutral in any controversy between her ex-husband and her kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you look at The Wizard of Oz, you see one perspective, and then you watch Wicked and it&#8217;s a completely different perspective,&#8221; she mysteriously added to People, referencing the smash hit play and movie and implying that Kody and his kids have different visions/ideas of the truth.</p>



<p>Leon, meanwhile?</p>



<p>“Someone recently told me that I didn’t have to have all of my sh-t figured out in order for me to share myself with the world,” they wrote on social media two and a half years ago.</p>



<p>“So here’s me, definitely not having almost any of my sh-t figured out, to let you know that I am trans.”</p>



<p>“My name is Leon or Leo (I love both) and my pronouns are they/them&#8230;</p>



<p>“Being queer &amp; trans are definitely some of my favorite parts of myself,” but “there are so many things that I am learning to love about myself through this process.</p>



<p>“Here’s to me getting to know myself, share myself, and continually evolve to be the person I am, to be my favorite self in all contexts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>In a word?</p>



<p><em>YIKES</em>.</p>



<p>Late last week, Mykelti Brown &#8212; the daughter of Sister Wives stars Christine and Kody Brown &#8212; strongly hinted (for the second time!) at something troubling from her family&#8217;s past.</p>



<p>She basically said that Meri Brown was abusive toward Kody during their marriage.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-12.18.47%E2%80%AFPM-1024x565.png" alt="Meri Brown hugs Kody in tearful goodbye" class="wp-image-513784"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown hugs Kody in tearful goodbye on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“There was a YouTuber who made a video wondering if Meri was abusive, either mentally or physically or both, to your dad, and that’s why he treated her the way he did,” the 28-year old said in a Q&amp;A video on November 22.</p>



<p>This question seemed especially relevant over the weekend because the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/sister-wives-recap-season-19-episode-11/">latest Sister Wives episode featured</a> Kody dropped Meri off at her new home in Utah.</p>



<p>“I’m not saying anything,” Christine’s second oldest child said after faking a stunned reaction&#8230; prior to saying a whole lot:</p>



<p>“Anything I say in response to that, I could probably get in trouble with&#8230; But I think that if you’re thinking it, and other people are thinking it too, you guys are probably not far off. And that’s all I’m gonna say there. </p>



<p>‘Cause I know there’s a million and a half YouTubers that watch this and I just don’t want to deal with being called and getting in trouble. So that’s all I’m gonna say.”</p>

<p>That seems to be enough, though, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Especially when you flash back to January 2023 and the time Mykelti made a similar allegation against Meri.</p>



<p>“I’m speaking on my own personal experiences and opinion on Meri Brown. I don’t want to discount my siblings’ experiences with her,” Mykelti said in Patreon footage back then, adding: </p>



<p>“I don’t remember Meri ever being physically abusive to me. She was very emotionally and verbally abusive to all of us when we were younger.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="995" height="756" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg" alt="Kody Brown versus Meri Brown" class="wp-image-507193" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg 995w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-768x584.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-960x729.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown and Meri Brown on Sister Wives Season 19.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Very early last year, Paedon Brown <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/sister-wives-stunner-paedon-brown-accuses-meri-of-abuse/">said the following about Meri</a>:</p>



<p>“Meri was not nice… Abrasive is not enough of a word to explain what Meri was to a few of us children specifically.”</p>



<p>The son of Christine and Kody, Paedon offered few specifics, but did add in frightening fashion: “It move[d] so far past verbal. Verbal basically stopped existing.”</p>



<p>Again: <em>YIKES</em>, huh?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-11-at-11.53.22%E2%80%AFAM-1024x590.png" alt="Meri Brown on the season 19 premiere of Sister Wives." class="wp-image-509053"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown on the season 19 premiere of Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gwendlyn Brown, meanwhile, yet another child of Christine and Kody, echoed her brother&#8217;s claims around this same time.</p>



<p>“[Meri] was scary as a kid, but she never attacked me and I only saw her violent once,” Gwendlyn said, elaborating many months ago:</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/gwendlyn-brown-its-true-meri-once-got-violent-with-mykelti/">Meri had moments where she was rude</a> and scary but I don’t remember her getting physical with anyone except for Mykelti and that was only once.</p>



<p>“I believe that everyone deserves a second chance… I don’t know anything about saving anyone’s life, honestly. She was met with more dislike than anything.”</p>

<p>As far as we know, Meri has never responded to these accusations.</p>



<p>For her part, Mykelti previously said that Meri would “not, nor will she ever be, part of my life nor my husband’s or my kids’ lives because of the trauma I experienced as a child growing up.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">Meri and Kody split</a> for good nearly two years ago.</p>



<p>“After more than a decade of working on our relationship in our own unique ways, we have made the decision to permanently terminate our marriage relationship,&#8221; the twosome said in a joint statement in January 2023.</p>

<p>Meri Brown knows what she wants.</p>



<p>Or to perhaps be more specific&#8230; Meri Brown knows what she does NOT want.</p>



<p>As the final episodes of Sister Wives season 19 air, the last days of Kody and Meri&#8217;s marriage play out for everyone to see. </p>



<p>There have been hurtful moments, there have been heartfelt moments, and there have been even moments where it feels like Kody and Meri might be thinking about starting over again. </p>



<p>But as the show was filmed in January 2023, we know that&#8217;s not the case. Still, could the door still be open for a reconciliation?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-brown-gets-honest-about-kody-real-honest">Meri Brown Gets Honest About Kody &#8211; Real Honest</h2>



<p>The<em> Sister Wives</em> star appeared  on <em>The Sarah Fraser Show</em> in July and delved into a number of personal topics.</p>



<p>She wondered, for example, if she ought to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/meri-brown-hmmm-should-i-have-left-kody-sooner/">have walked away from her marriage to Kody Brown</a> sooner than she did.</p>



<p>Now that <em>is</em> finally free, however, after the pair <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">announced they had terminated their relationship</a> in January 2023, Meri made it clear during this interview:</p>



<p>She has no intention of going back.</p>



<p>Noting at one that she&#8217;s seen the speculating headlines &#8220;all the time&#8221; about a possible reconciliation, Meri assured podcast listeners: </p>



<p>&#8220;I promise that one&#8217;s never gonna happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mother of even then started singing part of Taylor Swift&#8217;s hit song &#8220;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&#8221; to really drive this key point home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-given-their-history-can-you-blame-her">Given Their History, Can You Blame Her?!</h2>



<p>Along with Meri and Robyn, Kody was married to Janelle Brown and Christine Brown. </p>



<p>As you likely know at this point, Christine was the first to leave their plural marriage when she announced her split from Kody in November 2021 &#8230; after more than 25 years as a couple. </p>



<p>Janelle was the second sister wife to leave, confirming her separation from Kody in December 2022. </p>



<p>Meri then followed soon afterward, leaving Robyn as Kody&#8217;s only legal wife. And only wife, period.</p>



<p>As for how Robyn feels at this point about the end of her unusually large family? <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/meri-brown-good-riddance-to-kody-and-robyn-ive-moved-on/">Meri isn&#8217;t entirely certain</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like she was sad. I feel like that she had this idea when she came in the family of this big plural family. I really think that,&#8221; Meri tried to explain on the podcast. </p>



<p>&#8220;But then things were not matching up either. And I got that from Kody too. It&#8217;s like things … there was a lot of confusion.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/behind-the-meri-brown-breakup-why-did-she-dump-amos-andrews/">Meri had a boyfriend</a> for a brief period of time a few months ago, but the romance didn&#8217;t last long.</p>



<p>Still, Meri is focused on what lies ahead &#8212; not what came before.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="534" height="520" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/5afc07a276474d25999fd68cf5ef1c6f_md-copy.jpg" alt="Kody and Meri Brown on Sister Wives" class="wp-image-487581" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/5afc07a276474d25999fd68cf5ef1c6f_md-copy.jpg 534w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/5afc07a276474d25999fd68cf5ef1c6f_md-copy-300x292.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/5afc07a276474d25999fd68cf5ef1c6f_md-copy-335x326.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/5afc07a276474d25999fd68cf5ef1c6f_md-copy-347x338.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/5afc07a276474d25999fd68cf5ef1c6f_md-copy-520x506.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody and Meri Brown get into an argument in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in this place where I&#8217;m moving forward with my life,&#8221; Meri told listeners on July 29, adding at the time: </p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s aspects of my life that they still need to be involved in, but my day-to-day is my best friend and my day-to-day is my people that are helping me to move forward and I don&#8217;t want to interact with people that are not helping me to move forward.”</p>



<p>Sounds like a great attitude to us!</p>



<p>We wish Meri Brown the best of luck.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/meri-brown-sister-wives-spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meri Brown</a> has traded her <em>Sister Wives</em> life for a haunted house! </p>



<p>Or so we&#8217;re told </p>



<p>We all know how Meri Brown is doing on a personal basis these days: She&#8217;s trying.</p>



<p>The veteran <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/meri-brown-to-former-sister-wives-good-riddance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sister Wives </a></em>cast member split from spiritual spouse <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kody-brown-family-tree-explained-very-confusing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody Brown </a>in January 2023 and has since made an effort to tell folks that she&#8217;s looking forward to the future.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s forging a new path, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/meri-brown-kody-who-im-forging-a-new-path/">Meri might say</a>. And we&#8217;re watching that all unfold on the latest season of <em>Sister Wives</em>, which was filmed at the time of the split. </p>



<p>As part of that, Meri moved back to her native state of Utah shortly after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">terminating her marriage</a> and reportedly <em>into</em> Lizzie&#8217;s Heritage Inn, the bed and breakfast she has owned there for years.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-brown-s-bed-amp-breakfast-is-haunted">Meri Brown&#8217;s  Bed &amp; Breakfast Is Haunted!</h2>



<p>It turns out, there are funny rumors about the house she lives and rents out. Spooky, scary rumors! </p>



<p>&#8220;Guests have told Meri and the manager, Jenn, that the <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/8487805/sister-wives-meri-brown-utah-inn-haunted-dead-photos/">inn was haunted</a>,&#8221; a source told <em>The Sun</em> in July. </p>



<p>&#8220;Like, they would hear spooky noises and claim that ghosts are living there. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like something bad would happen &#8211; it&#8217;s just a freaky thing and coincidence that dead people are on the wall.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown opened Lizzie&#8217;s Heritage Inn in December 2017; it had been her old family home, which was occupied by four generations until it was sold in the 1980s.</p>



<p>The dead people referenced above consist of portraits of some of the former owners, including Bonnie, Meri&#8217;s mother who helped run the inn and who passed away in 2021.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is actually creepy to go to sleep in one of the rooms and have a late person&#8217;s photo on the wall stare at you,&#8221; writes <em>The Sun.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-pokes-fun-at-haunted-house-rumors">Meri Pokes Fun At Haunted House Rumors </h2>



<p>Now, Kody&#8217;s ex-wife is well aware of the rumors surround her inn, but sadly, she can&#8217;t say that she herself has seen a ghost. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been told we have friendly family member ghosts, although I haven’t ever seen them,&#8221; she admitted on an episode of the show. </p>



<p>In October 2023, Janelle Brown stayed in the establishment despite concerns that apparitions existed within its walls, but she too was not visited. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s a wonderful place. I’m glad we stayed. I didn’t see a ghost, for the record,&#8221; Janelle said on an episode of <em>Sister Wives</em>.</p>



<p>A year later, however, it seemed that Meri finally encountered one of the famed ghouls living in her inn.</p>

<p>Meri posted the above photo of herself and her friend Jen enjoying a night at home, when an intruder interrupted their evening. </p>



<p>Amid the cobwebs and spiders set up for Halloween, a young girl in a white dress, photobombed the pair covering her face with her hair as she stared blankly at the camera.</p>



<p>&#8220;Beware the little&nbsp;ghosts&nbsp;and goblins that drop in to @lizzies_heritage_inn,&#8221; Meri captioned the post.</p>



<p>Of course, we jest. This is just Meri leaning into the ghost stories &#8211; as all owners should! Who doesn&#8217;t love a haunted house! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-s-doing-well-for-herself">Meri&#8217;s Doing Well For Herself </h2>



<p>Despite the alleged haunting, the inn has a 4.5 star rating on Google and has received five stars on Tripadvisor and Yelp.</p>



<p>This is good, as Meri counts on the inn to help support herself in this new chapter of her life. Along with the inn, in 2024 she launched a lifestyle brand called Worthy Up.</p>



<p>It remains in development, as does the<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/sister-wives-season-19-updates/"> upcoming season of <em>Sister Wive</em></a><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/sister-wives-season-19-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>s</em></a>, which she will appear in, and perhaps a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/sister-wives-memoir-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memoir</a> that will likely detail everything her life with the Brown family.</p>



<p>All in all, Meri isn&#8217;t doing that bad! </p>
