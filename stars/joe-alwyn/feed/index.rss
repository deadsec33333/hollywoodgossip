<p>Joe Alwyn did more than merely attend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2025 Oscars</a> &#8212; he was also a presenter.</p>



<p>After all, he was in one of this awards season&#8217;s strongest contenders. </p>



<p>Even so, many people know Alwyn for his erstwhile <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/joe-alwyn-breaks-silence-on-loving-committed-relationship-with-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship with Taylor Swift</a>. Meanwhile, he is fairly private about his personal life.</p>



<p>That romance ended nearly two years ago. It&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;d like to put it behind him, and refocus attention upon his acting.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Joe Alwyn on March 2, 2025." class="wp-image-520498" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Alwyn attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-alwyn-attended-the-2025-oscars">Joe Alwyn attended the 2025 Oscars</h2>



<p>On Sunday, March 2, Joe Alwyn served as a presenter during the 2025 Academy Awards.</p>



<p>He stood on the stage to help present the award for Best Cinematography.</p>



<p>As you are likely already aware, that particular award went to Lol Crawley for <em>The Brutalist</em>. Alwyn portrayed the son of Guy Pearce&#8217;s character in the film.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Joe Alwyn on February 15, 2025." class="wp-image-520499" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Alwyn attends the &#8220;Charles Finch &amp; Chanel Pre-BAFTA party&#8221; at 5 Hertford Street on February 15, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Shane Anthony Sinclair/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While walking the red carpet ahead of the Oscars ceremony, Joe Alwyn wore a simple black tux with a white dress shirt and a black bow tie. Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; the Oscars are one of the few events where unironically wearing a bow tie is not necessarily a red flag.</p>



<p>With the actor wearing such a simple, even basic ensemble, his brooch caught a lot of eyes. The purple and yellow petals of the motif were eye-catching, as was its use of color. </p>



<p>Sometimes, an achromatic color scheme like a tux is just a backdrop for the <em>real </em>star of the show.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-though-joe-alwyn-did-not-take-home-an-oscar-he-has-been-focusing-upon-his-career">Though Joe Alwyn did not take home an Oscar, he has been focusing upon his career</h2>



<p>Though <em>The Brutalist</em> was up for ten potential Academy Awards this year and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/oscar-winners-2025-list-anora-the-brutalist-1236323560/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won</a> three of them, none singled out Joe Alwyn.</p>



<p>The Best Picture nomination would at least include everyone involved (in theory). Adrien Brody received a nomination (and win!) for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Guy Pearce received a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Felicity Jones received a nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.</p>



<p>Then came Best Directing, Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), Best Production Design, and Best Writing (Original Screenplay). Daniel Blumberg <em>did </em>take home the Oscar for the score, and Alwyn helped present Lol Crawley with the cinematography award.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Joe Alwyn on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-520501" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_joealwyn_04-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Alwyn attends the EE BAFTA Film Awards 2025 at The Royal Festival Hall on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kate Green/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though it is not his primary claim to fame, Joe Alwyn takes his acting career very seriously.</p>



<p>However, even now, he is most famous &#8212; by far &#8212; for his six-year relationship with Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>The two got together (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/05/ashley-benson-and-cara-delevingne-broke-up-because-2020-hates-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cara Delevingne</a> introduced them) when Taylor was taking a break from the spotlight. The two had a long, quiet romance, and only broke up in early 2023.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-would-prefer-for-people-to-know-him-as-an-actor">We would prefer for people to know him as an actor</h2>



<p>Joe and Taylor avoided the limelight &#8212; as much as is possible for one of the most famous people on the planet and her boyfriend &#8212; for much of their romance.</p>



<p>Their breakup ultimately stirred more conversation than their quiet relationship. Even Taylor&#8217;s post-split album seemed to focus more lyrics upon (people believe) her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/taylor-swift-and-matty-healy-split-dirtbag-summer-is-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mistaken dalliance with Matty Healy</a> than on Alwyn.</p>



<p>Alwyn is an actor. That is his job, and he would prefer for public attention to focus upon his career. Perhaps, one day, he will get his wish.</p>

<p>Why does Joe Alwyn look so <em>cozy </em>with Kendall Jenner?</p>



<p>This past year has gone very well <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/taylor-swift-announces-eras-tour-book-get-all-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for Taylor Swift</a>. But while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-yankees-game-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current relationship</a> makes headlines, her ex is no stranger to fame, either.</p>



<p>Why would Joe Alwyn cozy up to someone with whom Taylor has a seemingly contentious relationship?</p>



<p>Taylor isn&#8217;t exactly besties with Kendall Jenner. What&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s angle?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-joe-alwyn-and-kendall-jenner-look-so-cozy-here">Don&#8217;t Joe Alwyn and Kendall Jenner look so cozy, here?</h2>



<p>In a cozy new photo that <em>Vogue </em>shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBWX2I0pbQj/?img_index=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, Joe Alwyn is posing with Kendall Jenner.</p>



<p>To be clear, it&#8217;s not a <em>date night</em> photo. At least, not to anyone&#8217;s knowledge. Rather, on Saturday, October 19, both Joe Alwyn and Kendall Jenner attended the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>As you can see in one of the photos below, Joe posed with his arm around a blonde Kendall.

<p>Sometimes, famous people just bump into each other, whether they&#8217;re at a party or an industry function (or, often, <em>both</em>). This can mean posing for photos with strangers &#8212; or with people who will one day be notorious monsters.</p>



<p>However, Joe Alwyn <em>obviously </em>knows who Kendall Jenner is. In fact, he spent many years with Taylor in the immediate aftermath of her 2016 takedown.</p>



<p>Not to mention that Taylor and Kendall were both seemingly in entanglements with Harry Styles within mere months of each other.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-aren-t-taylor-swift-and-kendall-jenner-besties">Why aren&#8217;t Taylor Swift and Kendall Jenner besties?</h2>



<p>There was a time when Kendall Jenner had enough mutual friends with Taylor Swift that people assumed that they were friendly. Not besties, and Kendall was never part of Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;squad&#8221; to anyone&#8217;s knowledge. But they didn&#8217;t seem to have any issues.</p>



<p>However, in 2016, Kanye West capitalized on Taylor Swift&#8217;s absolutely-everywhere popularity by singing about her in &#8220;Famous,&#8221; calling her a &#8220;b&#8211;ch&#8221; and suggesting that he and Taylor &#8220;might still have sex.&#8221; He also portrayed her nude as a mannequin in a music video.</p>



<p>When Taylor clearly objected, Kim Kardashian pretty famously released a heavily edited audio recording of a call with Taylor. The edit seemed to suggest that Taylor was fine with the lyrics and had merely felt <em>uncomfortable </em>with Ye&#8217;s song.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-1024x710.jpg" alt="Joe Alwyn on October 19, 2024." class="wp-image-511501" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-768x533.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-2048x1421.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-960x666.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_joealwyn_04-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Alwyn attends the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures 4th Annual Gala in Partnership with Rolex at Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on October 19, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When the full audio later became public, it was clear that Taylor had not received all of the information. By that point, Kim had capitalized on other blowback and Taylor&#8217;s state of overexposure &#8212; so the truth came too late.</p>



<p>Those were Kim&#8217;s actions and hers alone. She was defending her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/kanye-west-threatening-to-release-new-album-major-labels-dont-want-to-touch-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awful husband</a>, though thankfully the two are no longer married.</p>



<p>What does it have to do with Kendall Jenner? Simply put, the Kardashian family&#8217;s habit of circling the wagons means that warring with one of them means warring with all of them. Which means that Kim&#8217;s enemies generally become everyone else&#8217;s within the family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-a-message-to-taylor-swift">Is this a message to Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>All that we can reasonably say with certainty is that Joe Alwyn taking a cozy pic with Kendall Jenner had to be a conscious choice. One can reasonably assume that he knew how people would react.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Taylor doesn&#8217;t care about the trickle-down feud with Kendall despite everything that Kim did to her. Joe isn&#8217;t her current boyfriend; he&#8217;ll always be part of her story, but he&#8217;s no longer part of her life.</p>



<p>Maybe he was stirring the pot with Swifties. But it seems more likely that the notoriously fame-shy actor was just posing for photos and isn&#8217;t trying to play any weird socio-political mind games.</p>

<p>Joe Alwyn is very much in the news these days.</p>



<p>But NOT because he once dated Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>The British actor is earning strong reviews for his role in the new movie Kinds of Kindess, but even during what may be the pinnacle of his career thus far&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; the topic of his ex-girlfriend just continues to be raised.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Sunday Times Style published on June 15, the 33-year old spoke in detail for pretty much the first time about how it feels to be known simply for having dated Swift.</p>



<p>The two were together, it must be emphasized, for SIX YEARS.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would think and hope that anyone and everyone can empathize,&#8221; Alwyn said in response to a question about The Tortured Poets Department and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/joe-alwyn-taylor-swift-album-connection/">songs on the album</a> many believe are about him.</p>



<p>“I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years.</p>



<p>&#8220;That is a hard thing to navigate,&#8221; Alwyn added.</p>

<p>Alwyn and Swift broke up last spring, a few months before she started to date <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/travis-kelce/">Travis Kelce</a>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been chatter that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/joe-alwyn-cheat-taylor-swift-eras-tour-clues-tortured-poets-department/">Alwyn cheated on the superstar</a>, but no real evidence to back it up. And Swift has never come out and said any such thing.</p>



<p>Referring to the incredible scrutiny over the breakup, Alwyn continued in this interview: </p>



<p>&#8220;What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it&#8217;s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.</p>



<p>&#8220;So you have something very real suddenly thrown into a very unreal space: tabloids, social media, press, where it is then dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition. </p>



<p>&#8220;And the truth is, to that last point, there is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said. I have made my peace with that.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-1024x768.jpg" alt="Joe Alwyn looks fancy" class="wp-image-502101" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-2048x1537.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-728x546.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-480x360.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-960x720.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-1080x810.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2153412831-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Alwyn attends the &#8220;Kinds Of Kindness&#8221; Red Carpet at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 17, 2024 in Cannes, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (GETTY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Adding that he and Swift &#8220;mutually&#8221; chose to &#8220;keep the more private details of our relationship private,&#8221; Alwyn said, &#8220;It was never something to commodify and I see no reason to change that now.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure the rising star would love to be known simply for his career at this point, but he seems to understand the situation.</p>



<p>While the actor noted that he is &#8220;in a really great place in my life, professionally and personally,&#8221; he also wouldn&#8217;t reveal whether or not he and his ex are still in touch &#8230; or whether he is dating someone new, telling the aforementioned outlet:</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can appreciate, given the level of noise and scrutiny about my past relationship why I wouldn&#8217;t want to just open the door to things like that right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many Swifties believe the new album&#8217;s track &#8220;So Long London,&#8221; is an nod to Taylor&#8217;s split from Alwyn. </p>



<p>The lyrics to another breakup song, &#8220;The Black Dog,&#8221; cite &#8220;some bar&#8221; of the same name, which appears to be a pub in London&#8217;s Vauxhall neighborhood.</p>



<p>However, Alwyn says in his latest interview that he&#8217;s &#8220;never been to Vauxhall.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mystery continues in that case, we suppose.</p>

<p>Did Joe Alwyn cheat on Taylor Swift ahead of their breakup?</p>



<p>By all accounts, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/joe-alwyn-taylor-swift-album-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe is dreading Taylor&#8217;s new album</a>. <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> is seemingly riddled with references to him, from the title to the tracklist and beyond. </p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all; Taylor may have used <em>The Eras Tour </em>to drop hints about their breakup as well.</p>



<p>Has Taylor already confirmed that Joe cheated on her? And will the new album double down on that? Here&#8217;s the easter eggs fans have dug up. Cue the receipts, proof,&nbsp;timelines,&nbsp;screenshots!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-taylor-swift-drop-hints-joe-alwyn-cheated-while-on-tour">Did Taylor Swift Drop Hints Joe Alwyn Cheated While On Tour?</h2>



<p>The news that Taylor and Joe ended their longtime romance was announced just as Taylor was kicking things off in the summer of 2023. </p>



<p>By the time she headed overseas, things started to get interesting. </p>



<p>As part of Taylor Swift&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-reunite-in-australia-attempt-low-key-date-at-sydney-zoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eras Tour run in Australia</a>, Taylor performed in Melbourne on February 17.</p>



<p>Her acoustic set included a mashup of three particular songs from three different albums.</p>



<p>&#8220;Getaway Car&#8221; is from <em>Reputation</em>, &#8220;August&#8221; is from <em>Folklore</em>, and &#8220;The Other Side of the Door&#8221; is from <em>Fearless (Taylor&#8217;s Version)</em>.</p>

<p>“So getaway car is from the perspective of the cheater, August is from the perspective of the other woman, and the other side of the door from the perspective of the woman who was cheated on,” speculated one Swiftie on social media.</p>



<p>Another pointed out that individual lyrics seem to point to some sort of &#8220;mess&#8221; involving another woman and &#8220;three&#8221; people total.</p>



<p>Maybe people are reading too much into it. But, at the same time, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/taylor-swift-drops-joe-alwyn-love-letter-invisible-string-from-tour-amidst-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor used songs to hint at the Joe Alwyn breakup</a> a year ago.</p>



<p>And then, at her Feb. 24 show in Sydney, Taylor performed another mashup consisting of the songs &#8220;Should&#8217;ve Said No&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re Not Sorry.&#8221; Even if you don&#8217;t  know the songs, the titles alone at least allude to cheating!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-tortured-poets-department-should-answer-a-lot-of-questions">&#8216;The Tortured Poets Department&#8217; should answer a lot of questions</h2>



<p>After once again making Grammy Awards history, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-new-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift announced her 11th studio album</a>, <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> at the 2024 show.</p>



<p>Obviously, this project was long in the works, yet still secret. Taylor will release her new album on April 19.</p>



<p>And Swifties fully expect that the album will shed light upon her split with Joe Alwyn. After all, the two were in a very serious, very private relationship for six years.</p>



<p>But everything about the album screams Joe Alwyn, without even hearing a single song from it. Start with the title. Many fans believe it&#8217;s a riff off the title of a group chat Joe admitted he&#8217;s in with Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott&nbsp;called “The Tortured Man Club.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there is a tracklist, which reads like the most blistering breakup album of all time.  Some of the song titles? &#8220;My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,&#8221; &#8220;Guilty as Sin?,&#8221; &#8220;So Long, London&#8221;! That last one, c&#8217;mon!</p>



<p>Even the album cover has fans convinced this one is going to be about their breakup. In a black-and-white shot of her lying in bed, Swift may be making a direct reference to the cheating allegations without saying a single word. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-joe-alwyn-cheating-rumors-how-did-they-start">The Joe Alwyn Cheating Rumors: How Did They Start?</h2>



<p>In the spring of 2023, Emma Laird shared a photo on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrMOLCgveV0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> of herself and Joe Alwyn. The two were costars in <em>Brutalist</em>.</p>



<p>Rumors quickly emerged that he had moved on from Taylor and gotten with her.</p>



<p>Some Swifties speculated that the timeline was not as smooth and sequential as that. Without evidence, fans wondered if Joe had cheated.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-has-yet-to-confirm-literally-any-of-this">Taylor has yet to confirm literally any of this</h2>



<p>Many of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/taylor-swift-terrified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="195">Taylor Swift&#8217;s fans</a> have spoken against these rumors. It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re defending Joe Alwyn &#8212; it&#8217;s that they don&#8217;t like hearing unfounded accusations, or hearing fans put words into Taylor&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>By all accounts, the actual reason for Taylor and Joe&#8217;s split had to do with their busy schedules, with Taylor&#8217;s massive level of fame (contrasting with Joe&#8217;s fondness for privacy), and just growing apart as couples sometimes do.</p>



<p>Until Taylor Swift <em>herself </em>says that Joe Alwyn is a cheat, a lot of people aren&#8217;t prepared to believe it.</p>

<p>Joe Alwyn cannot be looking forward to the new Taylor Swift album.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-album-tortured-poets-department/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce has heard the new Taylor Swift album</a>, the rest of us have to wait until April 19.</p>



<p>Fans are eager to hear the new LP. But there are a few people who are considerably less eager.</p>



<p>Joe Alwyn was Taylor&#8217;s long time partner for years. Now they&#8217;re exes, and even her new album&#8217;s title is a clear nod to him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-one-person-not-excited-for-the-new-taylor-swift-album-is-joe-alwyn">The one person not excited for the new Taylor Swift album is Joe Alwyn</h2>



<p>Truth be told, Joe Alwyn was always going to be a topic on <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>. And he&#8217;s not looking forward to it.</p>



<p>An inside source spoke to <em>Life &amp; Style</em> about <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/joe-alwyn-is-bracing-himself-amid-new-taylor-swift-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Alwyn dreading Taylor&#8217;s album</a>, saying that, “It’s safe to say that Joe is bracing himself for a lot of questions.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider then added that &#8220;No one is safe. Joe should be worried about what she reveals.&#8221;</p>

<p>For more than six years, Taylor and Joe were dating. It was a serious, long-term relationship. They broke up less than a year ago &#8212; in April of 2023.</p>



<p>It is easy to imagine that Taylor has scheduled her new album&#8217;s release for April as a reference to that. But <em>perhaps </em>it is just a coincidence. (Does anyone believe that)</p>



<p>Taylor and Joe were relatively quiet while they were dating. They have both remained fairly quiet since their split &#8230; but with her new album, Taylor likely aims to change that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-announced-her-new-album-at-the-grammys">Taylor announced her new album at the Grammys</h2>



<p>On Sunday, February 4, Taylor took to the stage to accept a very auspicious award.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is my 13th grammy. Which is my lucky number, I don’t know if I’ve ever told you that,” Taylor dished on stage.</p>



<p>“I wanna say thank you to the fans by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two years,&#8221; she teased. &#8220;Which is that my brand new album comes out April 19. It’s called<em> The Tortured Poets Department.”</em></p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of Taylor&#8217;s announcement, Swifties &#8212; and even more chill fans &#8212; were positively jumping with joy.</p>



<p>But what does the title, <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, mean?</p>



<p>The answer may have a lot to do with Joe Alwyn. And that knowledge presumably has him in a state of panic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-call-it-the-tortured-poets-department">Why call it The Tortured Poets Department?</h2>



<p>Swifties on social media have pointed to a <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/features/joe-alwyn-paul-mescal-sex-scenes-intimacy-coordinators-1235451466/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 2022 interview</a> that Joe Alwyn did for <em>Variety</em>&#8216;s Actors on Actors segment.</p>



<p>Joe shared that he and Paul Mescal had a group chat called &#8220;The Tortured Man Club.&#8221; That name is conspicuously familiar.</p>



<p>The two men were not the only members of the chat. We don&#8217;t really know about the private chat&#8217;s contents &#8230; but some fans wonder if we&#8217;re going to learn more very soon.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that fans don&#8217;t know why Taylor and Joe split. We&#8217;ve never heard an explanation from either of them.</p>



<p>Many fans assumed that &#8220;You&#8217;re Losing Me&#8221; was about their breakup, but &#8230; Taylor wrote that in December of 2021. They stayed together for more than a year after that.</p>



<p>Either Taylor was considering a breakup at the time when she wrote the song &#8230; or fans misunderstood the context of the song.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surely-joe-alwyn-won-t-be-the-only-tracklist-target">Surely Joe Alwyn won&#8217;t be the only tracklist target</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t know how much (if any) of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/taylor-swift-and-matty-healy-split-dirtbag-summer-is-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s dirtbag summer romance with Matty Healy</a> will make it into this album. It&#8217;s been in the works for a while.</p>



<p>But people will grumble about whatever music she puts out. These are folks who resent her Travis Kelce romance. Even this historic Grammy win had people grumbling and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/ariana-grande-brother-frankie-shading-taylor-swift-celine-dion-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shading Taylor</a> in the aftermath.</p>



<p>Most of Taylor&#8217;s fans are excited. And <em>most </em>of the people who aren&#8217;t don&#8217;t mind just skipping her music, instead of raging when a sportsball camera pans to her in a crowd.</p>

<p>It is no longer a secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-its-all-over-after-6-years/">Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are over</a>. Given that she is one of the most visible musicians on the planet, it is a surprise that this split remained under wraps for even a few days.</p>



<p>Six years was a good run. Reports about how they broke up have only reinforced the impression that their romance was great while it lasted.</p>



<p>Taylor has made a career out of expressing herself through music. At times, she reveals new things to fans through lyrics.</p>



<p>And right now, it&#8217;s looking like she was using music to hint at this breakup, publicly, a full <em>week </em>before the news broke.</p>

<p>Many of Taylor Swift&#8217;s songs are about specific people in her life. Obviously, a number of them are exes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Invisible String&#8221; is, famously, a love letter to Joe Alwyn. He was her boyfriend for more than half a decade.</p>



<p>Taylor is currently on tour. Even late last month, fans noticed that they weren&#8217;t hearing that song when they expected to.</p>

<p>On March 31, Taylor did not perform &#8220;Invisible String&#8221; to the massive crowd at her Eras Tour show in Arlington, Texas.</p>



<p>Instead, she switched it out for &#8220;The 1.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fans on social media are connecting the dots. Taylor was, in essence, dropping hints about her breakup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-468391" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463264798-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA &#8211; FEBRUARY 05: Taylor Swift attends the 65th GRAMMY Awards on February 05, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>On Twitter, Tumblr, and TikTok, Taylor&#8217;s fans have been pointing out that she pulled off this switcharoo right before the yes of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;The 1&#8221; is not about a soulmate, but about how it &#8220;would have been fun&#8221; if someone had &#8220;been the one.&#8221;</p>



<p>Replacing a love letter to Joe Alwyn with a wistful farewell song &#8230; for a hint, it&#8217;s not that subtle.</p>

<p>One TikToker cracked an Easter weekend joke: &#8220;This was not the Easter egg I was hoping for this weekend.&#8221;</p>



<p>In certain media, particularly video games, an &#8220;easter egg&#8221; is a colloquial term for a little cameo, inside joke, or even a hint or clue that some people will find and others will not.</p>



<p>Solid pun. The kind that you can really only make one time of year. They saw their opportunity, and they ran with it.</p>

<p>Despite numerous reports from extremely credible sources about the breakup, some Swifties were initially in denial.</p>



<p>Some folks do not delve into the world of entertainment news except for one or two faves. To them, they might not know the difference between <em>TMZ </em>and <em>People </em>and, say, less credible tabloids that we could name if we chose to.</p>



<p>To some of these fans, Taylor&#8217;s change in her tour tracklist did more to show them that the relationship was over than any reports by <em>Page Six</em> did.</p>

<p>We learned over the weekend that Taylor and Joe split.</p>



<p>Reports have repeatedly emphasized that this was a low-drama (or even no-drama) breakup.</p>



<p>The split went down a few weeks ago. And it sounds like, as far as breakups go, there are no hard feelings.</p>

<p>So, what happened?</p>



<p>Well, these are two busy, working adults who spent six years in a relationship.</p>



<p>Over time, they changed, they grew, and they grew apart. Some relationships naturally come to an end.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-1024x713.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-265180" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-1536x1069.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-2048x1425.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-735x512.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-335x233.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-347x242.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-520x362.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-640x445.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/a-funny-tidbit-1080x752.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Per IMDB: His American accent in Billy Lynn&#8217;s Long Halftime Walk was so convincing that his co-star Steve Martin had no idea he was from England until a few weeks into production.

<p>Taylor and Joe first met in 2016, at the Met Gala. Cara Delevigne introduced the two, and they hit things off in secret.</p>



<p>They only went public in 2017. Taylor was going through a public relations rough patch at the time, after Kim Kardashian exploited Taylor&#8217;s existing over-exposure. They were together through thick and thin.</p>



<p>Perhaps we will know more about this breakup in the near future. But it also doesn&#8217;t sound like there&#8217;s that much to it. Our best bet for details will be the content of Taylor&#8217;s future music.</p>

<p>After more than five years of dating, <a href="/2018/12/taylor-swift-engaged-to-joe-alwyn/">Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn</a> are officially engaged!</p>
<p>We&#8217;d say this is exciting news for all you Swifties out there, but really this is such a big deal that we&#8217;re <em>all</em> Swifties today!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Rumors that Joe had popped the question began to circulate last month after he and Taylor took a romantic low-key trip to Cornwall in his native England.</p>
<p>Of course, Taylor is a very private person &#8211; except when it comes to her songwriting! &#8211; so details will probably be hard to come by until her next album drops.</p>
<p>Speaking of songwriting, one way in which Joe is different from any of Taylor&#8217;s previous partners is that he&#8217;s been credited as a collaborator on her work.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Using the alias&nbsp;William Bowery, Alwyn co-wrote several tracks on Swift&#8217;s <em>Folklore</em> and <em>Evermore</em> albums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe plays piano beautifully and he&rsquo;s always just playing and making things up and kinda just creating things,&rdquo; Taylor shared in the recent Disney+ film, <em>Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Hey, this could be really weird and we could hate this, [but] because we&rsquo;re in quarantine and there&rsquo;s nothing else going on, could we just try to write this song together?&#8217;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Taylor went on to say that she felt Joe had made a uniquely valuable contribution to her creative process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it sounded really good from a masculine perspective, and it seemed to be an apology,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written so many songs from a female&rsquo;s perspective of wanting a male apology that we decided to make it from a teenage boy&rsquo;s perspective apologizing after he loses the love of his life because he&rsquo;s been foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The gratitude continued at the 2021 Grammys, where Taylor shouted out Joe in her&nbsp;Album of the Year acceptance speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, who is the first person that I sing every single song that I write,&rdquo; she told the audience, adding that she had &ldquo;so much fun writing songs in quarantine&rdquo; with his help.</p>
<p>For years, fans and the media have been clamoring for updates on the couple&#8217;s love story, but both Taylor and Joe have remained tight-lipped on the topic of their relationship.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>When <a href="/2018/09/joe-alwyn-finally-opens-up-about-dating-taylor-swift/">asked about his love life</a> while promoting new film and television projects, Alwyn has always gracefully steered the conversation back toward his acting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware people want to know about that side of things,&quot; he told<em> British Vogue</em> during a 2018 interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have been successfully very private, and that has now sunk in for people but I really prefer to talk about work.&quot;</p>

<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s not easy getting information from these two. (Or getting anything out of <a href="/2022/02/jake-gyllenhaal-finally-responds-to-taylor-swifts-all-too-well/">Jake Gyllenhaal for that matter</a>.)</p>
<p>In fact, there&#8217;s a good chance that we won&#8217;t find out about the wedding until after Joe and Taylor have exchanged vows.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that those who know her best say that they&#8217;ve never seen Swift happier.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;Joe is always telling Taylor that she&rsquo;s the most beautiful woman he&rsquo;s ever met,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-engaged-after-5-years-together/">a source</a> close to the situation tells Life &amp; Style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside and out.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good enough for us. As much as they might prefer to glory in every juicy detail of this story book romance, for now, that&#8217;ll have to be good enough for Taylor&#8217;s army of adoring fans.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;re sure there will be new music with lyrics to dissect in search of hidden meanings soon enough!</p>
<p>Our sincere congrats go out to Taylor and Joe!</p>
