<p>By now, you&#8217;ve very likely heard the news:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/gisele-bundchen-pregnant-3rd-baby/">Gisele Bundchen is pregnant</a> with her third child.</p>



<p>The news has come as somewhat of a shock to many observers because she only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-finalizes-divorce-from-tom-brady-extends-goats-historic-losing-streak/">finalized her divorce from Tom Brady</a> two years ago.</p>



<p>How has she moved on so quickly? To the point where she&#8217;s expecting another man&#8217;s child?!?</p>

<p>That man is named <strong>Joaquim Valente</strong> &#8212; and he&#8217;s been in Gisele&#8217;s life for quite awhile.</p>



<p>A fitness instructor from whom Bundchen has been taking jiu-jitsu lessons, Valente was first referenced by the supermodel in early 2022.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel stronger, more confidence and empowered since I started practicing self-defense,&#8221; the 44-year-old captioned an Instagram video at the time of her working out with Valente. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel it’s an important skill for all, but specially for us women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanking her future lover and his two brothers back then &#8212; who together founded the self-defense academy, Valente Brothers &#8212; for &#8220;being awesome teachers and for making training so much fun,&#8221; Gisele added: </p>



<p>&#8220;I am looking forward to keep improving. Let’s go!&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been speculation that Gisele was involved with Valente before actually splitting from Brady.</p>



<p>But we cannot confirm or deny such chatter.</p>

<p>Joaquim, meanwhile, is a self-defense and jiu-jitsu instructor who founded the Miami-based self-defense academy with his two siblings after moving to the United States from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. </p>



<p>He&#8217;s 35 years old and has been practicing jiu-jitsu since he was two years old, having received his black belt and Professors&#8217; Diploma from Grandmaster Hélio Gracie in 2007, according to the Valente Brothers website.</p>



<p>Bundchen met Valente through her son, Benjamin Brady, who was enrolled in one of his jiu-jitsu classes. </p>



<p>Shortly after, Gisele explained that the fitness instructor convinced her to join a session as well. And the romance blossomed from there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Initially, I wasn&#8217;t even considering it for myself,&#8221; she told Dust magazine in 2022. &#8220;But when I brought Ben to the first class and started talking to Joaquim, I realized that it was much more than self defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bundchen has mostly kept the details of this relationship private, although she told Vanity Fair last year of the three brothers who founded the aforementioned academy:</p>



<p>“I’m so grateful to know all of them because not only have they helped me and helped my kids, but they have become great friends, and Joaquim especially.”</p>



<p>She also shared why Joaquim is such a great person to have around her children.</p>



<p>“He’s our teacher and, most importantly, he’s a person that I admire and that I trust,&#8221; the beauty continued. &#8220;It’s so good to have that kind of energy, to have my kids around that type of energy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Brady has a new baby, why shouldn’t his ex!</p>



<p>Gisele Bündchen, supermodel mom and the famous QB’s ex wife is pregnant with her 3rd child!</p>



<p>The news comes as quite a shock to many given that it’s been just over a year since her split from Tom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, there was clearly no time to waste in getting serious with her younger boyfriend &#8211; so congrats are in order!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gisele-bundchen-pregnant-at-44">Gisele Bündchen Pregnant At 44</h2>



<p>The news broke on October 28, with  a source close to Gisele confirming the news to <em>People</em>.</p>



<p>Gisele, 44, and boyfriend Joaquim Valente, 35, are expecting their <a href="https://people.com/gisele-buendchen-is-expecting-first-baby-with-boyfriends-joaquim-valente-8672246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first baby</a> together and they couldn’t be happier. </p>



<p>&#8220;Gisele and Joaquim are happy for this new chapter in their life and they&#8217;re looking forward to creating a peaceful and loving environment for the whole family,&#8221; the source told <em>People</em> in a statement.</p>



<p>So far, neither Gisele or Joaquim have made an official statement on the matter, but it will only be a matter of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, their baby will be Gisele’s 3rd and the Jiu-Jitsu instructor’s first. Gisele already welcomed two kids with Tom: son Benjamin Rein, 14, and daughter Vivian Lake, 11.</p>



<p>However, there was a time when Gisele almost welcomed a 3rd child with Tom instead. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-baby-with-tom-was-once-in-the-cards"><strong>Another Baby With Tom Was Once In The Cards</strong></h2>



<p>When rumors of Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen heading for a divorce started circulating, so did talk of how the two could save their marriage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2016 (yes, that’s how long their romance was on “the rocks,” insiders claimed that both he and Gisele were worried about how their marriage would hold up in the absence of Tom&#8217;s one true love: football.</p>



<p>Obviously, their fears were well founded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back then, the story went that Gisele was reportedly worried that Tom would struggle with life as a house husband in retirement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, there was no way for her to know back then that he’d find anyway he could to stay in the game &#8211; like buy a minority stake in the Oakland Raiders, hence the “baby” comment earlier &#8211; but the game plan was to hopefully replace the roller coaster ride of victory and defeat with the thrill of sleeping through the night and the agony of changing poopy diapers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, insiders insisted<a href="http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2016/gisele-bundchen-pregnant-desperate-to-save-tom-brady-marriage-will-baby-prevent-divorce/?utm_source=MediaVine&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TrafficExchange_March"> Gisele was trying to get pregnant</a> with the couple&#8217;s third child.</p>



<p>In fact, for a while there were some who insisted she did in fact get pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <em>OK! </em>magazine, Gisele&#8217;s hair was the dead giveaway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their report suggested that Bundchen&#8217;s friends noticed how meticulous she is about coloring her hair, except when she&#8217;s pregnant.</p>



<p>She&#8217;d reportedly been neglecting her roots, which the insiders said was a sure sign that she was either expecting or hoping to get knocked up.</p>



<p>As we know, that never came to pass, but we’ll certainly now be keeping an eye on her hair to see if this new rumor is true!</p>

<p>Gisele Bundchen could be remarrying sooner than anyone thinks.</p>



<p>She and Tom Brady have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/gisele-bundchen-im-glad-tom-brady-retired-but-we-are-never-ever-getting-back-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been over</a> for a while now. They finalized their divorce in 2022.</p>



<p>Since that time, they have both moved on in their romantic lives.</p>



<p>In Gisele&#8217;s case, things are already serious enough that wedding bells could be in her very near future.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gisele-bundchen-could-be-remarrying-sooner-than-anyone-thought">Gisele Bundchen could be remarrying sooner than anyone thought</h2>



<p>According to what an inside source <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/gisele-bundchen-and-joaquim-valente-planning-low-key-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tells</a> <em>Life &amp; Style</em>, 2025 is going to be a major year for Gisele Bundchen. And, of course, for her boyfriend, jiujitsu (that&#8217;s the specific Brazilian martial art) instructor Joaquim Valente.</p>



<p>“Gisele and Joaquim are planning a low-key wedding at her Costa Rica estate,” the insider dished.</p>



<p>According to the source, the remote location is key. “She wants to do it far away from prying eyes,&#8221; the insider then explained.</p>

<p>As for the details of the reported wedding plans, Gisele shares two children with her ex, Tom Brady.</p>



<p>Benjamin is 14. Vivian is 11. Both would be there. So, too, would her former stepson, 16-year-old Jack Brady.</p>



<p>The report even dished that Jack&#8217;s mother, Bridget Moynahan, could be in attendance. </p>

<p>Reportedly, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-wedding-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="14">wedding plans</a> even include her wardrobe. That <em>is </em>pretty central to almost any wedding, after all.</p>



<p>The source said that Gisele Bundchen will be remarrying while wearing something &#8220;white and sexy&#8221; that her daughter helped to select.</p>



<p>“The ceremony is expected to be mostly in their native Portuguese, with a little English,” the insider detailed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gisele-bundchen-has-a-specific-vision-for-her-future-wedding">Gisele Bundchen has a specific vision for her future wedding</h2>



<p>“Lots of flowers, fruit, fish,&#8221; the source then elaborated.</p>



<p>&#8220;The whole event is going to be very tropical,&#8221; she insider characterized.</p>



<p>Finally, the source specified: She also wants a brigadeiro cake, which is famous in Brazil!” Though Brazilian food has the equal and opposite reputation of British food, the brigadeiro cake is rich and chocolatey and could be delicious for anyone who enjoys chocolate cake.</p>



<p>Obviously, we cannot confirm whether these alleged plans are true. However, it sounds like a lovely time.</p>



<p>Gisele and Joaquim reportedly hooked up in June of 2023. This was eight months after she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-finalizes-divorce-from-tom-brady-extends-goats-historic-losing-streak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="13">finalized her divorce from Tom Brady</a>, so it&#8217;s no rebound.</p>



<p>As for possible weird vibes with the ex, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/gisele-bundchen-is-so-darn-angry-at-tom-brady-over-that-roast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Brady probably won&#8217;t be there</a> when she remarries. But since they&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/tom-brady-new-girlfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both moved on</a>, remarrying shouldn&#8217;t ignite a firestorm, either.</p>

<p>According to a couple new reports, Gisele Bundchen is very unhappy over the material that was aired live on Netflix this past Sunday night.</p>



<p>Which does make a lot of sense.</p>



<p>When you stop to consider there were jokes made about the model&#8217;s boyfriend sticking his tongue up her rear end.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="716" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-1024x716.jpg" alt="Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen back in the day" class="wp-image-499425" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-1024x716.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-768x537.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-2048x1432.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-960x671.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-1080x755.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147437538-1200x839.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen attend The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In case you missed it, the aforementioned streaming service aired <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/tom-brady-divorce-qb-gets-roasted-over-gisele-split-over-and-over-and-over-again/">a roast of Tom Brady</a> this week.</p>



<p>And while the handsome quarterback was mocked for his involvement in a crypto scheme, along with his strange diet and connection to a controversial personal trainer&#8230; it was Brady&#8217;s failed marriage to Bundchen that most presenters/comedians focused on during the three-hour special.</p>



<p>Most notably, many of the stars on stage made references to how Gisele is allegedly dating her jujitsu intructor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eight f–king karate classes a day?&#8221; Kevin Hart quipped about how Brady should have realized something was going on. </p>



<p>&#8220;Eight karate classes a day… and she’s still a white belt. The only bruises she had were on her ass. Everyone should have known.&#8221;</p>

Cox/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A source now tells In Touch Weekly that Gisele may not be a huge fan of those who exposed her personal life in such a manner &#8212; but she&#8217;s <em>especially</em> angry at her ex-husband.</p>



<p>&#8220;She’s livid with Tom for even agreeing to doing it,” ​an told this tabloid on Monday, May 6, explaining Gisele&#8217;s reasoning as follows:</p>



<p>“He knew the jokes would be cruel and aimed at his marriage and at her, but he did it anyway. She blames Tom for not even taking her or their children into consideration.&#8221; </p>



<p>The former spouses share two children, son ​Benjamin, 14, and daughter Vivian, 11; both of whom are definitely old enough to search the Internet or watch Netflix and learn of these raunchy jokes.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="951" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-951x1024.jpg" alt="Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen from awhile ago" class="wp-image-499423" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-951x1024.jpg 951w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-279x300.jpg 279w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-768x827.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-1902x2048.jpg 1902w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-892x960.jpg 892w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-1003x1080.jpg 1003w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-955852846-1114x1200.jpg 1114w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen attend Heavenly Bodies: Fashion &amp; The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 7, 2018 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The jokes hit below the belt any they made it look like Gisele cheated, which she’s been desperately trying to deny. I know she has a temper and I’m sure she called Tom and let him have it,” the source went on.</p>



<p>Indeed, by all accounts, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-finalizes-divorce-from-tom-brady-extends-goats-historic-losing-streak/">Bundchen and Brady split</a> because the latter kept playing football, seemingly making it a priority over his family.</p>



<p>She did not cheat.</p>



<p>People Magazine, meanwhile, has quoted its own source, who says Gisele is “deeply disappointed by the disrespectful portrayal of her family on Sunday evening’s roast show.”</p>

<p>We can understand where Gisele is coming from.</p>



<p>Just consider what Nikki Glaser had to say during her segment: </p>



<p>“The only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast is when you said, ‘Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.</p>



<p>&#8220;How much must it suck knowing that your ex-wife’s new boyfriend can beat your ​ass while eating hers? That’s got to be terrible.”</p>



<p>Yeah. Gotta be awkward to know your son definitely heard that joke.</p>

<p>Tom Brady is one of the best looking people on the planet and is, almost indisputably, the best football player in the history of the universe.</p>



<p>It therefore seemed confusing to many observers when it was announced by Netflix that it would air The Greatest Roast of All Time, a live comedy special dedicated toward various celebrities simply <em>trashing</em> the quarterback.</p>



<p>What is there to even trash, right?</p>

<p>As this Tom Brady roast aired on Sunday night, the answer became obvious:</p>



<p>Brady&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/gisele-bunchen-breaks-down-over-tom-brady-divorce/">divorce from Gisele Bundchen</a>.</p>



<p>The athlete and the supermodel <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-finalizes-divorce-from-tom-brady-extends-goats-historic-losing-streak/">split in 2022</a>, with Gisele stating at the time:</p>



<p>With much gratitude for our time together, Tom and I have amicably finalized our divorce,” the iconic fashion and beauty mogul wrote.</p>



<p>“My priority has always been and will continue to be our children whom I love with all my heart. </p>



<p>&#8220;We will continue to [co-parent] to give then the love, care and attention they greatly deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>The former spouses appear to be on good terms&#8230; but Gisele also appears to be dating her karate instructor.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s just say this made for A LOT of material at the aforementioned roast.</p>



<p>The presenters were merciless.</p>



<p>Aside from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kim-kardashian-tom-brady-roast/">Kim Kardashian getting booed on stage</a>, the many (many!) jokes at Brady&#8217;s expenses over his break-up and over Gisele&#8217;s alleged new romance have dominated the headlines ever since this special wrapped up.</p>

<p>Kevin Hart referenced how Brady left the New England Patriots and head coach Bill Belichick and said:</p>



<p><em>You sometimes got to f&#8211;k your coach. You know who else f&#8211;ked they coach? Gisele. She f&#8211;ked that karate man… One of the smartest quarterbacks to ever play the game, how did you not see this coming? </em></p>



<p><em>Eight f&#8211;king karate classes a day? Eight karate classes a day… and she&#8217;s still a white belt. The only bruises she had were on her ass. Everyone should have known.</em></p>

<p>Said Jeff Ross:</p>



<p><em>Give it up for the lord of the Super Bowl rings, my friend, Tom Brady. A man who has so many rings he could melt them down and forge a sword to go on a quest and get Gisele back from that jiu-jitsu teacher.</em></p>



<p>Joked Drew Bledsoe:</p>



<p><em>Look, buddy, you have more rings than I do, but I&#8217;ve experienced a couple things that you will never experience. The feeling of being the No. 1 overall draft pick in the NFL… and a 28th wedding anniversary, it was yesterday</em>.</p>



<p>Nikki Glaser made the room gasp with:</p>



<p><em>Tom, the only thing dumber than you saying yes to this roast was when you said, &#8216;Hey babe, you should try jiu-jitsu.&#8217; That&#8217;s gotta suck. How much would it suck &#8212; oh my God, just knowing your ex-wife&#8217;s new boyfriend can beat your ass while eating hers</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="692" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-1024x692.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-499220" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-768x519.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-2048x1383.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-960x648.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-1080x729.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-678060884-1200x810.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen attend the &#8220;Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art Of The In-Between&#8221; Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 1, 2017 in New York City.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for People.com)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ll give the final hilarious and brutal word to Andrew Schulz:</p>



<p><em>Tom, you became the GOAT by becoming the fiercest competitor on the planet. Tom was once asked which one of his rings was his favorite and he said, &#8216;The next one.&#8217; Sorry, that&#8217;s a Gisele quote. My bad. That was Gisele, that was Gisele, for sure</em>.</p>



<p><em>You remind us that no matter how big you get, how successful you are, how much you accomplish in your life, you can always end up a twice-divorced supplement salesman in Tampa, Florida</em>.</p>

<p>They were one of the most famous couples in the world.</p>



<p>And yet&#8230; in the wake of their divorce, we&#8217;ve barely heard a word from Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady &#8212; at least when it comes to their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-finalizes-divorce-from-tom-brady-extends-goats-historic-losing-streak/">shocking split in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>In a new interview, however, the Brazilian supermodel gets honest about life after parting ways with the former NFL quarterback, to whom she was married for 13 years.</p>



<p>She spoke to ABC News&#8217; Robin Roberts for a chat that got released on March 7.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything I&#8217;ve experienced, it made me realize what I want and what I don&#8217;t want,&#8221; Gisele says in this sit-down, growing very emotional early on.</p>



<p>She even asks for a &#8220;moment&#8221; at one point&#8230; after Roberts mentions a quote Gisele once uttered about the &#8220;death of a dream.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you wish for that, you know?&#8221; Gisele later said of getting divorced. </p>



<p>&#8220;But I think sometimes in life things happen. I feel so blessed because, like, I wouldn&#8217;t change anything in my life. </p>



<p>&#8220;I had incredible experiences. I learned so much. I have my children, which are the biggest blessings in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, Gisele and Tom share a 14-year old son named Benjamin and an 11-year old daughter named Vivan.</p>



<p>By most accounts, the celebrities broke up because Brady insisted on playing football well into his 40s, presumably placing his job at the time over the interests of his wife and his family.</p>



<p>Even after Brady retired, though, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/gisele-bundchen-im-glad-tom-brady-retired-but-we-are-never-ever-getting-back-together/">Gisele did not want him back</a>.</p>



<p>There was also talk that the pair split <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-did-they-split-up-because-of-a-crypto-scam-gone-wrong/">due to a crypto scam</a>.</p>



<p>Fast forward to this week and Gisele says she&#8217;s in a &#8220;new season, a new chapter in my life, and I get to learn new things, and I get to walk my path in a different way, you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gisele &#8212; who is &#8220;grateful for every lesson&#8221; &#8212; also touched on the challenges of co-parenting with her ex.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s easier days than others. But it&#8217;s amazing that the kids — they&#8217;re super smart children,&#8221; Bündchen said, laughing. </p>



<p>&#8220;They know what they can get away with. </p>



<p>&#8220;So I think it&#8217;s natural that it has different rules, and kids just adapt and they&#8217;re going to try to do what they want. And I can only control what I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gisele has a new cookbook coming out and may step into the spotlight a bit more than usual over the next few weeks and months.</p>



<p>She is allegedly in a relationship with jiujitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, but did not comment on the romance in this interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think right now, really, my priority is my kids and creating this beautiful sanctuary for our family,&#8221; she concluded.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very committed to living my truth more than ever, so I would say that&#8217;s where my heart is now, where I am right now. I&#8217;m living my truth and I&#8217;m not apologizing for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the sports world gave a collective shrug in response to one of the least-shocking announcements of all time.</p>



<p>Last year around this time, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/tom-brady-stuns-nfl-comes-out-of-retirement-im-not-done-winning/">Tom Brady retired from the NFL</a>, then changed his mind and wound up playing a season that reminded the whole world that there are reasons you don&#8217;t see more 45-year-old football players.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/tom-brady-announces-retires-from-nfl-yet-again-will-gisele-take-him-back-now/">Brady retired again</a>, prompting fans everywhere to breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p>



<p>After all, the last thing this league needs is for one of the most celebrated athletes of all time to shatter a hip on the field at the age of 46.</p>

<p></p>



<p>That&#8217;s got &#8220;congressional investigation into whether or not anyone should be playing this brutal sport&#8221; written all over it.</p>



<p>We kid Tom, but there&#8217;s pretty much no denying that he&#8217;s the GOAT.</p>



<p>Within hours of his announcement just about everyone who had ever crossed paths with the guy had reacted to the news of his latest retirement &#8212; including his wife, Gisele Bundchen.</p>

<p>“Wishing you only wonderful things in this new chapter of your life,&#8221; Gisele commented on Tom&#8217;s retirement announcmement.</p>



<p>She even added some praying hands emojis, in case the &#8220;namaste&#8221; vibes weren&#8217;t already evident.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gisele moved on with her life quite a while ago and is happy about whatever Tom chooses to do with his life now,&#8221; the source says.</p>

<p>The insider adds that &#8220;the welfare and happiness of the children&#8221; remain her top priority. </p>



<p>Now, a source close to Gisele has spoken with People magazine and confirmed that the supermodel was not being passive-aggressive &#8212; she really does wish her ex all the best.</p>



<p>&#8220;Keeping a positive attitude about Tom and her career is part of what you do as a parent,&#8221; the insider says.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;They are sharing their kids and spreading the love between them so they grow up as normal kids with two caring parents.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source added that Gisele &#8220;is fine with his decisions but is not involved with them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, both Brady and Bundchen are &#8220;interested in keeping life as happy and normal as possible for the kids.&#8221; </p>

And Gisele is dropping clues about what happened. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>And other than <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/gisele-bundchen-remarrying-near-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="22">Tom&#8217;s relationship</a> with his children, Gisele is not particularly concerned about her ex&#8217;s these days, as she&#8217;s &#8220;extremely busy in her career and life&#8221; and &#8220;optimistic about her future.</p>



<p>There was speculation that Tom and Gisele might give their marriage another chance now that he&#8217;s left football behind.</p>



<p>After all, Tom&#8217;s refusal to retire in order to be a more present partner was reportedly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-details-of-their-billion-dollar-prenup-revealed/">Gisele&#8217;s main reason for filing for divorce</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen have called it quits after 13 years of marriage. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the insider says that Tom&#8217;s insistence on returning to the NFL was  &#8220;far from the only issue,&#8221; in their marriage. </p>



<p>However, it seems we shouldn&#8217;t hold our breath waiting for Gisele to go public with the other problemd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gisele likes to keep things positive,&#8221; the insider adds. </p>



<p>&#8220;She finds negativity to be toxic and she wants no part of it. She wants Tom to thrive. It&#8217;s beneficial for their kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>We agree &#8212; no kid deserves to see their dad bounced out of the first round of the playoffs by freakin Dak Prescott!</p>

<p>We won&#8217;t be celebrating Groundhog Day until tomorrow, but like Bill Murray in the cinematic masterpiece that bears the holiday&#8217;s name, you might already be experiencing feelings of <em>deja vu</em>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because football legend Tom Brady has once again announced his retirement from the NFL.</p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/tom-brady-stuns-nfl-comes-out-of-retirement-im-not-done-winning/">Brady first retired</a> around this time last year, but he quickly had a change of heart and decided to return for one last season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>



<p>No doubt the undisputed GOAT was hoping to add an eighth Super Bowl ring to his collection, but his competitors had other plans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461701" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1437117452-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady has broken his silence about his divorce. Not surprisingly, he says he&#8217;s focusing on football. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Instead of hoisting another Lombardi Trophy, Brady struggled through a rocky season that ended in disappointing fashion when his team was bounced from the playoffs with a lopsided loss against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>



<p>So it comes as no surprise that at the age of 45, Tom Terrific has decided to hang up his cleats.</p>



<p>For good, this time &#8230;</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m retiring. For good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I&#8217;d just press record, and let you guys know first,&#8221; an emotional Brady told fans in a video posted on Instagram Wedneday morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be long-winded, you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so. I…really thank you guys…so much to every single one of you, for supporting me, my family, my friends, teammates, my competitors,&#8221; Brady continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could go on forever. There&#8217;s too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing. Love you all,&#8221; he concluded.</p>



<p>Obviously, Brady is a future hall of famer and arguably the greatest to play the game at any position.</p>



<p>So the implications for the future of the NFL are huge.</p>



<p>But this is a gossip site, so let&#8217;s get into the question that matters most from the celebrity standpoint:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1024x680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-457798" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-735x488.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-520x345.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-640x425.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-960x638.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1080x717.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen went from separated to divorced in record time.

<p></p>



<p>Is it possible that Brady&#8217;s retirement announcement means that he and Gisele Bundchen will give their marriage another chance?</p>



<p>Well, despite reports that it was her frustration over Brady&#8217;s refusal to retire that led <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-details-of-their-billion-dollar-prenup-revealed/">Bundchen to file for divorce</a>, a reconciliation seems highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For one thing, Tom and Gisele are full-blown <em>divorced</em>, not separated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="780" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-1024x780.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-460536" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-1024x780.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-300x229.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-768x585.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-1536x1170.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-2048x1561.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-735x560.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-335x255.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-347x264.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-520x396.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-640x488.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-960x732.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1147446505-1080x823.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen have gone their separate ways. And Gisele has been dropping clues about what happened. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>These two didn&#8217;t go to the trouble of divvying up billions in assets and hammering out a custody arrangement just to call the whole thing off because Tom got embarrassed by Dak Prescott in the Wild Card round.</p>



<p>Plus, it&#8217;s important to bear in mind that Gisele never came out and said, &#8220;Yes, I left my husband because he&#8217;s addicted to winning Super Bowls.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tom&#8217;s refusal to make good on his promise to be a more present partner probably played a role in her decision, but there was almost certainly more going on beneath the surface.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="733" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1024x733.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-457481" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-300x215.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-768x550.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1536x1100.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-2048x1466.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-735x526.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-335x240.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-347x248.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-520x372.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-640x458.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-960x687.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1080x773.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gisele Bundchen was reportedly upset with Tom Brady&#8217;s decision to return to the NFL. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whatever the case, it&#8217;s almost certainly too late now.</p>



<p>Gisele has been taking vacations with her yoga instructor, and Tom is rumored to be dating model and influencer Veronika Rajek.</p>



<p>So today&#8217;s announcement is unlikely to change anything with regard to Brady and Bundchen&#8217;s relationship.</p>

<p></p>



<p>But don&#8217;t weep for Tom, who will reportedly be walking straight from the field into the broadcasting booth, having already signed a lucrative deal with Fox.</p>



<p>Instead save your sympathy for the jilted ex who&#8217;s been fantasizing for years about reconciling with Brady.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking, of course, about Bill Belichick.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>We hope enjoyed that brief two-week break from Gisele Bundchen-Tom Brady updates.</p>



<p>Because the former couple is back in the news in a big way today &#8212; and they&#8217;re bringing a couple of friends with them.</p>



<p>Gisele and Tom are now joined by former NFL wide receiver and noted crazy person Antonio Brown, who has spent the past several weeks gleefully posting about his ex-QB&#8217;s divorce.</p>



<p>But while some of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-says-shes-done-with-tom-brady-antonio-brown-taunts-goat-qb-on-instagram/">AB&#8217;s anti-Brady memes</a> have been darkly humorous, he really crossed the line with his latest trolling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As TMZ <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/22/antonio-brown-fake-gisele-nude-pic-bizarre-tom-brady-beef/">reports</a> Brown posted fake nude photos of Gisele on his Snapchat page today.</p>



<p>The pics didn&#8217;t stay up for very long, of course, but it was still an idiotic move from Brown, and we imagine the whole incident was rather humiliating for Gisele.</p>



<p>Brown also posted a doctored photo, in which Gisele appears to be posing with her arms around him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Antonio Brown&#8217;s Snapchat page is a very strange place. (Photo via Snapchat)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The weird thing about all of this is that the story of Brown&#8217;s bizarre NFL career would be much shorter were it not for the support that he received from Brady.</p>



<p>Most teams considered Brown persona non grata after multiple women accused him of sexual assault, but Brady used his considerable clout to get the wide receiver signed to both the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Bucs.</p>



<p>So we guess Tom is learning a valuable lesson about sticking his neck out to protect and enable abusers?</p>

Not surprisingly, he says he&#8217;s focusing on football. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, folks, everyone in this story is bad except for Gisele, who thankfully is winning this divorce in decisive fashion.</p>



<p>First, the media provided constant reminders that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/tom-brady-gisele-bundchens-net-worth-revealed-will-their-divorce-be-the-most-expensive-in-sports-history/"> Gisele&#8217;s net worth</a> is far greater than her ex&#8217;s.</p>



<p>And now, it looks as though Bundchen might have already moved on with a new boo.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="661" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1024x661.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-461471" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1024x661.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-300x194.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-768x496.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1536x991.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-2048x1322.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-735x474.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-335x216.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-347x224.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-520x336.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-640x413.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-960x620.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-452101014-1080x697.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen are officially divorced. The couple made the news official Friday morning. (Photo via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nothing has been confirmed yet, but Gisele has been spending an awful lot of time with her yoga instructor, Joaquim Valente.</p>



<p>Gisele and Joaquim even took a vacation to Costa Rica together, but sources close to the non-couple swear they&#8217;re just friends.</p>



<p>That may be true, but we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn that these two are hitting the mat and contorting themselves into all sorts of bonkers positions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1024x680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-457798" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-735x488.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-520x345.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-640x425.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-960x638.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-678061138-1080x717.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen went from separated to divorced in record time.

<p></p>



<p>Anyway, Gisele moved into her new digs in Miami beach this week, and there have been rumors that she&#8217;ll be living with Joaquim.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like that&#8217;s the case, but it&#8217;s worth noting that friends of Valente&#8217;s were spotted helping Bundchen move the last of her stuff.</p>



<p>Make of that what you will.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As for Tom, he&#8217;s gearing up for a matchup against the Browns this week.</p>



<p>And by that we mean he&#8217;s playing the Cleveland football team, not squaring off in a rumble against Antonio and entire his family.</p>



<p>Although honestly, that&#8217;s a possibility, too.</p>

<p>When the world learned that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/tom-brady-breaks-silence-on-divorce-gisele-who-i-have-to-focus-on-football/">Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen had divorced</a>, the news didn&#8217;t exactly come as a shock.</p>



<p>By that time, rumors of trouble within the A-listers&#8217; marriage had been circulating for weeks, and it was widely known that they&#8217;d been living in separate homes.</p>



<p>But we still don&#8217;t have a satisfactory explanation as to exactly <em>why</em> these two went their separate ways.</p>



<p>The most common theory is that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/gisele-bundchen-heres-the-real-reason-im-divorcing-tom-brady/"> Gisele was upset about Tom&#8217;s decision to return to the NFL</a> after announcing his retirement in February.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="733" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1024x733.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-457481" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-300x215.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-768x550.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1536x1100.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-2048x1466.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-735x526.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-335x240.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-347x248.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-520x372.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-640x458.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-960x687.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1131300592-1080x773.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Gisele Bundchen was reportedly upset with Tom Brady&#8217;s decision to return to the NFL. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But insiders close to Bundchen have repeatedly insisted that that&#8217;s not the case.</p>



<p>Now, a new theory has emerged that might explain both Brady&#8217;s decision to return to football, and the strife that ensued within his marriage.</p>



<p>Over the past week, the controversial cryptocurrency exchange FTX has gone bankrupt, and Tom is one of several celebs who has been mentioned in a class-action lawsuit from customers who feel they were swindled by founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Like Steph Curry, Shaquille O&#8217;Neal, and several other star athletes, Brady appeared in commercials encouraging crypto buyers to invest with FTX.</p>



<p>Many now believe that Gisele tried to discourage Brady from involving himself in such a shady enterprise.</p>



<p>These people also believe that Brady&#8217;s decision to return to football was motivated by finances &#8212; they claim that he lost millions as a result of his own crypto investments and needed to make some money back.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This is one of several theories that has arisen in response to Gisele&#8217;s claim that she did not divorce Tom as a result of his decision to come out retirement.</p>



<p>A different hypothesis holds that Bundchen was upset when she learned that Brady had entered secret talks with the Miami Dolphins in direct violation of his contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>



<p>The negotiations became the subject of an NFL investigation, which led to the suspension of Dolphins owner Stephen Ross who violated league rules by pursuing a deal with a player who was under contract with a new team.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Insiders have speculated that Bundchen became angry upon learning that Brady had entered these talks without her knowledge.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the couple&#8217;s divorce settlement has resulted in some embarrassing revelations about their finances.</p>



<p>The <em>New York Post </em>reports that despite having multiple humanitarian organizations named after them, Tom and Gisele donated less than 0.1 percent of their income to charity between 2007 and 2019.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The came as a shock to fans, as Gisele has claimed for years that she considers herself a philanthropist first and a model second.</p>



<p>“My life is devoted to this,” Bundchen once said in an interview with the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>. </p>



<p>“I know from the outside that people think, ‘This girl just poses for pictures.’ But in my head, I’m thinking the whole time, ‘Okay, if I take this job, then I can have more money to put into this [project],'&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that’s what I’m doing, because that’s [why] God gave me to do what I can do, right?”</p>



<p>Brady and Buncdhen might be the GOATs of their respective fields &#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; But apparently, when it comes to giving back, these two still have a lot to learn!</p>
