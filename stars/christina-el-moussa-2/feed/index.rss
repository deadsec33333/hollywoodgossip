<p>Christina Hall is having throuple vibes with the <em>unlikeliest </em>couple: Tarek and Heather El Moussa.</p>



<p>Tarek El Moussa and Christina Hall very famously divorced many years ago. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/christina-haack-divorce-joshua-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina&#8217;s divorce from Josh</a> is still fresh.</p>



<p>Tarek and Heather have their own life and relationship. They even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/heather-rae-young-and-tarek-el-moussa-welcome-first-child-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">welcomed a child</a> together.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of exes who work together amicably. But in this case, the chemistry is off the charts. Is Christina a third wheel or about to become her ex&#8217;s <em>third</em>?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-christina-hall-throuple-in-the-works-with-her-ex-and-his-wife">Is a Christina Hall throuple in the works with her ex and his wife?</h2>



<p>HGTV took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C__4s1gOT6P/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to share an endearing promo for <em>The Flip Off</em>. The short video features Tarek El Moussa, Heather Rae El Moussa, and Christina Hall &#8212; who was previously Christina Haack and, of course, Christina El Moussa.</p>



<p>In the promo, Tarek and El Moussa smile at the camera while embracing, as if posing for a photograph.</p>



<p>This is when Christina Hall pops up behind them. If this were a photo, she would be photo-bombing them. She then nudges into the frame, displacing the couple, and everyone seems to laugh.</p>

<p>What may be the most inspired choice about this video &#8212; aside from showcasing their unlikely yet seemingly easy on-screen chemistry &#8212; is the music.</p>



<p>The song is &#8220;Me, You, and Steve&#8221; by Garfunkel and Oates. The song, which often surfaces in fandom relationship discussions, describes a third wheel situation where the singer wonders if <em>they</em> are becoming the third wheel.</p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s finally me and you, and you and me, just us, and your friend Steve,&#8221; the song goes. Many of us have been the partner, the friend, or the obliviously happy person in the middle. Some have even played all three roles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-flip-off-all-about">What is &#8216;The Flip Off&#8217; all about?</h2>



<p>Originally, Christina Hall would have been partners with Josh Hall on <em>The Flip Off</em>. The Halls and the (current) El Moussas would have competed on purchasing, renovating, and selling a house for profit.</p>



<p>The competition would put a new twist on the now familiar house-flipping television genre. (Competition is part of the magic behind <em>Love It Or List It</em>, so it&#8217;s not a terrible idea)</p>



<p>But Josh filed for divorce in July. He and Christina are no longer going to be partners in life. Which gives <em>The Flip Off</em> a very different vibe &#8212; as we can see in the promos.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christina-haack-boyfriend-who-is-the-hgtv-star-dating-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina is dating Christopher Larocca</a>. But as far as we can tall, he&#8217;s not involved in the house-flipping game.</p>

<p>Josh is no longer going to be part of <em>The Flip Off</em>. But the show itself moved forward with this very new dynamic.</p>



<p>The thing about this specific subgenre of renovation shows is that the chemistry among the stars is paramount. Whether it&#8217;s people making that certain joke about the <em>Property Brothers </em>or watching a wholesome marriage or a toxic one.</p>



<p>Obviously, HGTV isn&#8217;t getting the &#8220;rival exes and their new partners&#8221; situation. But what they&#8217;re actually getting could end up being much better.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0">“I love this. Exes and coparents being adults,” one commenter praised on Instagram. “I’m glad they all get along! They’re civil adults and it’s healthy for the kids.”</p>



<p>Another clearly agreed: &#8220;Love that they can support each other professionally. Good role models for their kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>That said &#8230; not everyone seems enthused. Some don&#8217;t see the point in <em>The Flip Off</em> filming without Josh Hall to balance the teams. And others didn&#8217;t like the premise for the show to begin with.</p>

<p>Christina Hall is locked into an alimony struggle with her estranged ex.</p>



<p>Now going by Christina Haack, her maiden name, she has accused Josh Hall of demanding a colossal amount of spousal support amidst <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/christina-hall-throuple-tarek-el-moussa-heather-rae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their contentious divorce</a>.</p>



<p>Now, her soon-to-be former husband is firing back with his own version of things.</p>



<p>Josh Hall accuses Christina and her attorney of outright lying. But he&#8217;s not making these claims through traditional divorce channels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-alimony-is-josh-hall-demanding-of-christina-haack">What alimony is Josh Hall demanding of Christina Haack?</h2>



<p>According to the HGTV star, her ex has asked for an &#8220;outrageous&#8221; sum in monthly spousal support.</p>



<p>“Josh Hall is requesting $65,000 per month in spousal support from [Christina] on a 2 year, 9 month marriage which is outrageous when he is self-supporting,” <a href="https://people.com/christina-hall-haack-husband-josh-denies-asking-for-65000-per-month-in-spousal-support-8729710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documents</a> from Christina&#8217;s legal team read, according to <em>People</em>.</p>



<p>Christina went on to argue that Josh Hall &#8220;has no need for spousal support&#8221; on the grounds that he &#8220;just paid over $70,000 to pay off the lease&#8221; on a Bentley.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="829" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-829x1024.jpg" alt="Christina Haack in 2019." class="wp-image-511442" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-829x1024.jpg 829w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-243x300.jpg 243w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-768x949.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-1658x2048.jpg 1658w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-777x960.jpg 777w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-874x1080.jpg 874w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1018_christinahaack_01-972x1200.jpg 972w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christina Anstead attends 2019 Disney On Ice &#8220;Mickey&#8217;s Search Party&#8221; at Staples Center on December 13, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On Wednesday, October 16, Josh Hall fired back. He did not do this in court documents &#8230; but by way of his Instagram Story, of all places.</p>



<p>According to Josh Hall, Christina Haack&#8217;s legal arguments were &#8220;riddled with lies and assumptions.</p>



<p>He called out Matthew S. DeArmey, Christina&#8217;s divorce attorney, claiming that this was an &#8220;interesting tactic for someone who is a licensed attorney and took an oath of integrity. Pretty sure making provably false statements to a judge is unethical.&#8221; (Has there ever, in history, been someone who is fond of their ex&#8217;s divorce attorney?)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-josh-hall-also-filed-to-stop-christina-haack-from-selling-her-home">Josh Hall also filed to stop Christina Haack from selling her home</h2>



<p>Christina Haack had hoped to sell her $4.5 million home in Franklin, Tennessee.</p>



<p>However, Josh Hall has been living there. And he filed an emergency order not too long ago to try to prevent her from selling it.</p>



<p>According to Josh, he made a global settlement offer to Christina, but she turned that down, intending to sell her house. </p>

<p>According to the provisions of their previous agreement, Josh Hall had permission to live in the residence for 12 days last month &#8212; during which it was unoccupied.</p>



<p>According to Josh, however, Christina should have but did not obtain a court order for the sale of the home and also did not obtain his permission to sell it. (For the record, Christina Haack is the sole owner of the house)</p>



<p>Josh is no longer living there and has moved to another property in Tennessee. He alleges that he is &#8220;suffering prejudice&#8221; because his living expenses have increased.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-divorce-is-so-bitter">This divorce is so bitter</h2>



<p>Alimony is a complex topic. The concept exists so that a wealthy partner cannot (in theory) use their assets to control, extort, or keep a spouse from leaving them. Also so that the ex does not have to beg for support after leaving.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are valid arguments for why some exes require massive amounts of money. One common one is time &#8212; years or decades spent as a partner mean that they may have sacrificed career opportunities by devoting time to a now defunct relationship.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear how any of these situations apply to such a short marriage. Perhaps Josh Hall will have more to say soon. And maybe, this time, he&#8217;ll say it through his divorce attorney instead of by accusing an officer of the court of lying to a judge.</p>
