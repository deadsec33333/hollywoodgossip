										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>One year ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/alina-kasha-fired-edited-out-of-remaining-90-day-fiance-before-t/"><em>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</em> fired Alina Kasha</a> from Season 5.</p>



<p>Production even took the extraordinary step of editing her storyline out of the rest of the season. Not even convicted monster Geoffrey Paschel received that particular treatment.</p>



<p>Many fans had complicated feelings about this. Happy to see accountability for a racism scandal, but with real concerns about the motivations behind the backlash.</p>



<p>Now, on the anniversary of her scandal, Alina is addressing it all. And she says that she&#8217;s <em>happy </em>about what went down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alina Kasha shared this photo in January 2023. Projected onto the wall behind her, we can see attacks against her from social media. Some of them include ableist slurs. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Exactly 1 year ago I was tried to be canceled,&#8221; Alina Kasha began her recent Instagram caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;How did I remember this date?&#8221; she asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Weeell, it was a birthday of someone that I used to know (lol),&#8221; Alina explained, &#8220;and we celebrated it together.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;At night I opened my phone and saw first messages full of hate without really understanding what’s going on,&#8221; Alina recalled.</p>



<p>She noted that &#8220;the rest of the story you already know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alina&#8217;s history of using the N-word on social media as well as dressing as racist caricatures had come to light. The posts were not recent, but they were alarming.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;But you know, in the end, I’m happy it happened,&#8221; Alina surprisingly wrote. &#8220;It was a unique experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then asked her followers: &#8220;How many people do you personally know who were tried to be cancelled?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alina admitted: &#8220;Living thru such experience wasn’t always easy but it became extremely rewarding.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Learning to navigate it only taught me to be fearless,&#8221; Alina expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;It also taught me that what is going on online doesn’t really correlate with what’s happening in real life,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the end, I faced it, owned it, learned from it,&#8221; Alina listed. She &#8220;kept my head high.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">She&#8217;s waiting in her wheelchair to meet him for the first time. Thirteen years is a long time to know someone without seeing each other in person, and &#8230; it&#8217;s a cliffhanger, so we&#8217;ll have to wait until Episode 3.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alina wrote that she &#8220;got immense love and support from everyone &#8211; my family, friends, fans and just people from all over the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then admitted that &#8220;It surprised me how hypocritical &amp; narrow minded can people be.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But also,&#8221; Alina reflected, &#8220;how open minded or generous they might be.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I know I made a mistake and I’m really fine with it. I don’t blame myself for stupidness or ignorance…&#8221; Alina shared.</p>



<p>She shared that &#8220;it’s the opposite. I forgave myself. Everyone can screw up, including me, and THAT’S FINE.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alina then stated that &#8220;What matters is if we learn something from it.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Another thing that I want to highlight is that we had an amazing YouTube conversation with Dr. Honda (I recommend you to watch it!),&#8221; Alina continued.</p>



<p>She wrote that this conversation is something &#8220;for [which] I’m especially grateful.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alina added that &#8220;He also opened up my eyes on some things that never crossed my mind.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;This experience made the world that I see a bit uglier: I see more issues, unfairness, prejudices,&#8221; Alina noted.</p>



<p>&#8220;And at times,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;it makes me wanna go live in some other world when no one grew up in the systems that we grew up in.&#8221; That makes sense.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe happiness lies in being oblivious but I’d always choose a red pill,&#8221; Alina added. We should note that she is certainly making a <em>The Matrix</em> reference, rather than referring to the misogynistic ideology known as &#8220;redpill.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I often think when something happens to me &#8211; would it matter to me in a year?&#8221; Alina asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;This thought crossed my mind back then as well,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;My response: yes, it mattered.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alina then added: &#8220;But in an extremely enriching and grateful way.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>As we noted, there were bad faith elements to the callout of Alina Kasha. </p>



<p>Simply put, some people hated her because she&#8217;s a woman (a vocal segment of <em>90 Day Fiance</em> fans have a <em>huge </em>misogny problem) and for her disability.</p>



<p>And because she, as a disabled woman, &#8220;dared&#8221; to have sex on screen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It was particularly suspicious that the show <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/90-day-fiance-racism-scandals-why-wasnt-mike-berk-fired-like-ali/">did not fire Mike Berk</a> from the same season, even though his bigotry scandal was certainly worse. Mike is a native English speaker and an American, so a cultural misunderstanding seems unlikely.</p>



<p>Even so, all of the bad intentions in the world don&#8217;t mean that Alina&#8217;s use of racial slurs don&#8217;t matter. Of course they do.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad that Alina learned so much from her experience. It&#8217;s just a shame that it came too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Most of us were not surprised at <a href="/2022/04/caleb-greenwood-awkwardly-addresses-tell-all-absence-i-wish-my-c/">Caleb and Alina&#8217;s absence</a> from <a href="/slideshows/usman-umar-breaks-kimberly-menzies-heart-on-the-90-day-fiance-be/">the <em>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</em> Season 5 Tell All</a>.</p>
<p>Months ago, Alina&#8217;s old posts resurfaced, involving racist slurs. After outcry from fans, TLC edited out the couple&#8217;s storyline.</p>
<p>But Mike Berk was at the Tell All to discuss his relationship with Ximena, even though his old posts are arguably&nbsp;<em>worse </em>in several ways.</p>
<p>Why the double standard? That&#8217;s what Alina is asking.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Alina Kasha, whose real name is Alina Kozhevnikova, apologized after her scandal came to light.</p>
<p>(She initially denied that the posts were hers, but did <em>ultimately </em>issue an apology)</p>
<p>Now, she is wondering why Mike has not done the same &#8230; and why he&#8217;s not getting even close to as much backlash as she did.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Last week, just days before Part 1 of the Tell All aired, Alina released a YouTube video titled &quot;It&#8217;s Always Bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t feel fairness,&quot; she noted, &quot;I can&rsquo;t keep silent so I felt like I need to address it.&quot;</p>
<p>Alina emphasized that she did not intend to &ldquo;bash anyone&rdquo; and that she does not have &ldquo;any personal issues&quot; with Mike.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Alina acknowledged her own scandal, which came to light in January, much earlier in Season 5.</p>
<p>In posts dating back to around 2015, she had used, to put it bluntly, variations of the N-word, a racial slur that dehumanizes Black people.</p>
<p>Though she is Russian and English is a second language to her, her grasp of English and her having spent time in America made it difficult to understand how she could think that the slur was acceptable.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>After the outcry over her genuinely upsetting posts, Alina was fired, disinvited from the Tell All, and she and Caleb Greenwood were edited out of the rest of the season.</p>
<p>But last month, Mike&#8217;s old posts were discovered featuring the same abhorrent racial slur.</p>
<p>Mike, an American for whom English is his native language, has no cultural or linguistic excuses &#8230; and the content of his posts was more malicious.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That right there? That&#8217;s not a &quot;funny&quot; joke, it&#8217;s a classic white supremacist talking point.</p>
<p>(Just for the record &#8212; because using SNAP or other assistance to eat and survive should not be stigmatized &#8212; more white people are on food stamps than any other group)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no punchline to Mike&#8217;s old posts from 2013. Even without the slur, we&#8217;d still be staring bigotry in the face.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time.png" alt="Mike Berk is straight up not having a good time" class="wp-image-359596" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/mike-berk-is-straight-up-not-having-a-good-time-960x540.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing was addressed when this same thing happened to my castmate,&rdquo; Alina observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do anything, nor the network,&quot; she noted &#8212; no public apology, no firing, no disinvitation from the Tell All.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are all against racism,&quot; Alina suggested, &quot;let&rsquo;s hold everybody to the same standards.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;To conclude, I feel like if someone is getting fired and another person does the same thing, they have to bear the same consequences,&quot; Alina stated.</p>
<p>She explained: &quot;It has to be addressed too if it was addressed before, and I think they should also apologize.&quot;</p>
<p>Alina affirmed: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s unacceptable to one has to be unacceptable to another.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A lot of fans of the show have been discussing this same thing.</p>
<p>(And some on social media have only just now learned of Mike&#8217;s scandal, while being very aware of Alina&#8217;s)</p>
<p>So why is there a double standard? Do TLC and Sharp only care about racism sometimes?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Some have suggested that TLC and Sharp Entertainment don&#8217;t necessarily care about racism at all &#8212; not when it comes to firing people, anyway.</p>
<p>These are businesses, who fire people because they might cut into the show&#8217;s bottom line, not because of the moral weight of their scandal.</p>
<p>In short, Alina wasn&#8217;t fired for racism, she was fired for receiving intense backlash with few if any people defending her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, Mike has not been fired, edited out, disinvited, or even issued a public apology.</p>
<p>(By the way, he also used transphobic slurs in these old posts, mocked the murder of Trayvon Martin, and made jokes about the AAPI community)</p>
<p>Yes, his scandal came to light later in the season &#8230; but he also hasn&#8217;t received backlash like Alina has.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>To put it bluntly, sometimes very real scandals are weaponized by people who are acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>Many people were shocked and hurt at Alina&#8217;s scandal, because they had liked her on screen and were baffled by her social media history.</p>
<p>Some people did <em>not </em>like Alina from the show &#8212; because she&#8217;s a woman, because she has a sex life, even because she is disabled.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To the people who already disliked Alina, her scandal wasn&#8217;t upsetting &#8212; it was exactly what they wanted to use to lash out at her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mike &#8212; thanks to a combination of editing, the audience&#8217;s tendency to like men more, and some sympathetic moments &#8212; is less hated.</p>
<p>Only in his final episodes on screen did Mike begin to show an ugly side of himself to the cameras, but that&#8217;s kind of too late to rile up most viewers.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This is not the first time that TLC has shown a clear double standard based, not upon actions, but upon popularity.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn&#8217;t <em>90 Day Fiance</em>&#8216;s fault &#8212; maybe it&#8217;s the fault of lawmakers for not regulating the reality TV industry in a way that protects stars and producers and mandates transparency.</p>
<p>Remember, this is the show that quietly disinvited <a href="/videos/geoffrey-paschel-sentenced-to-18-years-in-prison-for-kidnapping/">now-incarcerated domestic abuser Geoffrey Paschel</a> from the Tell All without warning viewers of who he really is.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Some fans had to learn months or years later, on social media, about Geoffrey&#8217;s harrowing personal and criminal history.</p>
<p>Imagine if Geoffrey weren&#8217;t in prison where he belongs, and fans met up with him and were endangered because they saw him on TV and thought that he was &quot;safe.&quot;</p>
<p><em>90 Day Fiance</em> is an enormously successful franchise, but the responsible choice would be to employ more fairness and a little transparency when it comes to these choices.</p>

<p>Of all of the couples this season, only one could be together on the Tell All stage.</p>
<p>Some of them are playing details of their lives close to the vest &#8212; especially those who will be on future seasons.</p>
<p>But how many of them are really still together?</p>

</p>
<p>First up, let&#8217;s start with the easiest couple to address.</p>
<p>Memphis and Hamza stumbled a little early on in their relationship, as both needed to be more honest with the other.</p>
<p>They also have one of the biggest language gaps ever featured in this franchise, leading Memphis to use simplified language &#8230; and earning a &quot;Cookie Monster&quot; nickname.</p>

<p>Memphis and Hamza made it clear that there was more than &quot;sexy time&quot; between them, however.</p>
<p>After a lot of ups and downs and communication struggles, the two married in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Memphis arrived as Hamza&#8217;s girlfriend. She flew back to Michigan a married, pregnant woman.</p>

<p>Memphis showed up at the Tell All witha&nbsp; total glow-up, knockout look &#8230; and still together with Hamza.</p>
<p>She stood out among the other couples, as she and Hamza were the only ones who could physically sit together.</p>
<p>Everyone else, whether still &quot;together&quot; or apart, had one partner on the stage, one partner communicating through a screen.</p>

<p>Up next are Kimberly and Usman.</p>
<p>Usman has appeared on the show before, and he&#8217;s back again with yet another older American woman.</p>
<p>Kimberly did not want to be seen as a &quot;superfan.&quot; What she did want was yammy-yammy from Usman.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Despite initially treating her like a groupee &#8212; and not the kind that you sleep with &#8212; Kimberly got what she wanted.</p>
<p>He spent the night, they boned, and though Usman wouldn&#8217;t say &quot;I love you&quot; or kiss her in public, Kimberly was mostly happy.</p>
<p>But the season ended with her looking at a future of seeing him a few times a year, at most.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>At the Tell All, Kimberly came prepared to defend her romance with Usman.</p>
<p>However, she was crushed when she &#8212; and her castmates &#8212; saw a clip of Usman calling and flirting with Zara.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the Tell All ended with Kimberly in tears &#8230; but no confirmation of a breakup has surfaced.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Caleb and Alina were a complicated couple, and not just because of their story.</p>
<p>The two met up in Turkey, as their friends-to-lovers story led to them meeting in person for the first time.</p>
<p>Though Alina&#8217;s disability gave Caleb pause at first, the two spent plenty of time in bed together.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Then, of course, Alina was fired, with the couple edited out of the rest of the season and disinvited from the Tell All.</p>
<p>Alina issued a public apology following her racism scandal.</p>
<p>Though many viewers noted that some of her critics were using a real wrongdoing in bad faith because they simply disliked her, it didn&#8217;t change her past misdeeds.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Though Alina and Caleb appear to have parted on good terms, it does not look like they are still together.</p>
<p>On what we saw, it looked like Caleb wasn&#8217;t prepared for a long-term romance with Alina in light of her disability.</p>
<p>Perhaps the ending that we saw months ago was misleading, but they are not at the Tell All to correct us.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Mike and Ximena started off as a very sweet couple.</p>
<p>Mike hasn&#8217;t been in a &quot;real&quot; realtionship since he was 14, while Ximena is a young mother of two.</p>
<p>The two met through Ximena&#8217;s cam work, where Mike offered to financially support her so that she could quit that job.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Despite some initial tender moments, the two turned out to be a toxic nightmare.</p>
<p>Ximena seemed to grow bored of Mike, picking both fair and unfair flaws &#8230; yet not quite going so far as to break up with him.</p>
<p>When Mike felt brokenhearted, he showed his ugly side, insulting Ximena and her family, and at one point refusing to leave her home.</p>

<p>Mike began to give the impression that he felt that supporting Ximena as a girlfriend meant that he owned her.</p>
<p>Hurt people say hurtful things, but that is not a side of Mike that many viewers will soon forget.</p>
<p>Add that to <a href="/2022/03/mike-berk-under-fire-for-racist-bigoted-social-media-posts/">Mike&#8217;s racism scandal</a> &#8212; in many ways worse than Alina&#8217;s, despite less backlash &#8212; and it was hard to feel sorry for him.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This toxic couple ended their engagement before the season ended, but a cliffhanger on the finale showed them threatening to reconcile.</p>
<p>On the Tell All Part 1, they confirmed that they&#8217;re back together, and there have been reports for months that Mike and Ximena filmed another season.</p>
<p>However, the two strongly hinted at another ugly breakup in February, and Ximena seems to already be with a new man.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speaking of creepy men, up next, we have Ben and Mahogany.</p>
<p>Ben is in his fifties and believed that he was speaking to a 24-year-old, not to a 22-year-old.</p>
<p>Mahogany had tried to discourage Ben from coming, but he ignored her wishes and flew down anyway. This was the beginning of a pattern for him.</p>

<p>At first, Mahogany seemed like a total catfish, and viewers still aren&#8217;t sure what her whole deal is.</p>
<p>Ben dialed up his creepiness factor to new heights, repeatedly crossing her boundaries and using textbook manipulative tactics.</p>
<p>As the season ended, they were very much over, though at the Tell All, Ben confirmed that they had spoken the night before.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Ben and Mahogany were spotted in a mall in Lima, Peru several weeks ago, even photographed by a fan of the show.</p>
<p>Whether or not they were filming again, they were unwisely spending time in each other&#8217;s company months and months after Season 5 filming had wrapped.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t explain his judgment or hers. Some people cannot stop making the same mistake.</p>

<p>Ella and Johnny were perhaps this season&#8217;s least eventful couple, as they did not get a chance to meet.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s a real shame, and personally I hope that they can return for another season and meet up &#8212; they both deserve happiness)</p>
<p>Between the COVID-19 pandemic itself and the protections put into place, Johnny kept delaying meeting Ella, and each delay hurt more than the last.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sometimes, even the most valid excuses in the world stop being enough after they&#8217;re used too many times.</p>
<p>Ella ended up sleeping with a friend, which she confessed to Johnny (for some reason, Kimberly was particularly furious with her over this).</p>
<p>It appears that they are still together (unless they say otherwise during Part 2), but have yet to actually meet.</p>

<p>Gino and Jasmine were one of the most bizarre and at times horrifying couples this season.</p>
<p>There is simply no excuse for how much screaming and betrayal viewers were forced to endure.</p>
<p>They both owe each other so much more than what they offered.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-1024x576.png" alt="Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda hug, are engaged" class="wp-image-359748" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/gino-palazzolo-and-jasmine-pineda-hug-are-engaged.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>Gino leaked Jasmine&#8217;s nudes to his ex, simultaneously breaking Jasmine&#8217;s trust while proving that he&#8217;s hung up on his ex.</p>
<p>Jasmine would cry and scream and yell with little or no provocation &#8212; having meltdowns over the color of the walls of Gino&#8217;s house, which she has never visited.</p>
<p>The two ended up getting engaged despite a bajillion fights and other red flags, though Gino &quot;forgot&quot; to bring up a prenup.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>At the Tell All, Gino declared that he had &quot;decided&quot; that he did not need a prenup.</p>
<p>Though Jasmine complained about him choosing to masturbate instead of give her his &quot;meat,&quot; which she craved, they are clearly still together.</p>
<p>Gino confirmed that they are in the K-1 visa process and that he hopes to bring her home to MIchigan soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>For the final episodes of Season 5 and for <a href="/slideshows/usman-umar-breaks-kimberly-menzies-heart-on-the-90-day-fiance-be/">the <em>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</em> Tell All</a> special, one couple was conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>Caleb Greenwood and Alina Kasha received a limited run this season before being edited out following Alina&#8217;s scandal.</p>
<p>Some viewers didn&#8217;t quite get the memo, and had expected to see them appear on the Tell All.</p>
<p>On Instagram, Caleb is addressing their conspicuous absence.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;As everyone has noticed and was announced on the episode, I&rsquo;m not at the Tell All,&quot; Caleb wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish my fellow 90 Day cast mates the best,&quot; he expressed.</p>
<p>Caleb then encouraged his followers: &quot;Stay tuned next week for part 2 as all the couple&rsquo;s relationship statuses unfold.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In a previous Instagram post, Caleb also touched upon the subject of his and Alina&#8217;s removal from the show.</p>
<p>&quot;We only took a few photos in Turkey as a group and this is one of my favorites,&quot; he wrote beside a photo of the couple with Alina&#8217;s friend, Elijah.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people send me messages,&quot; Caleb acknowledged, &quot;that they are surprised that our story wrapped the way it did and wasn&rsquo;t longer.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Caleb acknowledged: &quot;But some things are beyond my control.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the ups and downs,&quot; he reflected, &quot;the trip really was a good experience that carries fond memories.&quot;</p>
<p>Caleb concluded: &quot;And yes, some of them even include Fabulous Elija despite all his dramatic antics.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Caleb&#8217;s bromance with Elijah was really interesting &#8212; they are two men who really care about Alina but have very little else in common.</p>
<p>Elijah was something of a fan favorite despite his limited run on the show.</p>
<p>It might have been interesting to see more of how Caleb and Alina got along after Elijah went home, but we didn&#8217;t see much.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Caleb and Alina had a lot of interesting potential of their own.</p>
<p>Alina is a ltitle person, navigating life with a very visible physical disability.</p>
<p>Even if Caleb weren&#8217;t a very active and fit guy, that could pose unique relationship challenges.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, we did not get to see their full story play out.</p>
<p>While Alina and Caleb&#8217;s on-screen story was interesting and engaging and even relatable, her social media history caught up to her.</p>
<p>Multiple posts, made across different years, using the N-word, were impossible to ignore or excuse.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Alina did post an apology, but her initial denials and excuses did not work in her favor.</p>
<p>Fans struggled to understand how someone who had studied in the United States, even for a matter of months, could be confused about such a slur.</p>
<p>(Some adult Americans also claim &quot;confusion&quot; over the world&#8217;s worst slur, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there)</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>So no, Alina and Caleb were not on the Tell All.</p>
<p>Other stars have been disinvited in the past, following scandals, arrests, and worse.</p>
<p>With Alina and Caleb, the show took the unprecedented step of editing out their story from the rest of the season.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Alina is remorseful and in many ways a good person, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that an apology is enough following racist slurs.</p>
<p>(And frankly, as a white person, it wouldn&#8217;t be <em>my </em>place to say if it were)</p>
<p>But one thing isn&#8217;t adding up &#8230; because look who did make it to the Tell All.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Mike Berk and Ximena Cuellar were on the Tell All, even after Mike &#8212; an American with no &quot;I&#8217;m Russian&quot; excuse &#8212; had his own scandal.</p>
<p>We know that a lot of older social media comes from a time when &quot;shock&quot; humor was popular, but it&#8217;s hard to see that applying here.</p>
<p>If <a href="/2022/03/mike-berk-under-fire-for-racist-bigoted-social-media-posts/">Mike&#8217;s history of racist and bigoted posts</a> were supposed to be jokes &#8230; what exactly is the punchline?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That&#8217;s not a joke, that&#8217;s just repeating white supremacist talking points and using a racial slur in the process.</p>
<p>So why is Mike still on the show &#8212; and likely returning for another season &#8212; while Alina (and by extension, Caleb and Elijah) is just a memory?</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s because Alina wasn&#8217;t actually fired for racism.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Alina was fired because of massive backlash from fans that (understandably) was not countered by any defenders.</p>
<p>Calls to fire verbal abusers like Angela Deem or accused predators like Big Ed are often countered by fans &#8212; we can&#8217;t explain it, but some people actually <em>like</em> them.</p>
<p>The calls to fire Alina were vocal, aggressive, and she lacked the polarizing factor of having outspoken fans speak up for her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;re not saying that Alina should still be on the show or that people should have spoken up to defend her, but &#8230; what is Mike still doing there?</p>
<p>The truth is that, though his scandal is almost certainly worse in terms of what he did, the outcry has been far less.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s later in the season. Or maybe some of the (otherwise justified) outcry against Alina was rooted in people who just didn&#8217;t like her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Russian president Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Thousands have already fled the country, fearing for what their lives could become under Russian control.</p><p>Countless more have sought refuge in other nations simply to avoid the conflict, which is so intense that bombs can be heard across the nation.</p><p>There is a real, visceral horror as the world watches, and many fear that no amount of sanctions or &#8220;civilized&#8221; penalties to Russia will stem the slaughter.</p><p>It is not unreasonable that many <em>90 Day Fiance</em> fans have had certain cast members and their families in their thoughts.</p><p>The franchise has seen a large number of cast members from both countries.</p><p>As the people of hundreds of nations watch this brutal conquest take place, these past and present cast members are speaking out.</p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Yara Zaya is from Ukraine</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">1</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Viewers watched and grew to love her. She often referred to how much she loves her home, misses her family, and frankly, isn&#8217;t a New Orleans gal at heart. As the invasion of Ukraine commenced, Yara expressed her horror on social media.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>She never thought that this would happen</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">2</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Yes, Putin&#8217;s mad ambitions have put Ukraine in his crosshairs before. But this? Yara has been on calls with multiple friends in Ukraine. Even people in the western regions of the country are being awoken by the sounds of bombs.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>She hasn&#8217;t been home in more than two years</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">3</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Between the pandemic and the realities of paperwork &#8212; there is documentation that you must have if you intend to leave and return without issue, as other 90 Day Fiance stars have made clear &#8212; Yara hasn&#8217;t been back to Ukraine in 2.5 years. She was planning to visit home in March &#8212; which starts next week. Now, she has to be fearing that she may never be able to return to a free and sovereign Ukraine.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>It&#8217;s an appalling thought</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">4</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Yara shared photos and memories of her home as it was before Putin&#8217;s forces began bombing it from land, air, and sea.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Yara isn&#8217;t sticking to Instagram, either</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">5</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Early Friday morning, after admitting that she has not gotten much sleep (understandably), Yara shared that she was en route to do an interview about the invasion of Ukraine. She even coordinated her clothing to match the flag of Ukraine.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Yara is not alone</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">6</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Her husband, Jovi, spoke of how emotional of a time this is for his family. His wife is from Ukraine, his in-laws are in Ukraine. This is a scary time for everyone, but most of all for those with a personal connection to the nation that is under siege by a hostile aggressor.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Miss Gwen also shared her support</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">7</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Gwen has not been to Ukraine. Like countless people, she has opted to share her support rather than try to speak over those who are most personally affected or know best how to help. Gwen is one of the most universally beloved people to appear on the franchise, and with good reason.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Alina is from Russia</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">8</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Alina &#8212; not Alina Kasha, who has been edited out of Before The 90 Days after a racism scandal, but the OTHER Alina who traveled to Turkey to meet a nice-haired American &#8212; is from Russia, and showed her heartbroken support for Ukraine.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>She shared a post from another Russian native</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">9</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Re-posting Varya Malina&#8217;s post in her Stories, Alina shamed the Russian government for this unprovoked and inexcusable invasion of a sovereign neighbor.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>As for Varya&#8217;s post &#8230;</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">10</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>While we do not always agree with Varya&#8217;s assessment of the character of evil men (Geoffrey, we&#8217;re talking about Geoffrey), her description of Vladimir Putin as a &#8220;bloodthirsty old coocoo man&#8221; is right on the nose. Like the rest of us, she is horrified that this is happening.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Julia Trubkina is also from Russia</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">11</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Julia is living in Virginia and has never been part of the Russian government (in fact, shortly after arriving in the United States, she claimed to not be interested in politics &#8212; possibly just to avoid a conversation with Brandon&#8217;s mother, which is more than understandable). Despite this, some have attacked her simply for being Russian. She did not order the invasion and she opposes it. Many of us in America know what it is like to watch with shame and horror as our country chooses to launch a senseless war based upon lies and propaganda. (On a personal note, I was in Italy when the invasion of Iraq began, and while circumstances were not quite identical, I think that I can guess exactly how Julia is feeling)</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Julia doesn&#8217;t want war</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">12</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>The people of Russia don&#8217;t want war, either. The vicious authoritarian who leads the country initiated this conflict.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Julia even spoke about it elsewhere</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">13</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>While Dr. Drew isn&#8217;t really who we would go to if we wished to discuss an invasion (or for anything else, for that matter), Julia spoke to him about it, including the dangerous spread of misinformation that accompanies this conflict.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Alina Kasha shared the anti-war protests</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">14</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>It cannot be emphasized enough that this is a tremendous risk for any protester. More than 1,000 Russian citizens had been arrested or detained by authorities for protesting against the invasion of Ukraine. Protest is not protected by Russian law, and every person doing it risks having their lives upended.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>How can we help?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">15</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Alina, a Russian citizen, has been wondering just like the rest of us how one can help. On a national level, the literal best thing is for borders to open for anyone fleeing Ukraine, waving visas and not requiring passports. Some countries have already done so. On the personal level, individuals can donate to legitimate, reputable organizations (not random Twitter accounts created this week) to get emergency supplies to those fleeing Ukraine. Many of them have had to leave behind a lifetime of belongings and may need help surviving.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>More protesters</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">16</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Alina is not 90 Day Fiance&#8217;s favorite person following her racism scandal. It is still a good thing that she is using her platform to speak on this issue. Doing bad in the past does not mean that one cannot do good in the present.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Alina has a personal connection to Ukraine</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">17</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>She shared a throwback photo of herself as a child visiting her grandmother in Ukraine.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>This was once a regular thing</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">18</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Alina admitted that she didn&#8217;t even realize exactly when she stopped going to Ukraine regularly for these visits. Like so many others, she is unsure of when she or anyone else might be able to return &#8212; and what Ukraine will look like.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Alina&#8217;s friend Elijah spoke up</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">19</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Elijah, who quickly gained a fan favorite status among many viewers as he played third wheel with Alina and Caleb, did not mince words, expressing his shame at living under Russia&#8217;s current (and decades-spanning) political regime. Our hearts go out to him and all who live under Putin&#8217;s grasp &#8212; including a growing number of Ukrainians.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Anfisa Nava?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">20</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Anfisa is from Russia, but does not seem to be saying much on Instagram. Perhaps she is waiting to find the right words.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Natalie Mordovtseva?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">21</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Many 90 Day Fiance fans have thought of Natalie&#8217;s elderly mother during this grim time. We&#8217;re sure that Natalie is, too. Natalie does not seem to be talkative, but she may be more focused upon staying in touch with loved ones who are living in a war zone than she is on making public statements. We wish her mother the very best.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Jesse Meester, for some reason &#8230;</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">22</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s better to share something kind like Gwen did than to write up something of your own about a topic to which you have no connection. This is especially true when what you write is the sort of pointless statement that sounds very smart to dumb people, though that is admittedly Jesse&#8217;s whole brand. Jesse, this is not your moment.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Lana</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">23</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Though Lana&#8217;s Instagram is private, she also expressed her devastation over the invasion, geotagging her location as being in Kyiv, the country&#8217;s besieged capitol.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>On the other side of things &#8230;</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">24</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>While Ukrainian-born and almost all of the Russian cast members were speaking out against the invasion, Sasha Larin took to his Instagram Story to defend the attack, alleging that Russia must have some sort of justification. While many were shocked by his post, very few 90 Day Fiance fans could really say that they were all that surprised that he felt that way. He was widely disliked by viewers.</p></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Sasha did take that down</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">25</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>He replaced his initial bad take with a softer take that was still not a walk back. While thousands of Russians protested in the streets of cities (many of whom have since been tortured by Russian authorities), Sasha simply said that he doesn&#8217;t want war &#8230; but won&#8217;t actually speak against the invasion, because Russia is doing it.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Emily had to chime in</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">26</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Emily Larina knew how this makes her look for being with him. It&#8217;s sad to say, but many 90 Day Fiance fans struggle to respect her purely because she is with Sasha. We are sure that she is in a complicated position.</p></figure></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</em> star <a href="/2022/01/alina-kasha-fired-edited-out-of-remaining-90-day-fiance-before-t/">Alina Kasha was fired</a> following a disturbing racism scandal and hefty backlash.</p>
<p>TLC vowed to edit her story out of the rest of the season, an unprecedented extra step that they have yet to make good upon.</p>
<p>Alina, who initially denied that her racist posts were real, initially apologized &#8230; but sent mixed signals in the worst way.</p>
<p>Now, she has released a lengthy apology. Some worry that she&#8217;s just making more excuses.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In a YouTube video that Alina shared this week, she explained why she hadn&#8217;t come out with this apology weeks ago.</p>
<p>She said that it took her a while to think on what exactly she should say.</p>
<p>At the same time, Alina added that she was &quot;told to keep silent and not say anything.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I never wanted to hurt anyone at all, and I am extremely sorry I did,&quot; Alina expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;I won&rsquo;t ever use any of these derogatory words again,&quot; she vowed.</p>
<p>&quot;I acknowledge my fault and, once again, I am truly, sincerely sorry,&rdquo; Alina emphasized.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Alina also made a promise to work on her ignorance and to educate herself.</p>
<p>But her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op29hNbiAk4">nearly hour-long YouTube video</a> obviously included more than a simple apology.</p>
<p>She also tried to explain &#8230; which, perhaps some people needed, but it was also where others felt that she went astray.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>One of the biggest issues with Alina&#8217;s initial explanation, that as a Russian she had not known how bad the N-word was, was her alternate spelling.</p>
<p>She used the &quot;qq&quot; letters to replace the &quot;gg&quot; in the slur at one point, which seemed like an acknowledgment that she knew to not use it.</p>
<p>Alina explained in the video that she had seen the Q-variant on Facebook and thought that it was a &quot;better way&quot; to say the word.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Alina elaborated, explaining that she knew that the word was bad, but did not understand the history behind it.</p>
<p>To her, writing the word with the letter Q and ending it with the -A suffix was like &quot;dang or darn instead of s&#8211;t and shoot.&quot;</p>
<p>Alina also clarified that her infamous beardy &quot;thug&quot; makeup was not blackface (true) or intended to be a racist caricature.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Another major sticking point, beyond the initial racism scandal, was that Alina initially claimed to blogger Mommy Says Bad Words that the posts weren&#8217;t hers.</p>
<p>She accused that blogger of having fabricated the posts using photo editing software.</p>
<p>Alina explained in the video that her initial reaction was that she was &quot;panicked and got scared.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Again, I knew that the n-word wasn&rsquo;t a good word,&quot; Alina cknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;But at the time I didn&rsquo;t fully know America&rsquo;s history with racism and how bad that word is,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Alina added, &quot;how it&rsquo;s used to discriminate and demean people.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Alina claimed that she thought of the slur as &ldquo;more as a cuss word and like an exclamation&rdquo; and &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t know it was used to attack people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added that she only spent about a year studying abroad in the United States, and though it helped her English, she did not come away with an American&#8217;s understanding of cultural history or slurs.</p>
<p>(To be fair, there are Americans who express &quot;confusion&quot; over slurs, and why the marginalized people at whom they are aimed can use them if they choose)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Of course, Alina&#8217;s racism was aimed at more than just the Black community.</p>
<p>She wore a sari while mocking the Muslim community with a quip about being someone&#8217;s &quot;134th wife.&quot;</p>
<p>She also mocked Hugh Grant&#8217;s children, who are mixed race.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Alina apologized for both of those, indicating that she did not intend any bigotry towards Asians or Muslims.</p>
<p>She correctly reminded viewers that not everyone is familiar with American culture or the nuances of how slurs are different from simple obscenities.</p>
<p>However, we have to note that the N-word is not exclusive to America or even to English-speakers, and existed in multiple variants among European colonial powers for centuries.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There was a time when some of Alina&#8217;s offensive posts might have been considered mainstream &quot;edgy&quot; humor.</p>
<p>We can also acknowledge that she likely did not intend malice.</p>
<p>At the same time, not all racism is intentional (dare we say that most is unintentional), and Alina can continue to learn and grow without enjoying reality stardom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>If you watched <a href="/slideshows/jasmine-pineda-furiously-swipes-gino-palazzolos-hat-on-90-day-fi/">the latest episode of <em>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days</em></a> on Discovery Plus, you saw something odd.</p>
<p>Alina Kasha and Caleb Greenwood&#8217;s footage simply repeated from the week before, while everyone else had new material.</p>
<p>TLC viewers, on the other hand, saw the originally planned episode &#8212; including Caleb and Alina&#8217;s ongoing story.</p>
<p>That story took a dark turn as Caleb confessed that he&#8217;s simply not up for spending the rest of his life with a little person.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="/2022/01/alina-kasha-fired-edited-out-of-remaining-90-day-fiance-before-t/">Alina Kasha was fired by TLC</a> for a series of appalling racist posts, including the rampant use of the N-word.</p>
<p>While none of that twisted side of her made it onto screen, TLC vowed to purge Alina&#8217;s storyline from the show &#8212; an unprecedented extra step.</p>
<p>It now appears that they only did this on Discovery Plus, airing at least some new footage on TLC &#8212; and yes, we have a clip.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/caleb-greenwood-tells-alina-kasha-that-he-cant-be-with-a-little"></a></figure></div>
<p>Again and again, Caleb has put off giving Alina a firm commitment on their future as a couple.</p>
<p>Thirteen years of (admittedly, on-again, off-again) friendship followed by an intense online romance is a lot, but is it enough?</p>
<p>On <em>some </em>versions of Season 5, Episode 9, Alina told Caleb that it was time to give her a straight answer about their future.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I feel like I&#8217;ve been very patient with Caleb so far,&quot; Alina expressed to the cameras.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve always heard this, &#8216;I need more time, not too soon,&#8217; and I respected it,&quot; she noted.</p>
<p>&quot;But now, it&#8217;s not gonna work &#8212; this excuse &#8212; anymore,&quot; Alina affirmed just two days before time to leave Turkey.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m against,&quot; Caleb said about committing to being exclusive.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish this wasn&#8217;t being put to the question right now, because I feel like this is being forced on me,&quot; he admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Caleb said, &quot;if it&#8217;s a on-the-spot answer, then&#8230; It&#8217;s not that simple, Alina.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;If we could make this trip another week or two, I might be able to say yes,&quot; Caleb suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;If you were in America with me, I could maybe say yes,&quot; he added. &quot;It&#8217;s out of respect for you that I&#8217;m taking my time.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, Caleb noted: &quot;You have needs that need to be met.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;You need someone who can pay you attention and help you in those ways,&quot; Caleb said of her disability.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t want to take that lightly,&quot; he stressed. &quot;So one big reason I&#8217;m taking time is to make sure I can be the person who can do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Caleb stated: &quot;I think you deserve someone who can do everything you need in terms of being your aide.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I am trying to get what I want, which is you, in the proper way,&quot; Caleb said. &quot;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying give me more time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, that isn&#8217;t apparently what can happen here, because you need to leave with an answer,&quot; he acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;And if that&#8217;s what you need, I respect that, but this is what I need. I need more time,&quot; Caleb stressed. &quot;And it hurts me. I feel like we have so much here that I wish you could wait.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I think when a guy&#8217;s in love, he just goes and gets what he wants,&quot; Alina countered.</p>
<p>&quot;I just can&#8217;t go back and everything is back to normal, how it was before. I can&#8217;t handle this,&quot; she expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I stated it clearly &#8212; yes or no. &#8230; I don&#8217;t think you love me. You don&#8217;t love me. You&#8217;re not even in love with me,&quot; Alina lamented.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not asking Caleb to marry me, or to move to Russia immediately,&quot; Alina reasoned to the cameras.</p>
<p>&quot;But, it kind of hurts that he doesn&#8217;t know by now. Does he want to be with me or not?&quot; she expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;I know I want be with him,&quot; Alina affirmed. &quot;And I just really feel played.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The next day, Caleb confessed: &quot;I really like you, but I&#8217;m not used to dating little people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told everyone it&#8217;d be no big deal that we were different, but the reality is there were challenges there for me,&quot; he admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m a bachelor, I&#8217;m very independent. I&#8217;m used to doing me,&quot; Caleb explained. &quot;So it scares me a little bit to imagine being with you long-term.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Alina was hurt. &quot;I don&#8217;t understand. When you love someone, it shouldn&#8217;t be so hard to help or whatever. It just becomes a part of your daily life, no?&quot;</p>
<p>Caleb tried to explain:&nbsp; &quot;I just don&#8217;t know if the life I want for myself is one of helping someone so much.&quot;</p>
<p>Putting the brutal in brutally honest, he added: &quot;Because my life has been so different than that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This was confirmation of Alina&#8217;s worst fears.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand it might be scary, but I&#8217;m kind of tired of that, of people being scared to be with me because I require, like, help or whatever,&quot; she expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;But this is the first reason, always,&quot; Alina lamented. &quot;And I thought you were different.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Caleb admitted: &quot;I thought I was, I didn&#8217;t think this would be a problem.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued: &quot;But the reality is this is a struggle I&#8217;m facing. But I don&#8217;t know what to say beyond that.&quot;</p>
<p>The two shared a hug and prepared to say their goodbyes as they both leave Turkey. Wow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two things that the disabled community fears most while dating.</p>
<p>The first is chasers: people who fetishize their disability.</p>
<p>The second is people who consider their disability and the accommodations that they need to be a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>Caleb Greenwood is not a chaser &#8212; before Alina Kasha, he had never before dated a little person.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a painful moment (that aired only on TLC and not on Discovery Plus), he confessed to her that it was too much.</p>
<p>Citing his lifestyle and sense of independence, he admitted that he couldn&#8217;t see himself with Alina, or any little person, in a long-term relationship.</p>
<p>That was agonizing for Alina.</p>
<p>She had thought, and hoped, that Caleb would be different.</p>

Ximena&#8217;s mom even opens up about how there were things that she didn&#8217;t know &#8212; like cooking &#8212; when she married Jamir, but how sometimes marriage is about learning and growing together. Ximena is still a little unsure. Her mom ALSO mentions that breaking up with Mike could mean having to work again as a single mom, which is not easy. So there are matters of the heart and pragmatic concerns in this, as with most relationships.</p></figure></figure>
