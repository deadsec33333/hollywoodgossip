<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-kevin-costner-and-demi-moore-going-to-date">Are Kevin Costner and Demi Moore going to date?</h2>



<p>According to a report by <em><a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/celebrity/news/kevin-costner-demi-moore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closer</a></em>, Kevin Costner and Demi Moore have been exploring evolving their friendship into something more romantic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kevin has had a crush on Demi since they first met in the 1980s,&#8221; the inside source reported.</p>



<p>The insider explained that &#8220;there&nbsp;just wasn&#8217;t ever the opportunity to pursue her.&#8221; Not until <em>recently</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-1024x669.jpg" alt="Demi Moore on March 2, 2025." class="wp-image-522277" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-2048x1337.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-960x627.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-1080x705.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_01-1200x784.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Demi Moore attends the 97th Annual Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California on March 2, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But now, they’re both single,&#8221; the source pointed out.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the insider alleged, &#8220;he’s seeing this as a long-awaited chance to date his dream woman.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source emphasized: </p>



<p>&#8220;Kevin is being careful not to push too hard &#8211; he’s smart enough to know that would be a turn-off to Demi.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-ve-known-each-other-for-decades">They&#8217;ve known each other for decades</h2>



<p>&#8220;Kevin and Demi have been flirting for a while,&#8221; the insider claimed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; the source continued, &#8220;he’s looking to strike in the most gentlemanly way.&#8221; Oh? And how is that?</p>



<p>&#8220;By cheering her on,&#8221; the insider detailed, &#8220;and encouraging her not to give up after she lost the Best Actress Oscar to Mikey Madison.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-1024x669.jpg" alt="Demi Moore on February 25, 2025." class="wp-image-522279" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-2048x1339.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-960x628.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_demimoore_02-1200x785.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Demi Moore arrives for the 97th Annual Academy Awards Nominees Dinner at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, February 25, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But it’s up to Demi if she wants to take the flirtation further,&#8221; the source then emphasized.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the insider added, &#8220;friends think she definitely should.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source then teased: </p>



<p>&#8220;Don’t be surprised if they’re seen spending more time together in public very soon.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kevin Costner on February 8, 2025." class="wp-image-522280" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_kevincostner_03-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kevin Costner attends the 2025 Fanatics Super Bowl Party at The Sugar Mill on February 08, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Fanatics)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-they-actually-end-up-dating">Will they actually end up dating?</h2>



<p>Considering their shared status as veteran actors and how long they&#8217;ve known each other, it&#8217;s tempting that the two could make a relationship work. Or at least try to.</p>



<p>But we have to emphasize that reports have linked Costner to everyone from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kevin-costner-jennifer-lopez-talking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez</a> to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/hoda-kotb-and-kevin-costner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoda Kotb</a>. He himself spoke out to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/kevin-costner-jewel-relationship-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quash Jewel dating rumors</a>.</p>



<p>If you feel invested in Costner and Moore&#8217;s romantic futures, it&#8217;s smart to keep an eye on these two. But for now, we&#8217;ll believe a relationship when we see it. </p>



<p>The &#8220;talking&#8221; stage just isn&#8217;t going to cut it.</p>

<p>Bruce and Demi were married from 1987 to 2000, and while their divorce was not an entirely civil one, they developed a stable friendship and co-parenting relationship in the years that followed.</p>

<p>“There is great loss, but there is also great beauty and gifts that can come from it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bruce-s-battle">Bruce&#8217;s Battle</h2>

<p>The illness has forced him to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/bruce-willis-retires-from-acting-due-to-serious-health-condition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">step away from public life</a>, but his loved ones continue to offer updates on his condition.</p>



<p>“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” Bruce and his family wrote on Instagram at the time of his diagnosis.</p>

<p>“As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbu-CyELWio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They continued</a>: “This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.”</p>

<p>Bruce and Demi share three daughters together: Rumer, 36, Scout, 33, and Tallulah, 30.</p>



<p>And while it&#8217;s been nearly a quarter century since the A-list stars went their separate ways, it&#8217;s clear that the father of her children still holds a place in Demi&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>We wish Bruce and his family all the best as they fight this battle together.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Demi Moore losing the Oscar <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Mikey Madison</a>, an actress in her 20s, felt a <em>little </em>on the nose.</p>



<p>But that is what happened. The Best Actress award at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2025 Academy Awards</a> went to the lead from <em>Anora</em>, not the lead to <em>The Substance</em>.</p>



<p>Frankly, it just felt like a continuation of <em>The Substance</em>. Thematically, anyway.</p>



<p>At the moment of the announcement, Demi Moore appeared to say something. What was it?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Demi Moore on March 2, 2025 attending the Academy Awards." class="wp-image-520518" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_01-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-beat-demi-moore-for-the-coveted-best-actress-oscar">Mikey Madison beat Demi Moore for the coveted Best Actress Oscar</h2>



<p>The reactions to Demi Moore losing the Oscar and Mikey Madison winning it have nothing to do with Madison or her acting. She&#8217;s excellent and she deserves her flowers.</p>



<p>Even her big fans are balancing excitement for her with an acknowledgment that Moore has received too little recognition for her phenomenal career.</p>



<p>However, many can only imagine how Moore is feeling. <em>The Substance</em> is, after all, about the intersection of ageism and misogyny in the entertainment industry. Now, she&#8217;s not even winning an Oscar for it.</p>

<p>At the moment of the announcement that Mikey Madison had won the Best Actress Oscar for <em>Anora</em>, Demi Moore appeared to say something. But what?</p>



<p>According to a lip reader for <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14454501/Demi-Moore-shock-snub-Oscars-lip-reader-reveals-reaction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, what the legendary actress said may have been a <em>bit </em>sarcastic.</p>



<p>“Demi says ‘nice,’ but she isn’t smiling when she says it,” claimed Nicola Hickling. “Her body is almost nodding like she had to force herself to say it.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-watching-demi-moore-lose-to-mikey-madison-has-a-lot-of-people-talking">Watching Demi Moore lose to Mikey Madison has a lot of people talking</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/demi-moore-full-frontal-nude-the-substance-cannes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Substance</a></em> is a body horror film that follows Demi Moore&#8217;s character, an aging actress, whose career has dried up. </p>



<p>Out of desperation, she uses a black market drug (the titular substance) to create a younger copy of herself, but the two soon grow to resent each other. The results are catastrophic.</p>



<p>The film&#8217;s commentary on ageism in the entertainment industry is not subtle. At all. Watching her lose the Oscar was hard for many people. But that Demi Moore lost to 25-year-old Mikey Madison felt a little <em>pointed</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-683x1024.jpg" alt="Demi Moore on February 25, 2025 at the Oscars." class="wp-image-520520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the 97th Annual Oscars Nominees Dinner at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on February 25, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Did Demi Moore lose because of ageism? Did she lose because of the pernicious intersection of ageism and misogyny that is only magnified in the entertainment industry?</p>



<p>Not <em>necessarily</em>. But these are factors that we cannot casually disregard.</p>



<p>Remember, even the most unhinged Oscars voters (folks, many of these people are absurd) likely aren&#8217;t going, &#8220;well, I&#8217;m not voting for a woman in her 60s.&#8221; Most bias of this form takes place in the unconscious.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-as-for-the-best-actress-winner">As for the Best Actress winner &#8230;</h2>



<p>Mikey Madison thanked the production company behind <em>Anora </em>and thanked Sean Baker, the director. Then, she delved into an important message related to her Oscar-winning film.</p>



<p>“I just want to recognize and honor the sex&nbsp;worker community,&#8221; she emphasized. (As it happens, the Oscars took place the night before <a href="https://www.nswp.org/event/international-sex-worker-rights-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Sex Worker Rights Day</a>)</p>



<p>“Yes, I will continue to support and&nbsp;be an ally,&#8221; Madison affirmed. &#8220;All of the incredible people,&nbsp;the women that I’ve had the&nbsp;privilege of meeting from that&nbsp;community has been one of the&nbsp;highlights of this incredible&nbsp;experience.”</p>

<p>What is the net worth of Demi Moore?</p>



<p>From her early days starring in <em>St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire</em> to her <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2024/06/the-brat-pack-dissension-in-the-ranks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brat Pack</a> era to her much more recent full-frontal<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/demi-moore-full-frontal-nude-the-substance-cannes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> nude scene in <em>The Substance</em></a>, she is a Hollywood legend.</p>



<p>She has worked for decades, costarred with and even married other A-listers, and entertained generations.</p>



<p>After all of that, we certainly <em>hope </em>that she&#8217;s rolling in dough.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-demi-moore-s-net-worth">What is Demi Moore&#8217;s net worth?</h2>



<p>According to online estimates &#8212; which we would always be wise to view as educated guesses &#8212; Demi Moore&#8217;s net worth is around $200 million in 2024.</p>



<p>That is an impressive fortune, even by A-list actor standards.</p>



<p>Her wealth makes her a standout. But then, so does her career, her beauty, and her acting talent.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Demi Moore in May of 2024." class="wp-image-501649" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the Red Carpet of the closing ceremony at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 25, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Demi Moore was born in 1962 in Roswell. Even the small roles that she enjoyed at the start of her career were in memorable projects, like <em>Blame It on Rio</em> and <em>St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire</em>.</p>



<p>However, she truly rose to household name status in her 1990 breakout role in <em>Ghost</em>. In that film, which changed the way that people view pottery wheels forever, she starred opposite Patrick Swayze as his still-living love.</p>



<p>That netted Demi her first Golden Globe nomination. It also set her down her blazing path of Hollywood fame.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="844" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-1024x844.jpg" alt='Demi Moore on June 7 of 2024 to discuss "Brats."' class="wp-image-501650" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-1024x844.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-300x247.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-768x633.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-2048x1688.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-960x791.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-1080x890.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_03-1200x989.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore speaks onstage the &#8220;BRATS&#8221; premiere during the 2024 Tribeca Festival at BMCC Theater on June 07, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Theo Wargo/Getty Images for Tribeca Festival)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-else-did-demi-moore-gain-her-nine-figure-fortune">How else did Demi Moore gain her nine-figure fortune?</h2>



<p>To be clear, Demi Moore was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood in the 1990s. Her pay for <em>Striptease </em>was $12.5 million &#8212; a value which has doubled by 2024 standards.</p>



<p>She raked in millions for other projects, including $5 million for the legendary <em>Indecent Proposal</em>.</p>



<p>During her busiest acting years, she raked in an estimated $60 million. Decades later, that would be $100 million in value.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="705" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-705x1024.jpg" alt="Demi Moore at the end of May in 2024." class="wp-image-501651" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-705x1024.jpg 705w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-206x300.jpg 206w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-768x1116.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-1409x2048.jpg 1409w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-660x960.jpg 660w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-743x1080.jpg 743w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-826x1200.jpg 826w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-scaled.jpg 1761w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the FYC red carpet event For FX&#8217;s &#8220;FEUD: Capote Vs.

<p>Of course, Demi Moore&#8217;s net worth also stems from less exciting things.</p>



<p>For example, one of her A-lister ex-husbands is Bruce Willis. During their divorce, she received $90 million in both cash and marital property.</p>



<p>And speaking of real estate, she has made numerous investments &#8212; purchasing high end properties and selling them later. This isn&#8217;t just about Hollywood mansions and New York penthouses (though she has owned and sold both), but also properties in the midwest. Way to diversify!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demi-moore-was-part-of-the-brat-pack-and-participated-in-the-brats-documentary">Demi Moore was part of the Brat Pack, and participated in the &#8216;Brats&#8217; documentary</h2>



<p>As we have reported elsewhere, Hulu&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/06/10/brats-documentary-about-1980s-brat-pack-new-on-streaming-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Brats </em>documentary</a> became a viral hit over the summer of 2024.</p>



<p>Demi Moore participated in the documentary and attended the premiere.</p>



<p></p>



<p>This will, first and foremost, be a welcome wave of 1980s nostalgia for people who remember the &#8217;80s with fondness. Even younger people who just find the era fascinating might enjoy it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Demi Moore is an exception when it comes to many actors of that era. Many had careers interrupted &#8212; by scandals, by family, and more. Meanwhile, Demi remains iconic to multiple generations.</p>



<p>And now, she&#8217;s a first-time <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/">Academy Award nominee</a> for her work on <em>The Substance</em>!</p>



<p>Obviously, Demi is a true Hollywood success story. </p>



<p>And she has the net worth to show for it.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Demi Moore won a Golden Globe for her leading role in The Substance.</p>



<p>She was then <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/">nominated for an Oscar</a>.</p>



<p>But while the veteran actress is clearly doing well in her professional life, fans across the globe are buzzing over a certain rumor pertaining to her <em>personal</em> life.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518665" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192043336-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore poses with the Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture  Musical or Comedy award for &#8220;The Substance&#8221; in the press room during the 82nd annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, 2025. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Namely: Is Demi Moore really dating Andrew Garfield?!?</strong></p>



<p>According to onlookers at the Golden Globes, posed for photographers at the ceremony with their arms around each other. At one point, during a break in the broadcast, they were also seen talking in very intimate fashion.</p>



<p>“They definitely seemed cozy,” <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/demi-moore-getting-cozy-with-andrew-garfield-amid-romance-rumors/">a source told In Touch</a> this week, claiming that a &#8220;spark&#8221; between the pair &#8220;started months ago&#8221; and adding:</p>



<p>“Now speculation is rampant that a romance is brewing between Demi and Andrew — and everyone is here for it.” </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-1024x630.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518674" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-1024x630.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-300x185.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-768x472.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-2048x1260.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-960x590.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-1080x664.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2192014780-1200x738.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Andrew Garfield arrives for the 82nd annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For those wondering, Moore is 62 and Garfield is 41.</p>



<p>However, Ashton Kutcher was 25 years old when he began dating Demi Moore in 2003; 15 years her junior.</p>



<p>They got married in 2005 and divorced in 2011, which means this may just be Moore&#8217;s thing, you know? There are worse character traits than being attracted to young and handsome men.</p>



<p><em>Much</em> worse.</p>

<p>“They’re both single. She’s more gorgeous than ever, and he’s not only handsome but super charming,” added the In Touch insider, adding that Andrew seemed smitten (“you could see it on his face”) at the Golden Globes.</p>



<p>Moore also shouldn&#8217;t be concerned that things will end badly between her and Garfield, at least not the way they ended between her and Kutcher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Andrew is different than Ashton,” concludes the tabloid source, citing Kutcher&#8217;s previous infidelity. </p>



<p>“He’s mature, empathetic and in touch with his feelings. He ticks all the boxes, and then some.”</p>

<p>On Sunday night, Demi Moore won her first <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/golden-globes-2025-the-complete-list-of-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globe</a> for her performance in <em>The Substance</em>.</p>



<p>Her humble acceptance speech was one of the highlights of the night, and fans are hoping for a repeat performance at the Oscars.</p>



<p>But Demi&#8217;s big night has been somewhat overshadowed by an unexpected controversy involving Kylie Jenner, of all people.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="801" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2192587422-1024x801.jpg" alt="Demi Moore, winner of the Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy award for âThe Substance,â poses in the press room during the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Award at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-demi-moore-give-kylie-jenner-the-cold-shoulder">Did Demi Moore Give Kylie Jenner the Cold Shoulder?</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-pack-on-pda-at-a-complete-unknown-premiere-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet have been dating</a> for quite some time now. </p>



<p>The A-listers are rather secretive about their relationship, but they were first spotted together back in April of 2023.</p>



<p>So no one was surprised when Kylie was by Timmy&#8217;s side at last night&#8217;s ceremony.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kylie Jenner attends the 2024 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on October 28, 2024 in New York City." class="wp-image-516031" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181618054-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kylie Jenner attends the 2024 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on October 28, 2024 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/kylie-jenner-rocks-24-karat-gold-bikini-this-is-hot-billionaire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie might be a billionaire businesswoman</a> with one of the largest social media followings on the planet, she&#8217;s not an artist.</p>



<p>And award shows are all about artists singing one another&#8217;s praises. </p>



<p>That might be why Demi didn&#8217;t seem terribly interested in conversing with the reality star.</p>



<p>Yes, in a clip that quickly went viral on TikTok, Demi seemed to snub Kylie while stopping by her table to converse with Elle Fanning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@goldenglobes/video/7456670427620904198" data-video-id="7456670427620904198" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@goldenglobes" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@goldenglobes?refer=embed">@goldenglobes</a> <p>Spotted 👀 Demi Moore celebrating her win at the GoldenGlobes!</p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Golden Globes - Golden Globes" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-Golden-Globes-7456670448832219910?refer=embed">♬ original sound &#8211; Golden Globes &#8211; Golden Globes</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
</div></figure>





<p>As you can see, Demi greets other stars at the table, but she seems to pass right over Kylie on her way from Elle to Timothee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-divided-response">A Divided Response</h2>



<p>For obvious reasons, Kylie fans were outraged by the perceived snub.</p>



<p>But outside of that bubble, the reaction to the footage was mostly pro-Demi. Some even went so far as to congratulate more for not kowtowing to Kylie.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why on earth is Demi getting any flak for not acknowledging Kylie (who sat in the audience with a smug non-smiling look on her face for most of the night). Demi doesn&#8217;t have to kiss the K-ring!! it&#8217;s the other way around! News flash, Kylie: you&#8217;re not even an eighth as important as you think you are,&#8221; wrote one <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/01/06/celebrity-news/demi-moore-seemingly-snubs-kylie-jenner-in-awkward-interaction-at-2025-golden-globes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> commenter.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;What was DM supposed to do, bow and kiss KJ&#8217;s ring? Smh,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The only reason Kylie is there is her boyfriend. What talent does she have besides taking her clothes off and showing us her latest plastic surgery? Seems to be all the Kardashian/Jenner clan is capable of. She&#8217;s got no business being there and I wonder if Demi even knew who she was,&#8221; a third harshly chimed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly, it&#8217;s annoying that she (KJ) is even there,&#8221; a fourth observed.</p>



<p>You get the idea. In short, it was a big night for Demi all around.</p>



<p>Not only did she win her very first Golden Globe, it seems she also earned quite a few new fans simply by overlooking Kylie!</p>

<p>For Demi Moore, showing full frontal in a nude scene was quite the experience. Especially when the film aired at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>



<p>Society as a whole is so deeply weird about women, aging, celebrities. That goes triple for aging women who are also celebrities.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jason-momoa-demi-moore-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demi Moore remains widely desired</a> at 61, showing full frontal nudity in a film was a big deal. For her <em>and </em>for the still-quite-sexist, alarmingly prudish entertainment industry.</p>



<p>How did that feel?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Demi Moore at Cannes in May of 2024." class="wp-image-500603" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0523_demimoore_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore laughs during &#8220;The Substance&#8221; press conference ahead of the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 20, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-substance-stars-demi-moore-and-margaret-qualley">&#8216;The Substance&#8217; stars Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley</h2>



<p>Demi Moore stars in <em>The Substance</em>, an indie film that played at the Cannes Film Festival. She opened up about the experience during a press conference on Monday, May 20.</p>



<p>According to <em>Variety</em>, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/festivals/demi-moore-full-frontal-nudity-the-substance-margaret-qualley-1236009594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demi Moore described</a> going nude in a full frontal capacity as a &#8220;vulnerable experience&#8221; for her.</p>



<p>However, it could have been much more challenging. Her co-star helped with that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;I had someone who was a great partner who I felt very safe with,&#8221; Demi Moore praised during the press conference.</p>



<p>&#8220;We obviously were quite close – naked,&#8221; she explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the actress added, &#8220;we also got a lot of levity in those moments at how absurd those certain situations were.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-showing-full-frontal-in-a-nude-scene-required-a-lot-of-mutual-trust">Showing full frontal in a nude scene required a lot of &#8216;mutual trust&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;But ultimately, it’s just about really directing your communication and mutual trust,&#8221; Demi Moore affirmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;… Going into it, it was really spelled out – the level of vulnerability and rawness that was really required to tell the story,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>



<p>Moore continued: &#8220;And it was a very vulnerable experience and just required a lot of sensitivity and a lot of conversation about what we were trying to accomplish.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for <em>The Substance</em> itself, the film takes its name from a fictional &#8220;substance&#8221; in the film. Demi Moore portrays an aging celebrity who has lost relevance, so she uses a black market drug to artificially create a younger version of herself. Qualley plays this younger homunculus.</p>



<p>It does not go well, and leads to Moore&#8217;s character becoming disfigured. By the end, her form is likened to an &#8220;abomination.&#8221; Yes, there are prosthetics.</p>



<p>Moore&#8217;s full frontal nude scene comes when her character examines her body before making the fateful choice of using the titular &#8220;substance.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-is-the-substance-really-about">So what is &#8216;The Substance&#8217; really about?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to say that the film represents cosmetic surgery &#8212; botched cosmetic surgery. And how the beauty industry preys upon women and the fear of aging. But it&#8217;s clearly <em>more </em>than that.</p>



<p>As for the full frontal nude scene, that&#8217;s important. On the surface, it&#8217;s important for the audience to understand that Moore&#8217;s character&#8217;s &#8220;fading actress&#8221; status isn&#8217;t the result of some actual flaw. It&#8217;s a societal issue, and she has internalized it.</p>



<p>Also, it matters in a broader sense. Sex scenes in film are now extremely uncommon (what&#8217;s the statistic, 1-in-50 these days?). We are decades past the days of sensational erotic thrillers succeeding at the box office. While we all look forward to the cultural pendulum swinging away from its current Puritanical nightmare, it&#8217;s good to see reminders of the human body&#8217;s role in storytelling.</p>

<p>Jason Momoa doesn&#8217;t seem like the sort of guy who has to beg for dates very often, but apparently, Demi Moore has proven resistant to Aquaman&#8217;s charms!</p>



<p>Jason split from wife Lisa Bonet in 2020, and he&#8217;s been unattached ever since. The two have yet to finalize their divorce.</p>



<p>And according to a new report from the <em>National Enquirer</em>, the action star has become smitten with Demi in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, those feelings might not be mutual.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jason-momoa-and-demi-moore-a-match-made-in-beverly-hills">Jason Momoa and Demi Moore: A Match Made In Beverly Hills?</h2>



<p><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/jason-momoa-begging-demi-moore-for-a-date-after-finalizing-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason has reportedly been texting Demi</a> ever since he made her acquaintance at a screening of the documentary <em>Common Ground </em>in Beverly Hills on January 18.</p>



<p>&#8220;After they chatted, Jason snagged her number from a mutual friend, and he&#8217;s been laying it on thick, telling her she&#8217;s the most gorgeous woman he&#8217;s ever seen,&#8221; a source told the outlet (via Radar Online). </p>



<p>And Jason took immediate advantage of those digits, texting Demi with pickup lines that would be incredibly lame if they came from anyone other than Jason Momoa.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been texting her, saying he hopes she has a day as beautiful as she is,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super cheesy, but Demi&#8217;s loving it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, Demi is loving it, but apparently, she has not yet taken the bait.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been begging her for a date and even calling pals who know her, asking them to put in a good word for him,&#8221; says the source.</p>



<p>&#8220;The idea of hooking up with Demi is a huge fantasy for Jason. He thinks they would make a great match and says Demi could teach him a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider says that Demi is attracted to Jason, but it seems that she has yet to take him up on his offer of a date.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Demi thinks Jason&#8217;s a hunk,&#8221; the source explains.</p>



<p>&#8220;So far, she&#8217;s playing it very cool, but if he keeps this up it&#8217;s only a matter of time before she&#8217;ll crack!&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demi-s-painful-past">Demi&#8217;s Painful Past</h2>



<p>Given that Demi is thrice divorced, and her last two marriages were to A-list actors, we suppose it&#8217;s not surprising that she&#8217;s a little reluctant to get involved with Jason.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/09/demi-moore-ashton-kutched-forced-me-to-have-threesomes-pushed-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demi&#8217;s split from Ashton Kutcher </a>was a nasty one that reportedly took a major psychological toll on the actress.</p>



<p>Moore&#8217;s second husband, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/bruce-willis-diagnosed-frontotemporal-dementia-family-says-actors-condition-has-rapidly-deteriorated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce Willis, was recently diagnosed with dementia</a>, and loved ones say the disease has robbed the screen legend of his ability to speak.</p>



<p>Bruce and Demi split back in 2000, but he&#8217;s the father of her three daughters, and his illness has reportedly been difficult for the entire family.</p>



<p>So Jason might need to give Demi some space at the moment &#8212; then again, maybe the attention of a much younger A-list star is exactly the distraction she needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Demi Moore has gone public with a truly shocking and harrowing admission.</p>
<p>It has to do with something that happened to the actress as a teenager&#8230; her mother&#8217;s role in this tragedy&#8230; and the affect it continues to have on the star.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to Moore in her just-released memoir, &quot;Inside Out,&quot; her very own mother orchestrated a sexual assault against Moore when the actress was 15 years old.</p>
<p>In this book, Moore claims that her alcoholic mother, Virginia King, began taking her to bars to get noticed by men when Moore was a young teenager.</p>
<p>One night, she came home to find an older man there &#8230; in possession of a key to the apartment.</p>
<p>After this man had raped her, Moore alleges he said her <em>mother</em> had sold her to him.</p>
<p>In the book, she writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rape. And a devastating betrayal, revealed by the man&rsquo;s cruel question: how does it feel to be whored by your mother for $500?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Asked if she believed the man, Moore told Diane Sawyer in an interview&nbsp; this week:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, in my deep heart no. I don&rsquo;t think it was a straightforward transaction. But she still did give him the access, and put me in harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s mother died in 1998.</p>
<p>At the age of 12, Moore writes that her mom tried to commit suicide and she was the one who saved her life.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember using my fingers, the small fingers of a child, to dig the pills my mother had tried to swallow, out of her mouth,&rdquo; Moore writes in the memoir, labeling this a &quot;life-changing moment&quot; for her.</p>

<p>The actress would go on to check into rehab drug and alcohol abuse in the mid 1980s, prior to making it huge in Hollywood with roles in such blockbusters as Ghost, A Few Good Men and Indecent Proposal.</p>
<p>She has made numerous headlines over the past several due to the many revelations in this book, such as:</p>
<p>&#8211; One of the reasons she split from ex-husband Ashton Kutcher is that <a href="/2019/09/demi-moore-ashton-kutched-forced-me-to-have-threesomes-pushed-me/">he talked her into threesomes that she later regretted</a>.</p>
<p>&#8211; She miscarried a baby girl six months into her pregnancy back when she was married to Kutcher.</p>
<p>&#8211; After her divorce from Kutcher, she dropped down to 102 pounds and&nbsp;collapsed at a party and was hospitalised after smoking synthetic cannabis and inhaling nitrous oxide at one point.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I guess the fundamental question that came forward for me was, &#8216;How did I get here?&#8217;&quot; Moore shared with Sawyer, referencing the party collapse and adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, from where I started to what I&#8217;ve experienced, where I&#8217;ve been, how did I get here?&quot;</p>
<p>Continued the actress of this time period:</p>
<p>&quot;I lost me. I think the thing, if I were to look back, I would say, I blinded myself and I lost myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside Out went on sale on Tuesday, September 24.</p>
<p>We wish Demi Moore the best.</p>
