<p>Barack Obama has opened up about his marriage.</p>



<p>For reasons that don&#8217;t exactly seem concrete or proof of much of anything at all, there&#8217;s been chatter of late that the former President of the United States is headed for a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/barack-obama-divorce-chatter-hits-fever-pitch-source-claims/">divorce from wife Michelle Obama</a>.</p>



<p>During a conversation with Hamilton College President Steven Tepper on April 3, the 63-year old didn&#8217;t tackle this speculation head-on.</p>



<p>But he still made headlines due to his candor.</p>

<p>Admitting to having been “in a deep deficit with my wife” after his two terms in the Oval Office ended, Obama explained further:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things.</p>



<p>The spouses got married in 1992 and are parents of two daughters: Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23. They&#8217;ve also been honest over the years about the nature of their relationship.</p>



<p>In December 2022, for example, Michelle said there was a decade during their relationship when “she couldn’t stand” her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;People think I&#8217;m being catty by saying this &#8212; it&#8217;s like, there were 10 years where I couldn&#8217;t stand my husband,&#8221; she said in a conversation with Revolt TV. &#8220;And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.&#8221;</p>



<p>Because one of them was a two-term President, the Obamas lived in the White House from January 2009 to January 2017.</p>



<p>In May 2023, when Obama was asked about his wife&#8217;s previous remarks on CBS Mornings, he responded: </p>



<p>“Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her&#8230;</p>



<p>“Michelle — when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four. </p>



<p>:And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasn&#8217;t normal.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="824" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-1024x824.jpg" alt="Former U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama participate in the unveiling of their official portraits during a ceremony at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, on February 12, 2018 in Washington, DC." class="wp-image-520825" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-1024x824.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-300x241.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-768x618.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-2048x1647.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-960x772.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-1080x869.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-917433514-1200x965.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama participate in the unveiling of their official portraits during a ceremony at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Portrait Gallery, on February 12, 2018 in Washington, DC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, Michelle didn’t accompany her husband Jimmy Carter’s state funeral … or President Donald Trump’s inauguration; events that a former President’s wife is expected to attend.</p>



<p>Observers have been wondering whether we&#8217;re about to witness the first-ever Presidential divorce, with $70 million at stake between the pair if so.</p>



<p>But the Obamas pay this sort of talk no mind.</p>



<p>“Through it all, what kept us sane — and we tried to instill this in our daughters — is, you cannot live through social media,” Michelle told her brother, Craig Robinson, in a talk at SXSW in March. “I don&#8217;t think I have ever once looked at a comment section, period.”</p>

<p>That sounds like sage advice in our opinion.</p>



<p>On Valentine’s Day 2025, meanwhile, both spouses wrote some very nice things online about the other.</p>



<p>“Thirty-two years together and you still take my breath away. Happy Valentine’s Day, @MichelleObama!” wrote the the two-time Commander-in-Chief on February 14.</p>



<p>Added Michelle on that same date:</p>



<p>“If there’s one person I can always count on, it’s you, @BarackObama. You’re my rock. Always have been. Always will be. Happy Valentine’s Day, honey!”</p>



<p>She even included a heat emoji with this very kind message.</p>

<p>Is Hollywood ready for the biggest divorce since Brangelina?</p>



<p>Heck, is America?!?</p>



<p>According to various reports over the last several weeks, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are struggling.</p>



<p>If you believe what Us Weekly even dared to publish this winter, the former President of the United States is &#8220;obsessed&#8221; with actress Jennifer Aniston&#8230; who told Jimmy Kimmel a short time ago that any speculation over her having a relationship with Obama is &#8220;absolutely untrue.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="658" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-1024x658.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519610" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-300x193.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-768x493.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-2048x1316.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-960x617.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-1080x694.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2166938545-1200x771.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Barack Obama and Michelle Obama stand on stage after she introduced him on the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois on August 20, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But does that mean the Obamas&#8217; marriage is safe?</p>



<p>&#8220;The level of rumor and speculation around the Obamas&#8217; marriage has hit a fever pitch,&#8221; a source just <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/obamas-blockbuster-divorce-a-list-friends-pick-sides-pair-split-goes-way-beyond-power-couple/">told Radar Online</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s been made worse by the fact that neither Barack nor Michelle have addressed it.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is debatable, of course. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, both spouses wrote some very nice things on social media about the other.</p>

<p>And yet:</p>



<p>Michelle didn&#8217;t accompany her husband Jimmy Carter&#8217;s state funeral &#8230; or President Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration; events that a former President&#8217;s wife is expected to attend.</p>



<p>History is at stake here, as a President has never split from his spouse.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also a fortune of over $70 million at stake in terms of the couple&#8217;s finances, along with the issue of on whose side certain celebrities will fall if the Obamas really do get divorced.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because they have such deep and long-lasting ties to a whole array of Hollywood figures, people who know them and who are fond of them are bracing for bad news and scenario-planning for what comes next if they really do end their marriage,&#8221; writes Radar.</p>



<p>&#8220;People are going to have to pick sides. Michelle will see to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which people? Well&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ellen DeGeneres has a famously close relationship with Michelle, who was on Ellen&#8217;s now-defunct talk show multiple times, while Barack is well known to have authentic friendships with the likes of Bruce Springsteen and George Clooney,&#8221; this insider continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;The part that gets tricky is if the hypothetical split becomes acrimonious. Nobody wants to get on either of the Obamas&#8217; enemies list – but you can&#8217;t rule out the possibility of that happening. </p>



<p>&#8220;All of their Hollywood pals are very much in wait-and-see mode as the rumors continue to circulate.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that contest might wind up looking like an episode of <em>Euphoria</em> compared to the Battle of the Octogenarians that&#8217;s coming up in &#8217;24!</p>
<p>Yes, when <a href="/2020/11/joe-biden-defeats-donald-trump-voted-46th-president-of-the-unite/">Joe Biden was elected president</a> (and despite what the January 6 gang thinks, he <em>was</em> elected!), many assumed that he would only serve one term because of his advanced age.</p>
<p>Now, however, it looks like the 79-year-old is gearing up to fight for re-election.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-1024x683.jpg" alt="Joe Biden: Running Again?" class="wp-image-416270" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/joe-biden-running-again-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>According to a <a href="https://thehill.com/news/administration/3272281-biden-has-told-obama-hes-running-again/">new report</a> from <em>The Hill</em>, Biden has told his longtime bestie Barack Obama that he <em>is</em> planning to run for a second term in the White House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Biden] wants to run and he&rsquo;s clearly letting everyone know,&rdquo; a source told the outlet this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he thinks he&rsquo;s the only one who can beat Trump. I don&rsquo;t think he thinks there&rsquo;s anyone in the Democratic party who can beat Trump and that&rsquo;s the biggest factor,&rdquo; the insider added.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="798" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-798x1024.jpg" alt="Joe Biden, No Mask" class="wp-image-83076" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-798x1024.jpg 798w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-234x300.jpg 234w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-768x986.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-1196x1536.jpg 1196w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-1595x2048.jpg 1595w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-735x944.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-261x335.jpg 261w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-270x347.jpg 270w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-405x520.jpg 405w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-498x640.jpg 498w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-598x768.jpg 598w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-748x960.jpg 748w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask-841x1080.jpg 841w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/joe-biden-no-mask.jpg 1772w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The news is surprising for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that there&#8217;s an inverse relationship between Biden&#8217;s age and his approval ratings.</p>
<p>According to last week&#8217;s CNBC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of the job that Biden is doing as president, while 53 percent disapprove.</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that the president would be 82 at the start of his second term, and you can see why Amtrak Joe might not be the Dems&#8217; ideal candidate.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="979" height="998" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address.png" alt="Joe Biden Covid Address" class="wp-image-402841" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address.png 979w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-294x300.png 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-768x783.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-735x749.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-329x335.png 329w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-340x347.png 340w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-510x520.png 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-628x640.png 628w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-753x768.png 753w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/joe-biden-covid-address-942x960.png 942w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>However, the party faithful might be feeling that they&#8217;re light on options these days.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; approval ratings are just about as low as Biden&#8217;s, and hopes that a young up-and-comer like Pete Buttigieg will distinguish themself in a meaningful way in time for the &#8217;24 primary season are beginning to wane.</p>
<p>And so, many prominent Democrats are expressing optimism that Biden will find a way to woo leftists who are currently looking at him the way a toddler eyes a plate of Brussels sprouts.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;He can recover,&rdquo; says Democratic strategist Basil Smikle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot will depend on the outcome of the midterms. If Democrats don&rsquo;t fare very well, he&rsquo;ll be going into 2024 from a position of weakness, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking with ABC&#8217;s David Muir in December, Biden was cagey about the prospect of running again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a great respecter of fate,&rdquo; the president said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I&rsquo;m in the health I am in now, if I&rsquo;m in good health, then in fact I would run again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asked how he feels about the possibility of running against Trump a second time, Biden seemed optimistic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to tempt me now,&quot; he joked, adding:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-893x1024.jpg" alt="Joe Biden Sworn In" class="wp-image-401139" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-893x1024.jpg 893w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-262x300.jpg 262w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-768x880.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-1340x1536.jpg 1340w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-735x843.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-292x335.jpg 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-303x347.jpg 303w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-454x520.jpg 454w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-558x640.jpg 558w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-670x768.jpg 670w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-837x960.jpg 837w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in-942x1080.jpg 942w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/01/joe-biden-sworn-in.jpg 1742w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why would I not run against Donald Trump if he were the nominee? That would increase the prospect of running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump is not as popular with Republicans as he was in 2020, but the desire to witness a rematch of the 2020 race might actually give 45 a boost heading into primary season.</p>
<p>According to pollster John Anzalone, such a rematch would likely end in disaster for the GOP.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1018" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-1024x1018.jpg" alt="Joe Biden Fist Pumps" class="wp-image-399992" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-1024x1018.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-300x298.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-768x763.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-1536x1526.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-200x200.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-735x730.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-335x333.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-347x345.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-520x517.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-640x636.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-960x954.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps-1080x1073.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/joe-biden-fist-pumps.jpg 1741w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;You go head-to-head and Joe Biden&rsquo;s always ahead of him. Not by a lot &mdash; 1 or 2 points. People don&rsquo;t want the chaos,&rdquo; Anzalone recently told Politico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even at his lowest approval rating, he still beats Donald Trump.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 75, Trump is younger than Biden, but still not exactly a spring chicken.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Recent events in the American political landscape have raised important questions about what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they signed the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a question that&#8217;s always likely to spark debate, but we think everyone can agree that Thomas Jefferson and company would be surprised to see their powder-wigged peers still running for office 250 years later.</p>

<p>In many ways, the pandemic has highlighted societal inequalities more starkly than any crisis in recent decades.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that the wealthy, famous, and powerful cannot contract the virus.</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama revealed over the weekend that he has tested positive for COVID.</p>

<p>On Sunday, March 13, President Barack Obama shared the news across multiple social media platforms.</p>
<p>&quot;I just tested positive for COVID,&quot; he revealed.</p>
<p>While there are multiple strains of the virus in circulation now, they are all variations of COVID-19.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="871" height="916" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs.png" alt="Barack Obama on CBS" class="wp-image-398973" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs.png 871w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-285x300.png 285w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-768x808.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-735x773.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-319x335.png 319w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-330x347.png 330w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-494x520.png 494w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-609x640.png 609w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/11/barack-obama-on-cbs-730x768.png 730w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(cBS)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days,&quot; President Obama admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; he assured his fans and followers, &quot;am feeling fine otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>He of course touched upon his widely beloved wife&#8217;s health.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted,&quot; President Obama affirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; he revealed, &quot;she has tested negative.&quot;</p>
<p>Using the moment to send a positive message, he wrote: &quot;It&rsquo;s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven&rsquo;t already, even as cases go down.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We do not know when President Obama contracted the virus, but can assume that it was in recent days or weeks.</p>
<p>We also do not know where this took place.</p>
<p>He has recently returned to Washington D.C. following time in Hawaii over the winter. Travel is a common way to catch the virus, but not the only way.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This is not the first time that Obama has used his voice and platform to advocate for vaccinations.</p>
<p>In March of 2021, just one year ago, he took part in a pan-presidential PSA to encourage all Americans to get the jab.</p>
<p>All living presidents, except for disgraced former president Donald Trump, took part in spreading the positive, responsible message.</p>

<p>&quot;This vaccine means hope,&quot; Obama emphasized during the PSA.</p>
<p>He explained: &quot;It will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease.&quot;</p>
<p>He was, of course, right. The risk of infection, of a severe case, of hospitalization, and of death from COVID <em>all </em>go down with vaccination.</p>

<p>Obama is not the first world leader, past or present, to contract the highly contagious airborne virus.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2020, Trump had a severe case of the virus, spending days hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.</p>
<p>While Trump did recover and return to the White House, many on social media remember the incident as a brief moment of levity in a difficult year.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Recently, <a href="/2022/02/queen-elizabeth-ii-tests-positive-for-covid-an-anxious-world-awa/">Queen Elizabeth II tested positive</a> for COVID-19.</p>
<p>While she is the Head of State, not Head of Government, it is not irrelevant to discuss her exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>Between her advanced age and a <a href="/2021/12/queen-elizabeth-ii-dead-conspiracy-theorists-suspect-palace-cove/">conspiracy theory speculating that she passed away late last year</a>, her exposure was of particular concern.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>One of the wonders of the COVID-19 vaccine is that so many of those who experience the virus have mild to moderate cases.</p>
<p>Many people have found that, were it not for the availability of free tests for the virus, they would have assumed that they were suffering a cold or allergies.</p>
<p>However, as with any illness, there will always be <em>some </em>with severe symptoms as long as the virus remains in circulation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last week, Barack Obama turned 60, and he celebrated with a star-studded bash on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard.</p>
<p>You may have heard that there was a good deal of controversy surrounding the soiree, due to an alleged lack of concern for anti-Covid protocols.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, the Obamas significantly scaled back the guest list &#8212; which originally included about 600 attendees &#8212; and announced that the party would now be &#8220;limited to family and close friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>This meant delivering bad news to some A-list celebs who aren&#8217;t used to being uninvited.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Several famous folk have come forward with amusing anecdotes about having their invitations withdrawn, and since it happened to so many movers and shakers, there&#8217;s certainly no shame in it.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a rumor that some big names feel a twinge of embarrassment at having never received an invitation at all.</p>
<p>And the British press is obsessed with the idea that Meghan is one of the people who was shocked to be excluded from the original 600.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="934" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo.jpg" alt="Meghan Markle and Prince Harry: A Photo" class="wp-image-403143" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-300x292.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-768x747.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-735x715.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-335x326.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-347x338.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-520x506.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-a-photo-640x623.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It&#8217;s been almost 18 months since <a href="/2021/07/prince-harry-does-he-resent-meghan-for-forcing-him-to-move-to-am/">Meghan and Prince Harry moved to America</a>, and in that time, they&#8217;ve made friends with some of the nation&#8217;s most influential people.</p>
<p>But as great as it is to hang out with Hollywood&#8217;s best and brightest, few couples anywhere in the world can compare to the Obamas when it comes to clout.</p>
<p>According to insiders, Meghan feels that her attendance at events such as Barack&#8217;s birthday would send a message to the royals that she and Harry have been fully embraced by America&#8217;s VIPs.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So it&#8217;s not surprising that the royalist British tabloids have been delighting in the rumor that Harry and Meghan were snubbed.</p>
<p>Some have even gone so far as to suggest that the Duke and Duchess were not invited because the Obamas were uncomfortable with the way they cut ties with the Queen. </p>
<p>“It arguably will not have gone down particularly well with a couple that have always put ‘family first’ to see Harry and Meghan being so openly critical of their Royal relatives during their Oprah interview in March,” royal commentator Camilla Tominey wrote in The Telegraph.</p>

<p>“When the Obamas returned to the UK in 2016, they made a point of popping into Kensington Palace, where they were introduced to a then three-year-old Prince George, ready for bed in his dressing gown, before sitting down to dinner with William, Kate and Harry,” Tominey continued.</p>
<p>“Last October, the former President made a point of supporting Prince William’s newly launched Earthshot Prize.”</p>
<p>Tominey appears to be making way too much of the fact that the then-president met with the royal family during a visit to the UK.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also not at all surprising that Barack supported a humanitarian project launched by William &#8212; and we&#8217;re sure his endorsement had more to do with the project itself than with the person who started it.</p>
<p>Clearly, the UK tabloid press wants desperately to believe that the Obamas have chosen a side in this conflict, but it seems pretty obvious from their history that the couple prefers not to get involved in this sort of thing.</p>
<p>After all, Barack didn&#8217;t earn the nickname &#8220;No-Drama Obama&#8221; because of his fondness for taking sides in petty beefs.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon, the state of Georgia was called for the Biden, pushing him to a totall of 306 electoral votes&#8230; which is the same number of electoral votes Donald Trump won 2016.</p>
<p>Perhaps you recall Trump using this figure and referring to his as a &quot;landslide&quot; victory.</p>

<p><a href="/2020/11/can-donald-trump-still-win/">Can Donald Trump win</a> the election still?</p>
<p>Absolutely, positively not &#8212; no matter what he and his cult members say on social media.</p>
<p>At this time, Trump has lost 12 of the 13 court cases he&#8217;s filed&#8230; and the single win he garnered in Pennsylvania has no bearing whatsoever on the final tally.</p>
<p>By every official and legal metric, Trump has lost &#8212; and everything he says to the contrary serves no purpose but to undermine voters&#8217; faith in our democracy.</p>

<p>Enter Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In a pair of interviews with CBS &#8212; one that will air on Sunday morning and another that same evening on 60 Minutes &#8212; the former President expressed extreme disappointment in the behavior of the <em>current</em> President.</p>
<p>And in the behavior of those in his party who are either scared of him or who worship at his altar of lies and manipulation.</p>
<p>Or who are simply using Trump and his base to get their own agenda passed.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp; troubled by the fact that Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion,&quot; Obama told Scott Pelley on 60 Miinutes of the voter fraud nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally.</p>
<p>&quot;And that&rsquo;s a dangerous path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obama sat down with Pelley on Wednesday for an interview that will air on 60 Minutes on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 44th President also spoke to Gayle King for an interview that will be shown on CBS Sunday Morning.</p>
<p>&quot;They obviously didn&#8217;t think there was any fraud going on because they didn&#8217;t say anything about it for the first two days,&quot; he told King.</p>
<p>&quot;But there&#8217;s damage to this because what happens is that the peaceful transfer of power, the notion that any of us who attain an elected office, whether it&#8217;s dogcatcher or president, are servants of the people.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a temporary job.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking to King, Obama &#8212; who is on a promotional tour for the first part of his memoir &#8212; said Presidents are &quot;not above the rules.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re not above the law, that&#8217;s the essence of our democracy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a very small margin &#8212; a total of 70,000 votes across three states.</p>
<p>&quot;When Donald Trump won, I stayed up until 2:30 in the morning and I then called Donald Trump to congratulate him,&quot; said Obama, speaking from experience on this exact topic.</p>
<p>&quot;His margin of victory over Hillary Clinton wasn&#8217;t greater than Joe Biden&#8217;s margin over him.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued:</p>
<p>&quot;But if you are listening to some of the talk radio that Trump voters are listening to, if you&#8217;re watching Fox News, if you&#8217;re getting these tweets, those allegations are presented as facts.</p>
<p>&#8216;So you&#8217;ve got millions of people out there who think:</p>
<p>&quot;&#8217;Oh yeah, there must be cheating because the president said so.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>As you can see above, Obama also met with Trump two days after the 2016 election was called.</p>
<p>Trump, conversely, has not even conceded this election to Biden.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unsettling and it&#8217;s troubling to think of how Trump&#8217;s actions will affect his base, but Obama <em>does</em> at least return to one important, overriding fact here:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, look, Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;Kamala Harris will be the next vice president.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not terribly surprising, as Trump&#8217;s personality is perfectly suited to the platform.</p>

<p>If an all-caps &quot;hot take&quot; became sentient and developed a taste for McGriddles and ludicrously oversized suitcoats from the Vincent&nbsp;Adultman collection, it would basically be Donald John Trump.</p>
<p>During his shockingly successful presidential campaign, there was much speculation as to <a href="/2018/11/donald-trump-evokes-game-of-thrones-on-twitter-draws-rebuke-from/">how Trump would use Twitter</a>&nbsp;if he got elected.</p>
<p>It turns out the answer is &#8212; exactly the way he used it before he became president.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="629" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-629x1024.jpg" alt="Donald Trump Takes a Stroll" class="wp-image-309292" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-629x1024.jpg 629w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-184x300.jpg 184w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-768x1250.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-944x1536.jpg 944w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-1258x2048.jpg 1258w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-735x1196.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-206x335.jpg 206w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-213x347.jpg 213w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-320x520.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-393x640.jpg 393w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-472x768.jpg 472w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-590x960.jpg 590w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-664x1080.jpg 664w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/donald-trump-takes-a-stroll-scaled.jpg 1573w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>And why would anyone expect otherwise?</p>
<p>After all, the Donald prides himself on his unwillingness to change, and he&#8217;s repeatedly boasted that no one is &quot;better at Twitter.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it must really chap his ruddy ass to know that former president Barack Obama has a much larger following.</p>
<p>Yes, believe it or not, Obama boasts a following of 100 million to Trump&#8217;s 60 million.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="743" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-1024x743.jpg" alt="The Handshake!" class="wp-image-246776" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-1024x743.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-300x218.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-768x557.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-1536x1114.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-2048x1486.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-735x533.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-335x243.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-347x252.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-520x377.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-640x464.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-960x697.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/the-handshake-1080x784.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Obviously, Obama is a more popular and less controversial figure, but the news is still somewhat surprising, as it feels like you can&#8217;t open any social media platform these days without hearing talk of Trump&#8217;s Twitter account.</p>
<p>The myriad ways in which Trump benefited from lax social media regulations during the 2016&nbsp;election have been well-documented over the years.</p>
<p>But now that he&#8217;s failed to gain any ground on the man who might be his most hated political rival, the president wants the people in charge to <em>do something, dammit!</em></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Enter Twitter CEO and impish elf from a Tolkien novel, Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Dorsey isn&#8217;t nearly as public a figure as Mark Zuckerberg (largely because far fewer people use his platform), so if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with his persona, let&#8217;s just say he&#8217;s every bit the absurdly wealthy eccentric douche as Zuck, but in a very different way.</p>
<p>If Zuckerberg is the STEM geek who hacked into your school&#8217;s computers freshman year, Dorsey is the self-consciously &quot;alt&quot; weirdo who always wears a beanie inside and carries his guitar everywhere.</p>
<p>(We&#8217;ll refer you to the time<a href="/2018/12/azealia-banks-is-using-magic-beard-hair-to-protect-twitters-ceo/"> Dorsey asked Azealia Banks to protect him from ISIS</a> using magic beard hair as an example of this douchiness.)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Anyway, according to <em>The Daily Beast</em> when <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-gets-gentle-reassurance-from-twitter-chief-jack-dorsey-over-follower-count-in-white-house-meeting">Trump met with Dorsey at the White House</a> on Tuesday, the president was <em>not</em> shy about bringing up the issue of his lagging metrics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trump has repeatedly griped to associates about how Obama has had more Twitter followers than he has,&rdquo; two people close to his administration told the outlet, &ldquo;even though &mdash; by Trump&rsquo;s own assessment &mdash; he is so much better at Twitter than Obama is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazingly, multiple outlets have now confirmed that Trump spent much of the afternoon bitching about his comparatively paltry following.</p>

<p><em>The Washington Post</em> is now reporting that Trump spent a &ldquo;significant portion&rdquo; of the meeting accusing Twitter of intentionally stripping him of followers.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this is a common complaint.</p>
<p>For much of the past two years, conservatives have complained of being &quot;shadow banned&quot; by Twitter &#8212; despite a total lack of evidence and repeated denials from Dorsey himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me be clear about one important and foundational fact,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="919" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-919x1024.jpg" alt="Donald Trump at Lectern" class="wp-image-305060" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-919x1024.jpg 919w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-269x300.jpg 269w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-768x855.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-735x819.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-301x335.jpg 301w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-312x347.jpg 312w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-467x520.jpg 467w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-575x640.jpg 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-689x768.jpg 689w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-862x960.jpg 862w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern-970x1080.jpg 970w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/donald-trump-at-lectern.jpg 1370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorsey explained this week that the president&#8217; lost followers were mostly purged &quot;bot&quot; accounts, but obviously he&#8217;s wasting his breath on this matter.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s baffling hatred of his predecessor dates back to the time when he demanded to see <a href="/2011/04/barack-obama-birth-certificate-released-donald-trump-takes-all-t/">Obama&#8217;s birth certificate</a> and nothing is going to cause our large adult president to give this tantrum a rest.</p>
<p>Not even if 40 million Russian bots emerged to finally give him the upper hand in the world&#8217;s pettiest popularity contest.</p>
