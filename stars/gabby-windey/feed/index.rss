<p>It&#8217;s getting ugly between Gabby Windey and Clayton Echard.</p>



<p>Or, perhaps we should say, it&#8217;s getting <em>uglier</em> between Gabby Windey and Clayton Echard.</p>



<p>As you may recall, Echard and Windey met, fell for each other and dated on and after the former&#8217;s season of The Bachelor.  </p>



<p>But then Clayton ultimately dumped her — as well as Rachel Recchia — to pursue a relationship with Susie Evans.</p>

<p>This was years ago.</p>



<p>However, Windey took a shot at Echard&#8217;s online dancing videos several days ago&#8230; and her ex did NOT take kindly to it.</p>



<p>“Gabby, what you’re doing is bullying. There’s no other way around it,” Echard said on April 6, addressing Windey, who previously told Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers that Echard’s dancing posts “will make you run … you’ll wish you didn’t have eyes.”</p>



<p>Added Echard in his response to his former lover:</p>



<p>“You’re attacking me for my physical appearance, you’re attacking me for a passion that I love that’s changed my life. It’s unnecessary and it’s not funny.</p>



<p>“You have such a large platform and you’re setting a really bad example, which is just disheartening. I don’t want people to be scared to try something new because [of] bullying online, like what you’re doing. Do better Gabby.”</p>

<p>Take it away now, Gabby!</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s rich,” the 34-year old said via a TikTok video posted on April 8. “It’s rich coming from a man who exploited my sexual life on TV without me knowing.”</p>



<p><em>Yikes</em>, huh? Things are really getting personal now.</p>



<p>Back on Season 26 of The Bachelor, Echard told viewers that he slept with both Gabby and Rachel, an admission most leads had not made in the past.</p>



<p>“You were intimate with ‘the both of us’ you said on national TV in front of millions without having a conversation with me or any other woman first,” Gabby went on Tuesday. “So, you humiliated us in front of each other and in front of everybody watching the TV show.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="992" height="558" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/echard-evans-abc-rc-220713_1657725266276_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522858" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/echard-evans-abc-rc-220713_1657725266276_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg 992w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/echard-evans-abc-rc-220713_1657725266276_hpMain_16x9_992-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/echard-evans-abc-rc-220713_1657725266276_hpMain_16x9_992-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/echard-evans-abc-rc-220713_1657725266276_hpMain_16x9_992-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/echard-evans-abc-rc-220713_1657725266276_hpMain_16x9_992-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clayton Echard and Gabby Windey didn&#8217;t work out as a couple.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Echard previously admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clayton-echard-reveals-suicidal-thoughts-says-susie-evans-saved-me/">having had suicidal thoughts</a> and has shared videos of himself dancing for the camera since 2023.</p>



<p>“[Dancing] has brought so much self love and self confidence that I’m truly so grateful to have found something that I get to work on myself every day and challenge myself,” he said.</p>



<p>“I’m not the greatest at it and I’m aware of that, I’m not delusional but it’s me versus me every single day I get into that studio and it’s movement therapy and it’s allowed me to release a lot of my anger and frustrations.”</p>



<p>Clayton added that he hadn’t talked to Windey — who served as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a> alongside Recchia in 2022 — “in three years,” but that Windey continues “to take shots at me and it’s just unnecessary.”<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehollywoodgossip.com%2F2025%2F04%2Fclayton-echard-trashes-gabby-windey-youre-a-bully-leave-my-dancing-alone%2F&amp;t=Clayton%20Echard%20Trashes%20Gabby%20Windey%20as%20a%20%22BULLY%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/jay-north-cause-of-death-dennis-the-menace-star-passes-away-at-73/"></a></p>

<p>After the the aforementioned 2022 season wrapped up, Clayton garnered backlash over how he behaved. He was ridiculed for exposing his fantasy suite dates with Rachel and Gabby to Susie and claiming he loved them all.</p>



<p>To conclude her latest TikTok video, Gabby took a long pause before directing her comments at Clayton. </p>



<p>“Oh, I’m a mean girl?&#8221; she said. &#8220;As a straight, white man maybe you should do better with your power.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gabby-windey-and-robby-hoffman-are-married">Gabby Windey and Robby Hoffman are Married!</h2>



<p>On January 1, Gabby Windey married Robby Hoffman in a secret ceremony in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>As we reported at the time, the two began dating in the summer of 2023. </p>



<p>Gabby did not immediately share the news of her wedding. As we mentioned, it was a secret &#8212; at first.</p>

<p>However, on Wednesday, March 5, it was time. Gabby Windey took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG0S7eNRPVo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to share the exciting news, including a lengthy series of photos and short videos of everything from Robby Hoffman&#8217;s proposal to their wedding itself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Husband and wife!!&#8221; she captioned the post. Gabby included an emoji of two champagne glasses, an engagement ring emoji, and the wedding date: January 11, 2025.</p>



<p>The videos revealed that Gabby and Robby had walked down the aisle with who else but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-is-chappell-roan-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chappell Roan</a> playing. Specifically, &#8220;Hot To Go!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-gabby-windey-and-robby-hoffman-meet">How did Gabby Windey and Robby Hoffman meet?</h2>



<p>Gabby, who had been newly exploring her sexuality, had been outside of a lesbian event in Los Angeles in 2023. </p>



<p>She&#8217;d traveled there with a friend and ended up meeting Robby (her friend&#8217;s girlfriend was already a fan of the comedian). </p>



<p>According to Gabby, Robby had &#8220;mad game&#8221; and she fell for her almost immediately. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Gabby has dated some really <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/vinny-guadagnino-and-gabby-windey-we-have-such-great-chemistry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">irredeemably awful dudes</a> in the past. Dating Robby helped her to realize how much better things could be.</p>



<p>She soon found that her girlfriend brought a confidence to their relationship. Gabby was new to dating women, but quickly realized that they were a great fit.</p>



<p>Robby is a comedian. Other lesbians on social media have praised her as a role model, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/butchlesbians/comments/1aq9n5o/question_for_butches_who_got_top_surgery_but_are/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing to her</a> as a butch woman who&#8217;s had top surgery and uses she/her. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s always good to have a reminder that you don&#8217;t have to make your body or presentation conform to someone else&#8217;s expectations and can just be yourself.</p>

<p>Gabby told <em><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a63997073/gabby-windey-marries-robby-hoffman-secret-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a> </em>that she and Robby decided to elope during the horror of the Los Angeles wildfires. “We had just evacuated from the fires,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Literally cue Rihanna, ‘We found love in a hopeless place.’”</p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;What better time to get married than right now? Because if the world is ending, we want to be with each other.”</p>



<p>It started as an escape from the devastation. Then, a joke about marrying turned into the real deal.</p>

<p>Gabby Windey has found someone new to accept her figurative rose.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just now who many folks out there likely expected it to be.</p>



<p>Windey, who co-anchored The Bachelorette alongside Rachel Recchia last year, stopped by The View on Tuesday in order to provide an update on her personal life.</p>



<p>“I always just want to live my truth, and my story,” she said on air to open a surprising announcement.</p>

<p>Continued Windey:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have been seeing someone for a couple months, and I’ve been keeping it a little more private because it is a bigger story and a bigger conversation, because I’m dating a girl!”</p>



<p>Later the same day, Windey shared a collection of photos with her girlfriend, comedian and TV writer Robby Hoffman, via Instagram.</p>



<p>&#8220;Told you I’m a girls girl!!&#8221; she captioned the post.</p>

<p>As you can see directly above, the reality star also posted a shot of her kissing Hoffman on her Instagram Story, which Hoffman reposted, writing: </p>



<p>&#8220;Guys some news… I am gay.&#8221;</p>



<p>Windey was a suitor in Season 26 of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelor/">The Bachelor</a>, as one of the women vying for Clayton Echard’s affections. </p>



<p>She and Recchia both got screwed over on air by Echard and were then chosen to headline Season 19 of The Bachelorette, becoming the first duel leads in series history.</p>

But she won the hearts of viewers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The nurse ended her season of The Bachelorette engaged to Erich Schwer, but they’d ended their romance by November.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think life is just really busy for the both of us right now,” Windey told Fox News at the time. </p>



<p>“So, I understand their concern but we&#8217;re just kinda, you know, going forward with each of our individual interests and supporting each other from afar.&#8221;</p>



<p>Winde also finished second on Dancing with the Stars, an experience that caused her to meet Jersey Shore cast member Vinny Guadagnino.</p>



<p>There was speculation at one point that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/vinny-guadagnino-and-gabby-windey-we-have-such-great-chemistry/">Guadagnino and Windey were hooking up</a>.</p>

<p>Alas, that was all back then.</p>



<p>As for now?</p>



<p>“I think it was always a whisper in me that just got louder and louder, and I didn’t really know to pay attention to it,” Windey said on The View about her sexuality and how she feels these days. </p>



<p>“I think, you know, when this happens, there’s some shame, obviously, surrounding it.”</p>

<p>She added: </p>



<p>“So I think I had to, a little bit, navigate through the shame, like, what is it? Where is it coming from? </p>



<p>&#8220;But ultimately, like I said, I always just want to kind of like, do me, do what I want, figure it out later.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re so very happy for Gabby Windey that she has figured this out. We wish her the best of luck.</p>

<p>We know Vinny Guadagnino is into the gym. And tanning. And doing some laundry on occasion</p>



<p>But the long-time Jersey Shore star has also made it as clear as he possibly can of late:</p>



<p>The guy is <em>really</em> into former Bachelorette lead Gabby Windey!</p>



<p>For those unaware, Guadagnino and Windey were each participants on the latest season of Dancing of the Stars.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Amid filming of this reality competition, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/gabby-windey-responds-is-she-really-boning-vinny-guadagnino/">Vinny and Gabby started flirting</a> online as if they were in middle school.</p>



<p>“I’m filled with so many different emotions – excitement, fear, gratitude, and mourning that this experience will soon end. Thank you to everyone who has continued to support us and I hope to make you proud next week!!” wrote Windey after she advanced to the finale.</p>



<p>In response to this message in November, Guadagnino remarked:</p>



<p>“Good job babby mamma.”</p>



<p>And then Windey replied: “My main man.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Gabby initially said the C-listers were just friends when asked about their status, but she also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/gabby-windey-continues-to-thirst-for-vinny-guadagnino-hes-a-10/">continued to thirst after the MTV personality</a>.</p>



<p>At the People’s Choice Awards in December, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/gabby-windey-on-vinny-guadagnino-romance-rumors-were-gonna-smush-and-its-gonna-be-epic/">Gabby admitted that she was open to dating Vinny</a>.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a possibility,” she said at the time of a romance with Guadagnino. “I don’t know. We’ll all have to wait and see.”</p>



<p>She then proposed a variation on the “gym, tan, laundry” catchphrase from the early days of&nbsp;<em>Shore</em>, one that would enable Vin to continue using the famous “GTL” initials:</p>



<p>“Gabby, tan, laundry!” Windey suggested at this event.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gabby Windey answered questions about Vinny Guadagnino while attending the People&#8217;s Choice Awards. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So&#8230; where do things stand now between these celebrities?</p>



<p>“We have great chemistry,” <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vinny-guadagnino-gabby-windey-and-i-have-great-chemistry/">Guadagnino told Us of Windey</a> on January 24, while promoting the season 6 premiere of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.</p>



<p>Vinny continued: </p>



<p>“We’re both, like, comedians. So, that’s why we get along and that’s also why we flirt so much on Instagram because we have that same banter with each other.”</p>

But she might have won Vinny Guadagnino&#8217;s heart! (Photo via ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, Vinny emphasized, though?</p>



<p>“It takes a lot more for me than just, like, a couple Instagram comments to be dating someone.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I would go on a date with her &#8230; I would actually go to dinner with Gabby. It’s just that we just met, you know what I mean? It’s not like anything serious.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not yet at least!</p>

<p>Gabby, as you may know, split from fiance Erich Schwer in November after the latter proposed on ABC.</p>



<p>“A lot of you are reaching out with questions about me and Gabby. The reality is that we ultimately were not each other’s people — it’s hard when there isn’t one thing to put your finger on,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/erich-schwer-breaks-silence-on-gabby-windey-breakup-no-regrets-here/">Schwer wrote at the time</a>. </p>



<p>He added:</p>



<p>“We met in a very unique situation and in a very unique way and I’m grateful we did. I would never take it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>For several weeks now, rumors of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/gabby-windey-continues-to-thirst-for-vinny-guadagnino-hes-a-10/">romance between Gabby Windey and Vinny Guadagnino</a> have been circulating on social media.</p>



<p>Alas, at this point, it seems that those reports are nothing more than wishful thinking.</p>



<p>Gabby and Vinny met on the set of <em>Dancing With the Stars</em>, and while neither took home the trophy, their time on the show might still result in the two of them collaborating on a horizontal mambo that&#8217;s sure to impress the judges.</p>



<p>Windey, of course, is one of the co-stars of the most recent season of <em>The Bachelorette</em>.</p>

<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/erich-schwer-breaks-silence-on-gabby-windey-breakup-no-regrets-here/">Gabby broke things off with her winning suitor, Eric Schwer</a>, before becoming flirty with Vin on social media.</p>



<p>Vinny, by contrast, is one of the stars of the iconic MTV reality show <em>Jersey Shore</em>.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s not currently in a relationship, but he might soon be forced to get a restraining order against Angelina Pivarnick.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VInny&#8217;s not dating Angelina &#8230; but don&#8217;t tell her that. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Anyway, these two come from very different worlds, but fans have enjoyed watching them become increasingly friendly on Instagram.</p>



<p>Things have escalated quickly in recent weeks, and both parties have seemed to enjoy pushing the envelope in terms of their flirtations.</p>



<p>For example, when Windey recently called Guadagnino her &#8220;main man,&#8221; he upped the ante by calling her his &#8220;baby mama.&#8221;</p>

But she might have won Vinny Guadagnino&#8217;s heart! (Photo via ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Staten Island, that&#8217;s about as serious as a proposal.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, Vin captioned a pic, &#8220;Stop looking for the one…be the one, and let them all come to you&#8221; and Windey responded, &#8220;Omw [on my way].&#8221;</p>



<p>These two have made a point of avoiding direct questions about the nature of their relationship, but when Gabby attended the People&#8217;s Choice Awards this week, Laverne Cox asked her point-blank if she intends to date Vinny.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gabby Windey answered questions about Vinny Guadagnino while attending the People&#8217;s Choice Awards. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a possibility,&#8221; she shared.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll all have to wait and see.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then proposed a variation on the &#8220;gym, tan, laundry&#8221; catchphrase from the early days of <em>Shore</em>, one that would enable Vin to continue using the famous &#8220;GTL&#8221; initials:</p>



<p>&#8220;Gabby, tan, laundry!&#8221; Windey suggested.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Sounds pretty serious! Or, at least it would, were it not for the fact that Gabby appears to be kidding around about her  relationship with Vin.</p>



<p>When asked if any other potential suitors have been sliding into her DMs lately, Gabby jokingly (we think) replied, &#8220;Not enough.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;So if you need permission, now&#8217;s the time!&#8221; Windey added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vinny stars on Jersey Shore&#8230;and possibly in Gabby&#8217;s heart. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Shortly after the DWTS finale, Gabby was asked by reporters if she would consider dating Vinny.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I would at this point. I could use a pick-me-up,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>But that was weeks ago, and it seems that these two have yet to make any sort of real-world love connection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gabby Windey strikes a pose on her Instagram page. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>So are they just messing with us?</p>



<p>Or does DWTS really stand for &#8220;down with the smush&#8221;?!</p>



<p>We&#8217;re still holding out hope for a joint statement confirming that these two are an item!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>When Gabby Windey and Vinny Guadagnino met on the set of <em>Dancing With the Stars</em>, she was fresh from her stint as the Bachelorette and her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/erich-schwer-breaks-silence-on-gabby-windey-breakup-no-regrets-here/">breakup with Eric Schwer</a>.</p>



<p>Vinny was probably fresh from a gig at the Vegas Chippendales revue, where he had drizzled a gallon of nether-region sweat all over a bachelorette party from Des Moines.</p>



<p>But despite their very different backgrounds, it seems the Colorado nurse and the Staten Island-based professional guido have hit it off.</p>



<p>And luckily for us, their budding romance is playing out in public.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Yes, Gabby and Vinny&#8217;s flirty exchanges on social media have fans doing more shipping than an Amazon warehouse on Cyber Monday.</p>



<p>Take for example the back-and-forth that took place earlier this week, in which Vinny and Gabby yet again made it clear that there&#8217;s a smush room rendezvous in their future.</p>



<p>It all started when Vinny posted an Instagram video in which he performed a short dance routine (as he&#8217;s wont to do these days).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Vinny stars on Jersey Shore&#8230;and possibly in Gabby&#8217;s heart. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Ya’ll need to get with a strong 7/8 with a good personality. If he’s too hot he’s not gonna be funny or cook,” Guadagnino captioned the video, adding:</p>



<p>“When you’re medium hot but somebody fine likes you.”</p>



<p>“Honestly a 10,&#8221; Gabby promptly commented on the clip.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="721" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM-1024x721.png" alt="" class="wp-image-463506" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM-1024x721.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM-300x211.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM-768x541.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM-1536x1081.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png 1642w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Gabby Windey didn&#8217;t win Dancing With the Stars. But she might have won Vinny Guadagnino&#8217;s heart! (Photo via ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gabby didn&#8217;t even do the thing where she was like, &#8220;He&#8217;s a 10, but &#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>In her mind, there are no qualifications or mitigating factors to Vinny&#8217;s status as a perfect dime!</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, Vin posted a sultry pic of himself (below), with a caption reading, “If I’m a lot, go find less.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Windey took to the comments again, this time replying, “A lot of you is never enough.”</p>



<p>Despite the constant flirtation between these two, Gabby insisted in a recent interview that they&#8217;re just friends who like to joke around.</p>



<p>“I mean, we’re friends. We were on [Dancing With the Stars] together,” she explained during a recent episode of Barstool&#8217;s “Chicks in the Office” podcast. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Apparently both of us just like to kind of stir the pot. Which is, like, funny. But [the rumors] did happen out of nowhere,&#8221; Gabby said, by way of explaining the flirty exchanges.</p>



<p>“All of a sudden … everybody’s blowing up in the comments,” she said, joking that she was prepared to be a “Guido in training.”</p>



<p>Then again, when asked by reporters at the DWTS finale whether she would consider dating Vin, Gabby had this to say:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Vinny seems confused in this still from Jersey Shore. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“I would at this point. I could use a pick me up.”</p>



<p>But if anything is gonna happen between these two, it probably won&#8217;t be for a while, as Gabby seems like she&#8217;s still getting over Erich.</p>



<p>“The end of our relationship happened because we weren’t completely in step and in sync with each other in our common goals or just the way we approach life,”<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gabby-windey-gets-flirty-with-vinny-guadagnino-after-erich-split/"> she recently remarked</a> to <em>Us Weekly</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>It&#8217;s all over for Gabby Windey and Erich Schwer. Is anyone out there really shocked?</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I’m just grateful that I was able to do it on my own terms and when I was ready,” Gabby added.</p>



<p>“It was just a new experience overall — being so public and being thrown into this. I think now it’s just kind of trying to move forward.”</p>



<p>So it sounds like Vinny might have to wait a bit before he makes his move.</p>



<p>Fortunately, patience is one of the Four Noble Virtues of the Chippendale!</p>

<p>Gabby Windey and Vinny Guadagnino come from two very different worlds:</p>



<p>She&#8217;s a midwestern nurse who&#8217;s eager to find the right man, settle down, and start a family.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a Staten Island-born Chippendale dancer, whose heart belongs to his doting mother and whatever lucky lady he happens to be gyrating on at the moment.</p>



<p>And yet, it seems that against all odds&#8211; and despite the fact that Gabby is a couple inches taller than Vin &#8212; these two might be on the verge of forming a legit love connection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/dancing-with-the-stars-crowns-brand-new-champion-it-happened-so-fast/">Charli D&#8217;Amelio took home the top prize</a> on <em>Dancing With the Stars</em> Season 31, but Gabby and Vinny both performed quite well, and they appear to have hit it off over the course of the competition.</p>



<p>Gabby came in second place, and she while she didn&#8217;t win the mirrored disco ball trophy, she might have won Vinny&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/gabby-windey-responds-is-she-really-boning-vinny-guadagnino/">Windey and Guadagnino have been exchanging flirty comments</a> on Instagram, so it comes as no surprise that reporters were quick to ask about the relationship between the two reality stars following last night&#8217;s finale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Gabby Windey pose at a Paris cafe. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Oh my god. Oh, wow, you guys get right to it. Yeah, I would at this point. I could use a pick-me-up,” <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/11/21/gabby-windey-date-vinny-guadagnino-interview/">Gabby replied</a>, according to Hollywood Life.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know if or when Vinny will make his move, but it certainly seems like the interest is mutual.</p>



<p>“Stop looking for the one…be the one, and let them all come to you,” Guadagnino recently captioned a photo of himself on Instagram. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Vinny stars on Jersey Shore&#8230;and possibly in Gabby&#8217;s heart. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The post prompted Gabby to comment, “Omw [on my way].”</p>



<p>The flirtation has been going both ways, with Vinny suggestively congratulating Gabby on her DWTS success.</p>



<p>“We’re going to finale!!!!! I’m filled with so many different emotions – excitement, fear, gratitude, and mourning that this experience will soon end,&#8221; Windey captioned a recent post.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you to everyone who has continued to support us and I hope to make you proud next week!!” </p>



<p>&#8220;Good job baby mamma,&#8221; Vinny replied.</p>



<p>“My main man,&#8221; Gabby wrote back.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Vinny looks unhappy here. He&#8217;s usually a pretty jolly dude. (Photo via MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/erich-schwer-breaks-silence-on-gabby-windey-breakup-no-regrets-here/">Gabby broke up with Eric Schwer </a>after her season of <em>The Bachelorette</em> came to a conclusion, so we know she&#8217;s available.</p>



<p>But is she looking to get serious with Vinny?</p>



<p>“I mean we’re friends,” Gabby said in response fo Vin-related questions on Barstool&#8217;s &#8220;Chicks in the Office&#8221; podcast. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Apparently both of us just like to kind of stir the post. Which is, like, funny. But [the buzz] did happen out of nowhere.”</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s possible that Gabby and Vinny are just having some stringing their fans along.</p>



<p>At first, Gabby&#8217;s followers were worried that Vinny would hurt her &#8230;</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8230; But it&#8217;s starting to sound like the people who are shipping Gabby and Vinny are gonna be the ones who wind up with broken hearts!</p>



<p>Hey, we&#8217;ll get over it &#8212; as long as Vinny doesn&#8217;t do something drastic and start hooking up with Angelina!</p>

<p>As previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/another-bachelorette-break-up-gabby-windey-confirms-split-from-erich-schwer/">Gabby Windey is no longer dating Erich Schwer</a>.</p>



<p>The Bachelorette and her chosen suitor recently called off their engagement.</p>



<p>But it now appears as if Windey might not be single for very long, considering all the flirtatious remarks flying back and forth these days between the reality star and&#8230; Vinny Guadagnino?!?</p>



<p>Yup.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Gabby and Vinny have gotten to know each other on the latest season of Dancing with the Stars.</p>



<p>Just how <em>well</em> has she gotten to know him, though?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the question we must ask ourselves after the season 19 Bachelorette posted an Instagram clip this week of her semifinals performance with partner Val Chmerkovskiy.</p>



<p>“We’re going to finale!!!!!” she wrote on Tuesday, November 15.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="639" height="489" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-462924" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-300x230.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-335x256.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-347x266.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-520x398.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /><figcaption>Ah, happier times. Erich Schwer proposes here to Gabby Windey on The Bachelorette finale.</figcaption></figure>



<p> She added:</p>



<p>“I’m filled with so many different emotions – excitement, fear, gratitude, and mourning that this experience will soon end. Thank you to everyone who has continued to support us and I hope to make you proud next week!!”</p>



<p>In response to this message, Guadagnino remarked: </p>



<p>“Good job babby mamma.&#8221;</p>



<p>And then Windey replied: “My main man.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>That wasn&#8217;t the end of it, however. That same day, Gabby commented on one of the Jersey Shore star&#8217;s social media uploads.</p>



<p>“stop looking for the one…be the one, and let them all come to you,” Vinny captioned a certain snapshot.</p>



<p>“Omw,” Windey wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Appearing on the “Chicks in the Office” podcast on Friday, Windey was asked about these exchanges and said the buzz surrounding them has been &#8220;hilarious to watch.&#8221;</p>



<p>As for where she and Vinny stand?</p>



<p>“I mean, we’re friends. We were on [Dancing With the Stars] together. Apparently both of us just like to kind of stir the pot. </p>



<p>&#8220;Which is, like, funny. But [the rumors] did happen out of nowhere.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>So&#8230; there we have it, we guess. At least for now.</p>



<p>On a previous episode of Dancing with the Stars, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/gabby-windey-finally-speaks-on-stunning-erich-schwer-split/">Gabby confirmed she has split from Schwer</a>.</p>



<p>“The end of our relationship happened because we weren’t completely in step and in sync with each other on our common goals or just the way we approach life,&#8221; she said on air, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;We weren’t each other’s best match.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>It&#8217;s all over for Gabby Windey and Erich Schwer. Is anyone out there really shocked?</figcaption></figure>



<p>Schwer, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/erich-schwer-breaks-silence-on-gabby-windey-breakup-no-regrets-here/">later broke his silence on their break-up</a> via a lengthy social media message.</p>



<p>“A lot of you are reaching out with questions about me and Gabby. </p>



<p>&#8220;The reality is that we ultimately were not each other’s people — it’s hard when there isn’t one thing to put your finger on.</p>



<p>&#8220;We met in a very unique situation and in a very unique way and I’m grateful we did. I would never take it back.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Concluded Erich:</p>



<p>&#8220;Gabby is an amazing person and she is doing amazing things. I will always root for her and I hope she gives them hell in the DWTS finale. … </p>



<p>&#8220;I am hoping to take this time with my family and loved ones and focus on myself. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have been working hard these past few months and I’m excited to share with y’all eventually.</p>

<p>Yes, Bachelor Nation.</p>



<p>It really is over.</p>



<p>A day after former Bachelorette lead <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/gabby-windey-finally-speaks-on-stunning-erich-schwer-split/">Gabby Windey confirmed that she was no longer engaged</a> to Erich Schwer, the former suitor himself has come out and issued a statement of his own.</p>



<p>This marks the first time he has spoken out in public about the split.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="639" height="489" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-462924" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-300x230.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-335x256.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-347x266.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/11/Erich-Schwer-and-Gabby-Windey-copy-520x398.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /><figcaption>Ah, happier times.

<p>No regrets and, it sounds like as well, no hard feelings on either end here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>It&#8217;s all over for Gabby Windey and Erich Schwer. Is anyone out there really shocked?</figcaption></figure>



<p>The real estate agent went on to praise Windey, referring to her &#8220;an amazing person,&#8221; and stating that he will always root for the Bachelorette lead. </p>



<p>&#8220;I hope she gives them hell in the DWTS finale,&#8221; Erich continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have learned and grown so much this year from experiences and mistakes and I continue to better myself everyday.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Erich &#8212; who came under some fire <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/eric-schwer-to-gabby-windey-sorry-for-the-side-piece-it-wont-happen-again/">this summer for a cheating scandal</a> wrapped up the post by sharing that he is taking time with friends and family &#8230; while also focusing on himself: </p>



<p>&#8220;I have been working hard these past few months and am I&#8217;m excited to share with y&#8217;all eventually.&#8221;</p>



<p>Schwer and Windey got engaged on the September Bachelorette finale.</p>



<p>It seemed like a perfect match at the time, but, like so many Bachelor Nation couples before them, the stars were unable to keep the romance going once the cameras were off.</p>

And yet&#8230; questions remain over their future.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For her part, Gabby opened up on Dancing with the Stars this past Monday evening, explaining to partner Val Chmerkovskiy why the song &#8220;I Am Kissing You” meant a great deal to her.</p>



<p>“For me, it holds a special place because I did just go through a breakup,” Windey said on air, acknowledging in public for the first time her split from Erich Schwer.</p>



<p>“The end of our relationship happened because we weren’t completely in step and in sync with each other on our common goals or just the way we approach life.</p>



<p>“We weren’t each other’s best match.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Sounds pretty similar to what Erich said, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>Earlier this month, a source told E! News that Gabby and Erich had gone their separate ways and it was Gabby to be the one to end the romance.</p>



<p>&#8220;She felt they weren&#8217;t aligned and weren&#8217;t on the same page,&#8221; the insider said, concluding at the time: </p>



<p>&#8220;Gabby was hoping they could give each other space and work it out but ultimately decided they didn&#8217;t have a future.</p>

<p>Gabby Windey has broken her silence.</p>



<p>On the November 14 episode of Dancing with the Stars, the former Bachelorette lead and professional partner Val Chmerkovskiy were preparing their waltz routine (to Des&#8217;ree&#8217;s &#8220;I Am Kissing You&#8221;) when the former decided to open way up.</p>



<p>She explained on air why the song meant so much to her.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;For me, it holds a special place because I did just go through a breakup,&#8221; Gabby said, acknowledging in public for the first time <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/another-bachelorette-break-up-gabby-windey-confirms-split-from-erich-schwer/">her split from Erich Schwer</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The end of our relationship happened because we weren&#8217;t completely in step and in sync with each other on our common goals or just the way we approach life. </p>



<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t each other&#8217;s best match.&#8221;</p>

<p>While dancing through an admittedly challenging time, Gabby pointed to the positive role models in her life as inspiration, telling Val: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just so grateful that my dad and my stepmom encompass so many fundamentals and values that I look for in a relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>As she and Chmerkovskiy got ready to hit the dance floor, Gabby told her partner that she wants to &#8220;channel that kind of everlasting love in this dance.&#8221;</p>

And yet&#8230; questions remain over their future.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Windey and Schwer got engaged during The Bachelorette season 19 finale, which aired in September.</p>



<p>“When I met you, I, like, immediately was 100 percent myself. I’ve never met anybody that I felt that comfortable with — that deep of a connection. I felt like I really knew you for years,” Schwer said as part of his proposal.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know it, but I had met my soulmate. … You are the most amazing person I’ve ever met. It’s you and me until the wheels fall off. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m head over heels in love with you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The couple said on ABC&#8217;s After the Final Rose special that they were taking things day by day after a woman released text messages this summer she claimed were sent to her by Schwer.</p>



<p>These messages made it sound very much as if <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/eric-schwer-to-gabby-windey-sorry-for-the-side-piece-it-wont-happen-again/">Erich was only going on The Bachelorette for clout</a>, and wanted this ex-girlfriend to wait for him upon his return from filming.</p>



<p>Awkward, huh?!?</p>



<p>“I do not have any hard feelings for this girl. It’s a mistake I made on my part. … I was using the show as an excuse to not confront her about our relationship,&#8221; Erich said about the scandal in September. </p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t see a future but we were having fun… I love [Gabby] with all my heart. 100 percent real. I never expected it. I want this to be forever.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Back on October 31, meanwhile, following a previous Dancing with the Stars taping, Gabby addresses her romantic status with Fox News.</p>



<p>“Life is just really busy for the both of us right now,” she said, sparking rumors about a potential breakup before the news was confirmed. </p>



<p>“I understand their concern but we’re just kind of, you know, going forward with each of our individual interests and supporting each other from afar.”</p>



<p>Windey served as the Bachelorette alongside co-lead Rachel Recchia, who was briefly engaged to final pick Tino Franco. </p>



<p>The twosome split ahead of After the Final Rose when the 28-year-old contractor admitted to cheating on the 26-year-old pilot.</p>
