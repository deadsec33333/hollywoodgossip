<p>Robbie Williams is British pop royalty, and he was hoping to score a worldwide hit with his recent biopic <em>Better Man</em>.</p>



<p>Robbie&#8217;s movie may not have been a box office smash, but steadily drumming up global word of mouth, even from people who have never heard of Take That. While the film is a traditional biopic in that it tells the singer&#8217;s life story, it also comes with one very bizarre caveat.</p>



<p>Instead of an actor playing Robbie (or the man even playing himself), the singer is portrayed as a CGI anthropomorphic chimpanzee, making it seem more like a <em>Planet of the Apes </em>film rather than <em>Walk the Line.</em></p>

<p>Robbie does use his voice in the movie, but the monkey was performed by Jonno Davies, using a motion capture suit. Jonno also does some voice work for the film. </p>



<p>Before you catch Robbie in <em>Better Man</em>, there are plenty of key facts you should know about him going in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robbie-williams-was-a-member-of-the-boy-band-take-that">Robbie Williams Was a Member of the Boy Band Take That</h2>



<p>Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Robbie began his career as a performer in school plays. In 1990, he joined the boy band Take That, when he was 16 years old.</p>



<p>Robbie sang the lead on many of the group&#8217;s early hits, like &#8220;Could It Be Heaven&#8221; and &#8220;I Found Heaven.&#8221; As the group skyrocketed to fame, Robbie&#8217;s drug use created rifts within the band, and he left in 1995. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-1024x683.jpg" alt="Robbie Williams attends the Golden Globes First-Time Nominee Celebration at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on December 17, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. " class="wp-image-516555" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190449126-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Robbie Williams attends the Golden Globes First-Time Nominee Celebration at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on December 17, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After leaving the group, Robbie pursued a very successful solo career, but he did rejoin Take That in 2010 for their album <em>Progress.</em> He toured with the band in 2011, and he&#8217;s made multiple appearances at shows over the years.</p>



<p>Despite rejoining the band, Robbie has not performed on any of the three Take That albums that followed 2010&#8217;s <em>Progress</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robbie-williams-has-released-12-solo-albums">Robbie Williams Has Released 12 Solo Albums</h2>



<p>After leaving Take That in the 90s, Robbie kicked off a solo career by covering &#8220;Freedom&#8221; by George Michael. In September 1997, he released his debut solo album <em>Life Thru a Lens</em>. </p>



<p>Since going solo, Robbie has released an impressive 12 albums, with his most recent being 2019&#8217;s <em>The Christmas Present</em>. Many of his records have been certified hits, and he&#8217;s become one of the best-selling artists of all time.</p>

<p>While Robbie may not be a total household name in the United States, he is a genuine star across the globe. In 2006, he broke the Guinness World Record for most tickets sold in a day for his world tour, but that record has since been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-gave-eras-tour-team-197-million-in-bonuses-ridiculous-generous-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken by Taylor Swift</a>, via<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/taylor-swift-concludes-record-breaking-eras-tour-epic/story?id=116531428#:~:text=Swift's%20record%2Dbreaking%20tour%20grossed,%241%20billion%2C%20according%20to%20Pollstar." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>ABC News</em>.</a></p>



<p>Robbie has been an incredible success in the UK. He is credited with four out of the 60 top-selling albums of all-time in the UK, according to <em><a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-best-selling-albums-of-all-time-on-the-official-uk-chart__15551/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Official Charts.</a></em> That includes both solo albums and Take That records.</p>



<p>Robbie has also won 18 Brit Awards, making him the person with the most of those accolades. As for American awards, he&#8217;s been nominated for two Grammys, but he didn&#8217;t win either.</p>

<p>In the same way that many singers have mentored younger artists by appearing as judges on <em>American Idol</em> or <em>The Voice</em>, Robbie did so on the famed British <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2007/03/simon-cowell-lays-into-britney-spears-robbie-williams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talent competition <em>The X Factor</em>.</a></p>



<p>In 2018, Robbie was named as one of the judges on the reality show alongside Simon Cowell, One Direction&#8217;s Louis Tomlinson, and his own wife Ayda Field.</p>



<p>This was not the &#8220;Angels&#8221; singer&#8217;s first appearance on <em>The X Factor</em>. He also performed on the program in 2009.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-s-dated-spice-girls">He&#8217;s Dated Spice Girls</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-1024x683.jpg" alt="Robbie Williams attends Chopard ART Evening at the Martinez on May 23, 2023 in Cannes, France." class="wp-image-516557" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1492697356-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Robbie Williams attends Chopard ART Evening at the Martinez on May 23, 2023 in Cannes, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images for Chopard)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a teen idol, Robbie&#8217;s personal life certainly drummed up a bit of public interest. &#8217;90s kids, brace yourselves, because he&#8217;s dated two Spice Girls.</p>



<p>He had a brief romance with Melanie Chisholm (&#8220;Sporty Spice&#8221;) in 1997. He had another short romance with Geri Halliwell (&#8220;Ginger Spice&#8221;) in 2000, per <em><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-clarifies-whether-he-actually-slept-with-four-spice-girls-2177579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NME</a></em>. </p>



<p>Robbie has caught some heat for making a joke about getting intimate with some Spice Girls, which he later apologized for in an interview with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5141958/robbie-williams-slept-with-spice-girls-three-four/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Sun</em>.</a> He clarified that it was simply a &#8220;joke.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was on stage and I was about to sing &#8216;Back For Good&#8217; and I said, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I’m very fortunate I’m one of the only people in the world that can say&nbsp;they’ve been in Take That&nbsp;and four out of five of the Spice Girls,'&#8221; he said.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2192681680-683x1024.jpg" alt="Robbie Williams and Ayda Field attend the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.

<p>Some of the Spice Girls did come forward to let the public know that they did not sleep with him. &#8220;For the record I haven’t. I really haven’t. I said four out of five because it was good for the joke,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Robbie&#8217;s other relationships over the years have also made headlines. In the late 90s, he dated and was even engaged to fellow singer Nicole Appleton.</p>



<p>Robbie <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2010/08/robbie-williams-and-ayda-field-married/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been married</a> to American actress Ayda Field since 2010, and they have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2012/03/robbie-williams-and-ayda-field-expecting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four children together.</a></p>

<p>Robbie&#8217;s CGI chimpanzee biopic may strike some viewers as strange, but the hitmaker does have a penchant for the abnormal.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Rock DJ&#8221; popstar was featured in a documentary where he and filmmaker Jon Ronson ventured to a UFO convention in Nevada, per <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/robbieandjonjourney.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a>.</em> </p>



<p>Robbie has opened up about his interests in the otherworldly and experiences with the paranormal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/19/popandrock.spaceexploration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a>. He also claimed to have had an alien encounter in a 2024 interview on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg07NPV1RWk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loose Women. </a></em></p>



<p>Needless to say, the man&#8217;s life story has the makings of a very interesting biopic!</p>

<p>The couple, who met back in 2006, <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/showbiz/901148/Secrets-of-Robbie-Williams-wedding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchanged vows</a> Saturday in front of about 75 friends and family members at the UK pop star&#8217;s Beverly Hills home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ceremony was very beautiful and romantic,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, Rob is happy,&#8221; the star&#8217;s dad, Pete Conway, told the <em>News of the World</em>. &#8220;That&#8217;s what you want for your kids. This is the happiest I&#8217;ve seen him. Ayda is so beautiful, so delightful, so lovely and just so right for him. They are brilliant together.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Music mogul <a href="/2007/01/simon-wishes-paula-would-lay-off-the-booze/">Simon Cowell</a> has blasted troubled stars Britney Spears and Robbie Williams for checking into rehab, insisting they have no idea of what hard life really is.</p>
<p>The outspoken <a href="http://www.americanidolworship.com/"><em>American Idol</em></a> judge recently visited an impoverished nation, and after witnessing the horrific conditions people are forced to live in, he believes Spears and Williams&#8217; problems pale in comparison.</p>


<p>Spears, who appears to have <a href="/2007/02/insane-britney-spears-rumors-from-the-rehab-clinic/">lost her mind</a>, is currently in Promises in Malibu, Calif., following months of hard drinking and partying, while Williams is seeking treatment for an addiction to painkillers at The Meadows clinic in Arizona.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>&#8220;This whole thing is a total indulgence. Britney and <a href="/stars/robbie-williams.html">Robbie Williams</a> need to get a grip,&#8221; Cowell said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on in Britney&#8217;s head, but my attitude is I couldn&#8217;t care less. She should go back and live with her mum for six months.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/2007/03/simon-cowell-lays-into-britney-spears-robbie-williams/thats-a-shaved-head/" rel="attachment wp-att-5750" title="That's a Shaved Head"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I went to a deprived part of the world recently&#8230; It really opened my eyes. You can feel sorry for yourself over the smallest things, but then you look at the world and you think, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got nothing to complain about.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So when I hear about the Robbies and the Britneys <a href="/2007/02/third-times-the-charm-britney-back-in-rehab/">checking into rehab</a>, I think, &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you what rehab is. Go to where I just went, where people are really suffering, and then you&#8217;ll see just how good your life is.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean <a href="/2007/03/britney-spears-leaves-rehab-temporarily/">Britney Spears</a> is not working in a coal mine is she? You are whisked to the studio in a very large limo, you are flown around in private jet, everyone will agree with you, and physically making an album is a doddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, Simon hit the nail on the head. Much like when he came to defense of <a href="/categories/antonella-barba/">Antonella Barba</a>. His comments about Britney may seem harsh, but hey, the truth hurts sometimes.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt Britney could use six months out of the public eye, just spending time with <a href="/2007/02/jayden-james-sean-preston-visit-britney-spears-in-rehab/">Sean Preston</a> and <a href="/gallery/stars/jayden-james-federline/">Jayden James</a>. Don&#8217;t hate Simon for saying what we&#8217;re all thinking.</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2007/03/simon-cowell-lays-into-britney-spears-robbie-williams/">Simon Cowell Lays Into Britney Spears, Robbie Williams</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>
