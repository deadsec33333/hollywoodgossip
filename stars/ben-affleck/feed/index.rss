<p>Jennifer Lopez is reportedly fuming over Ben Affleck in the wake of their split.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just post-breakup bitterness. She apparently feels &#8220;betrayed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cozy glimpses of her recent ex-husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-spark-reconciliation-rumors-after-embracing-in-public/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Jennifer Garner</a> made the rounds, inciting jokes and praise alike.</p>



<p>Lopez saw them, too. And it sounds like she&#8217;s <em>not </em>happy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yes-jennifer-lopez-saw-ben-affleck-being-so-cozy-with-the-other-jen">Yes, Jennifer Lopez saw Ben Affleck being so cozy with the other Jen</h2>



<p>According to a new report, Jennifer Lopez is reeling from Ben Affleck&#8217;s recent cozy photos with his <em>other </em>famous A-list Jennifer ex-wife, Jennifer Garner.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner went on a recent outing with their shared children.</p>



<p>However, a video captured the two embracing. Seeing her ex with his other ex reportedly stirred up doubts and more in Jennifer Lopez, despite their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-finalized-who-got-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized divorce</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;[JLo] saw the paintballing images when the rest of the world did,&#8221; an inside source told <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14466097/Jennifer-Lopez-betrayed-Ben-Affleck-Garner-video-sexy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;And of course it will make her question things from their time together,&#8221; the insider continued.</p>



<p>The source added: &#8220;Her friends have questioned how platonic Jen [Garner] and Ben are.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-1024x746.jpg" alt="Jennifer Lopez on January 4, 2025." class="wp-image-520916" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-768x560.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-2048x1493.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-960x700.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-1080x787.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jenniferlopez_02-1200x875.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez attends Variety presents The Creative Impact Awards and 10 Directors To Watch Brunch at Parker Palm Springs on January 04, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perhaps-jennifer-lopez-feels-like-she-put-a-lot-of-work-into-ben-affleck-only-for-another-ex-to-scoop-him-up">Perhaps Jennifer Lopez feels like she put a lot of work into Ben Affleck, only for another ex to scoop him up?</h2>



<p>&#8220;She will feel betrayed,&#8221; the insider then claimed about Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Garner.</p>



<p>This, the source explained, is &#8220;because she invested so much time in supporting Ben through his challenges.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider added that Lopez did all of that &#8220;and had a rough year as their marriage broke down.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="744" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-1024x744.jpg" alt="Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck on February 24, 2013." class="wp-image-520917" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-300x218.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-768x558.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-2048x1488.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-960x698.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-1080x785.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0307_jennifergarner_01-1200x872.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Jennifer Garner and actor-director Ben Affleck arrive at the Oscars at Hollywood &amp; Highland Center on February 24, 2013.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The report goes on to allege that Jennifer Lopez has a sinking feeling about some of her concerns that she allegedly felt during their marriage. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were close, Lopez observed, due to their shared kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seeing how quickly he has started spending more time with Garner has exacerbated the concerns she already had,&#8221; the insider claimed.</p>



<p>The source explained that these were concerns that Lopez felt &#8220;about his relationship with her while they were married.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-that-mean-that-there-was-cheating">Does that mean that there was cheating?</h2>



<p>Some exes hate each other. Other exes get along well as friends. Either can describe exes who went through a famous divorce and share kids. Yes, even when one of them got a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/03/ben-affleck-lied-about-his-fake-back-tattoo-and-now-hes-getting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very silly back tattoo</a> in the aftermath.</p>



<p>If they seem cozy with each other years after they split, when both of them are single &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that they&#8217;re getting back together.</p>



<p>Could they? Sure. Jennifer Garner could put herself through that again. But Ben Affleck may have to find another Jennifer (not Lopez or Garner) this time.</p>

<p>It is, officially, all over between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.</p>



<p>The famous former spouses formally ended their marriage on Monday, January 6, according to documents obtained by various celebrity gossip and entertainment news outlets. </p>



<p>In doing so, both parties “agreed to divide all assets and liabilities” to avoid further litigation and expense.</p>



<p>Lopez, if you&#8217;ll recall, initiated this process back in August when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/">she filed to divorce Affleck</a> after two years as husband and wife.</p>

<p>Considering the combined wealth between these stars, this was a relatively clean, simple and amicable settlement.</p>



<p>Lopez, for example, keeps all of her personal belongings and earnings from their date of separation (listed as April 26, 2024), as well as half of the ex-couple&#8217;s shared bank accounts. </p>



<p>Affleck receives the same. </p>



<p>The actor also keeps his role and share in the production company Artists Equity, which he cofounded in November 2022 with best friend Matt Damon.</p>



<p>Per the agreement, Affleck and Lopez will divide their $60 million mansion in Beverly Hills that is now on the market.</p>

<p>In the divorce, Lopez retains her clothing, jewelry and “miscellaneous personal effects in her possession, custody or control,” and all assets that she owns “individually or by entities of which [Lopez] is the sole owner, member or shareholder.”</p>



<p>Having relied on mediation in September to come up with most of these terms, Lopez also requested to drop “Affleck” from her last name and restore her legal name to <em>Jennifer Lynn Lopez</em>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-reason/">Lopez-Affleck divorce</a> had been rumored for several weeks prior to the singer/actress finally making it a done deal this past summer.</p>



<p>The celebrities, of course, had first gotten together &#8212; and even gotten engaged &#8212; in the early 200s&#8230; only to break up&#8230; date and marry other people&#8230; get back together in May 2021&#8230; and then exchange vows in April 2022.</p>



<p>Now, at last, it appears as if their romantic journey has come to an end. We presume, at least.</p>

<p>About three months ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jennifer-lopez-finally-breaks-silence-on-ben-affleck-divorce/">Lopez broke her silence</a> on the end of this romance &#8212; although she didn&#8217;t cite Affleck by name or delve into any specifics.</p>



<p>“You have to be complete, if you want something that’s more complete,” Lopez told comedian Nikki Glaser in October, adding:</p>



<p>“You have to be good on your own. I thought I learned that, but I didn’t. And then, this summer, I had to be like, ‘I need to go off and be on my own. I want to prove to myself that I can do that&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;With everything that’s happened in my life and in my relationships and even in my career, it’s like, give yourself a bit of comfort and love.</p>



<p>“We’ve been through a lot of things that nobody knows about, and you’ve persevered and you refuse to give up and to let it get you down.”</p>

<p>Lopez was previously married to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998; Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003; and Marc Anthony 2004 to 2014. She shares twins Max and Emme with the latter. </p>



<p>Affleck, for his part, was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018.</p>



<p>They coparent their three kids, Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.</p>

<p>Ben Affleck is not letting his personal life get in the way of his professional life.</p>



<p>As you simply must be aware of by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/">Jennifer Lopez filed to divorce Affleck</a> in August&#8230; on the former couple&#8217;s two-year wedding anniversary.</p>



<p>We therefore don&#8217;t know exactly what Affleck thinks of his ex as a person these days.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="964" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-1024x964.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512529" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-1024x964.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-300x282.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-768x723.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-2048x1928.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-960x904.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-1080x1017.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2001188762-1200x1130.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck attend Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;This is Me&#8230; Now: A Love Story&#8221; premiere at the Dolby theatre in Hollywood, California, February 13, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Robyn BECK / AFP)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As an actress, however?</p>



<p>On November 3, Affleck say alongside Matt Damon for a video interview with Entertainment Tonight during which he was asked about the upcoming film Unstoppable, which Affleck produced and <em>in</em> which Lopez stars.</p>



<p>&#8220;Upstoppable is &#8230; rooted in the passion of really talented artists. [Director] Billy Goldenberg and Jennifer [Lopez] and Don Cheadle and Jharrel [Jerome], and Bobby Cannavale, all were really passionate about this film,&#8221; he responded.</p>



<p>Expounding on the stars of the movie, Affleck pointed out their emotional connection to the story, noting that, “Jennifer is spectacular.”</p>

<p>Affleck hasn&#8217;t said anything in public about the divorce.</p>



<p>Lopez, however, recently acknowledged the pair’s failed romance during an interview with Nikki Glaser for Interview magazine that was published on October 9.</p>



<p>“I think my whole life I’ve just been trying to say I’m good enough, until where I am now, when I know. I’m giving myself credit,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jennifer-lopez-finally-breaks-silence-on-ben-affleck-divorce/">said the star in a candid moment</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m telling that little girl that grew up in the Bronx, ‘You’ve done really good for yourself.’ I didn’t do that for so many years.</p>



<p>&#8220;And now I think, with everything that’s happened in my life and in my relationships and even in my career, it’s like, give yourself a bit of comfort and love. We’ve been through a lot of things that nobody knows about, and you’ve persevered and you refuse to give up and to let it get you down.”</p>

<p>Lopez did not cite Affleck by name in this discussion.</p>



<p>But she added at the time: </p>



<p>“There’s something to be said for that because things can really change your life in a way that you do want to give up and say, &#8216;F-ck this, this is too hard, I don’t want to do this anymore.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I’m not there. I refuse to not give myself everything that little girl deserves.”</p>

<p>The estranged spouses exchanged vows in front of friends and family in Georgia in August 2022 after quietly getting married in Las Vegas one month.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-reunite-hold-hands-kiss/">scant talk of reconciliation</a> between the two, but that now seems VERY unlikely.</p>



<p>The celebrities reportedly remain friendly amid their current situation, however. </p>



<p>“There’s still a lot of love between them,” an Us Weekly insider said this summer.</p>

<p>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck simply cannot quit each other.</p>



<p>Even when legal documents tell them they sort of have to.</p>



<p>In late August, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/">Lopez filed to divorce Affleck</a> of a summer spent scarcely with her famous husband in any way, shape or form.</p>



<p>It was a development the entire world saw coming.</p>

<p>On Saturday, however, the estranged spouses with spotted with their kids at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California.</p>



<p>And they weren&#8217;t simply hammering out the details of their impending divorce, according to an onlooker.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben and JLo are currently at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel holding hands and kissing. The kids are with them, but at a separate table,&#8221; an <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/09/14/celebrity-news/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-kissing-holding-hands-at-brunch-amid-divorce/">insider told Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>Yes, that really does say <strong><em>holding hands and kissing</em></strong>.</p>

<p>At another point, the superstars were photographed having what seemed to be an intense conversation in a car parked outside of the building.</p>



<p>Affleck’s children &#8212; Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12 &#8212; as well as Lopez’s 16-year old twins, Emme and Max, were also spotted with their parents insider of the hotel.</p>



<p>Adding to the confusion and/or the complexity?</p>



<p>Affleck’s ex-wife Jennifer Garner who was <em>ALSO</em> seen leaving the hotel with her kids after grabbing brunch. There just a whole lot going on here apparently, folks.</p>

<p>Lopez filed her divorce paperwork on what would have been the couple&#8217;s two-year wedding anniversary, citing irreconcilable differences as the basis for the split.</p>



<p>The singer/actress also cited April 26 as as the date of separation, which backed up widespread speculation over the past few months that Affleck and Lopez were basically done as a romantic item.</p>



<p>Affleck has been spotted with his wedding ring on in ages, while the pair even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-tracker-their-house-is-for-sale/">put their shared home up for sale</a> in June.</p>



<p>The stars first got together way back in 2002, only to get engaged and then call off the engagement two years later.</p>



<p>Each went on to have kids and get married to other people, reconciling in 2021 after Lopez broke off her romance with former steroid user Alex Rodriguez.</p>

<p>The two <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-did-not-sign-a-prenup-how-much-do-they-stand-to-lose/">reportedly didn’t sign a prenup</a> before they married, which could potentially lead to a battle over assets, including their aforementioned Beverly Hills mansion that they put up for sale for $68 million two-plus months ago.</p>



<p>Might Lopez and Affleck have simply been discussing this issue over the weekend?</p>



<p>Yes.</p>



<p>By at least one account, however, their tongues were doing a lot more than just talking. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>Are Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez <em>friends</em>? Stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>Like a man marrying two women of the same name back-to-back1</p>



<p>In August, Jennifer Lopez finally <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed to divorce Ben Affleck</a>. This followed months of hints, speculation, and (arguably) <em>hype</em>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Garner is</a> part of this story. Not in any salacious way. She&#8217;s not &#8220;the other woman.&#8221; But she has seemingly provided her ex with emotional support as he became J. Lo&#8217;s ex.</p>



<p>The <em>Jennifers </em>Garner and Lopez have enough common ground to be friends. But how do they actually feel about each other?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-jennifer-lopez-said-about-jennifer-garner">What has Jennifer Lopez said about Jennifer Garner?</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lopez-december-cover-2022-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 <em>Vogue </em>interview</a>, the then-newly-married Jennifer Lopez spoke about Jennifer Garner.</p>



<p>&#8220;[She&#8217;s] an amazing co-parent, and they work really well together,&#8221; she praised. Lopez, who is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-marriages-why-they-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no stranger to blended families</a>, found that things went very smoothly when she married Ben Affleck.</p>



<p>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner share Violet, Fin, and Samuel. Jennifer Lopez shares twins, Emme and Max, with ex-husband Marc Anthony.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="791" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-791x1024.jpg" alt="Jennifer Garner on July 25, 2024." class="wp-image-508408" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-232x300.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-768x995.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-1581x2048.jpg 1581w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-741x960.jpg 741w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-834x1080.jpg 834w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-927x1200.jpg 927w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0903_jennifergarner_01-scaled.jpg 1977w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Garner speaks onstage during &#8220;Marvel Studios: The Ultimate Deadpool &amp; Wolverine Celebration Of Life&#8221; panel during 2024 Comic-Con International at San Diego Convention Center on July 25, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lopez and Garner have participated in blended family activities together. For example,<em> </em><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-daughter-violet-graduation-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Marie Claire</em> reports</a> that Lopez showed up at Garner&#8217;s home as they all celebrated Violet&#8217;s graduation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this was after rumors of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s divorce were already circulating. In fact, it was several weeks after Lopez&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-details-honeymoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported date of separation</a>.</p>



<p>Clearly, everyone involved gathered together because they care about Violet. This was about her, not about either Jennifer or about Ben Affleck.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lopez-and-garner-may-have-bonded-as-co-parents">Lopez and Garner may have bonded as co-parents</h2>



<p>Co-parenting is not the same thing as being joined at the hip. However, sometimes people do bond over having dated the same person, even having married the same person. And, of course, over taking care of and loving the same children.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-garner-is-jennifer-lopezs-ally-amid-ben-affleck-marital-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to <em>Us Weekly</em></a>, it went further than that. A report claims that Jennifer Lopez found an &#8220;unexpected ally&#8221; and friend in Garner as this divorce unfolded.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been helpful to J.Lo, and they&#8217;ve been relating to each other,&#8221; an inside source claimed. &#8220;Jennifer has been a surprising person for J.Lo to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13652209/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-desperate-bid-save-marriage-divorce.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Daily Mail</em> claims</a> that Jennifer Garner was acting as a mediator, not just as an emotional support, as the couple&#8217;s issues worsened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jennifer is eternally grateful for her help even though she has now taken a step back,&#8221; a source alleged. &#8220;But Jen was able to get through to her ex-husband like no one else could &#8212; even her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, we know that Jennifer Garner provided friendship and comfort to not only Ben but to other family members, even spending time with his mother. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-their-relationship-like-now">What is their relationship like now?</h2>



<p>Complex relationships among friends, partners, and exes exist like this all of the time. Most just aren&#8217;t among celebrities, playing out in the spotlight.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we can guess that whether Lopez and Garner became true friends, it&#8217;s possible that they&#8217;ll see less of each other. A shared ex can bond people &#8212; or tear them apart. </p>



<p>Either way, it&#8217;s likely that the Jennifers may see each other in the future. Not only because they are both massive celebrities, but because they care about some of the same kids. We don&#8217;t know if Lopez will be going to any more Affleck graduation celebrations, of course. But if so, it&#8217;ll be good that she and Garner have this reported rapport.</p>

<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-did-not-sign-a-prenup-how-much-do-they-stand-to-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben and Jen did not sign a prenup</a> before they tied the knot in 2022.</p>



<p>And because of that baffling decision, it will not be easy for the exes to simply go their separate ways.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/26/no-prenup-complicates-jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce/#continued" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, very asset these two earned over the past years must now be divided equally.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s no easy feat. We&#8217;re talking about houses, cars, millions in earnings, and even a company that Ben started during that time.</p>

<p>In 2022, Ben teamed with Matt to launch Artists&#8217; Equity, a <a href="https://artistsequity.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production studio</a> that seeks, per its website, to &#8220;reimagine the relationship between talent, studio, and distributor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company has already produced Ben and Matt&#8217;s film <em>Air</em>, as well as <em>The Instigators</em>, starring Matt and Casey Affleck, and the upcoming <em>Unstoppable</em>, which stars Jen.</p>



<p>Because of the timing, the proceeds from those films and the company itself might all be up for grabs during the divorce.</p>



<p>That means that Matt&#8217;s stake could be affected. And he might be forced to weigh in at some point.</p>

<p>Hey, Matt and Ben have been a team for almost 30 years. Why shouldn&#8217;t they collaborate on Ben&#8217;s divorce?</p>



<p>We kid, of course. </p>



<p>The fact is, it was a testament to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/ben-affleck-divorced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben&#8217;s faith in his marriage</a> that he launched a new company four months after tying the knot.</p>



<p>And the fact that an entire production studio is community property is a reminder of how much is up for grabs in this divorce.</p>

<p>Thus far, Matt has not commented on his best friend&#8217;s very public breakup.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;ll probably continue to keep quiet &#8212; unless a judge forces him to testify in court.</p>



<p>Of course, Ben and Jen have both been in the spotlight for a very long time. </p>



<p>They&#8217;re obviously not on the greatest terms at the moment. But they&#8217;ll probably work hard to keep this split as private as possible.</p>

<p>It won&#8217;t be easy with all the wealth that&#8217;s currently at stake.</p>



<p>Jen and Ben obviously value their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-60-million-mansion-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beverly Hills mansion</a> and the millions they earned during their time together.</p>



<p>But they probably value their privacy even more.</p>

<p>Has Ben Affleck already moved on with a new girlfriend?</p>



<p>Sure, it&#8217;s been less than a week since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-reason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck</a>.</p>



<p>But the exes separated back in April, if not earlier. And insiders say Ben has spent much of that time with the daughter of a very well-known politician.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kick-kennedy-ben-affleck-s-new-girlfriend">Is Kick Kennedy Ben Affleck&#8217;s New Girlfriend?</h2>



<p>Kick Kennedy is the 36-year-old daughter of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/cheryl-hines-divorce-her-marriage-history-with-rfk-jr-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert F. Kennedy Jr</a>.</p>



<p>Until last week, RFK Jr. was an independent presidential candidate. But he recently dropped out of the race and threw his support behind Donald Trump.</p>



<p>Now, the family is back in the news, thanks to rumors that Ben and Kick are dating.</p>

<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/24/celebrity-news/ben-affleck-has-been-hanging-out-with-rfk-jr-s-daughter-kick-kennedy/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pagesix_news_alert&amp;utm_content=20240824?&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=P6%20-%20News%20Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>,</em> Ben and Kick have been hanging out since June.</p>



<p>One source tells the outlet that the couple has been making little effort to conceal their relationship.</p>



<p>In fact, they&#8217;ve been spotted at numerous Hollywood hot spots, including the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p>



<p>Neither party has commented publicly on the rumors that they&#8217;re romantically involved.</p>



<p>But reliable sources say there&#8217;s no doubt that they&#8217;re an item.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-ben-and-kick-getting-serious-already">Are Ben and Kick Getting Serious Already?</h2>



<p>Over the weekend, the popular gossip page <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1f0ewcy/deux_moi_confirms_that_ben_affleck_has_been_in_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deux Moi </a>chimed in and claimed that Ben and Kick were spotted leaving an apartment complex owned by &#8220;one of Ben&#8217;s A-list pals.&#8221;</p>



<p>A witness told the outlet that Ben and Kick have been acting &#8220;very couply,&#8221; and she&#8217;s been &#8220;leaving with a bag since at least June.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, to play fair to all parties involved, there are some outlets who claim to have sources saying quick the opposite. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/26/ben-affleck-rfk-daughter-kick-kennedy-not-dating/?adid=social-tw">TMZ</a></em> has insiders who insist there is nothing romantic going on with Ben and Kick, and that the two are just &#8220;buddies.&#8221;</p>



<p>But you know the old saying about where there&#8217;s smoke there&#8217;s fire? </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-there-any-overlap-between-ben-s-most-recent-relationships">Was There Any Overlap Between Ben&#8217;s Most Recent Relationships?</h2>



<p>Has Ben has really moved on so soon after his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/ben-affleck-divorced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split from J-Lo</a>? If so, then fans are bound to have some questions about his timing.</p>



<p>But no one is accusing Ben of cheating on Jen. </p>



<p>In fact, insiders seem to agree that the couple simply wanted different things and gradually grew apart as a result.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="751" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1253749368-2-1024x751.jpg" alt='Jennifer Lopez and US actor Ben Affleck arrive for the premiere of "The Mother" at the Westwood Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles, California, on May 10, 2023.

<p>“The kind of big love Jennifer believes in, that sort of all-consuming devotion? Ben played along for a while and wanted to be part of it, but it’s just not who he is,” one insider tells Page Six.</p>



<p>But while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-details-honeymoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the split might have been gradual</a>, that doesn&#8217;t mean the divorce will be amicable.</p>



<p>“She’s furious. He has humiliated her. He was the one who initiated getting back together,&#8221; says the source.</p>



<p>“He’s humiliated her because she made a big deal that he’s the love of her life.”</p>



<p>Ben and Kick might wind up putting their relationship to the test right off the bat. Because it sounds like he&#8217;s in for the fight of his life.</p>

<p>Is Jennifer Garner on a break from her longtime boyfriend, John Miller?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the claim being made in a surprising new report from <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/jennifer-garner-and-john-on-break-amid-ben-j-lo-divorce/?taid=66c658d8103e400001efc5b4&amp;utm_campaign=true_anthem_intouch&amp;utm_content=new&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>.</p>



<p>Of course, the rumor is especially interesting, given its timing.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce</a> from Garner&#8217;s ex-husband, Ben Affleck.</p>



<p>Ben has maintained close ties with his first wife in the years since their split. And they&#8217;ve been spotted together frequently in recent weeks.</p>



<p>So did the two breakups have anything to do with one another? Maybe —  but probably not in the way you&#8217;re thinking!</p>

<p>While rumors of an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/ben-affleck-divorced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Affleck-Garner reunion</a> might soon spread like wildfire on social media, there&#8217;s no reason to believe that any such reconciliation is in the cards.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-details-honeymoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben&#8217;s marital drama</a> hasn&#8217;t affected Jen&#8217;s relationship with John.</p>



<p>According to the <em>Life &amp; Style</em> report, Ben&#8217;s habit of treating Jen like his &#8220;personal therapist&#8221; has created tension in other areas of her life.</p>



<p>“Jen’s had so much going on with Ben, it just took a toll. And she and John ended up going their separate ways. It wasn’t her choice,&#8221; an insider told the outlet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-ben-responsible-for-jen-s-breakup">Is Ben Responsible For Jen&#8217;s Breakup?</h2>



<p>The source adds that “some friends have been saying” Jennifer and John’s split is “all Ben’s fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Jen can be very easy on Ben, but privately, even she admits he’s taken up a lot of her time – especially because they’ve had so much parenting to deal with,&#8221; says the insider, adding:</p>



<p>“Ben’s been turning to Jen [Garner] for advice and support, and that’s been a big source of annoyance for John. He doesn’t enjoy competing with her ex-husband for her attention.”</p>



<p>The source adds that Ben “basically made Jen into his personal therapist once he started having issues in his second marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She’s who he’d run to. But it got even worse after he left J. Lo. When he moved out, he got so incredibly needy,&#8221; the insider adds.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was one crisis after another, and when he’s in that state, Jen is always there for him without fail. John has finally had enough.”</p>



<p>The source claims that Jen&#8217;s friends are upset, as they thought that she and John made a perfect match.</p>



<p>“Jen’s inner circle really likes John and hopes they can get back on track one day,” says the insider said, adding that Jen&#8217;s “pals are still rooting for them.”</p>

<p>“Jen’s second chance at love has been ruined. Instead of blaming Ben, she takes full responsibility for her life — though her friends aren’t as forgiving.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-and-jen-s-complex-relationship">Ben and Jen&#8217;s Complex Relationship</h2>



<p>As for the rumors that Jen still has feelings for Ben, the source says they&#8217;re completely bogus. In fact, the insider explains, her willingness to be his shoulder to cry on was prompted largely by her concern for their kids:</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s got nothing to do with Jen having feelings for Ben — she’s not carrying some torch for him,” the source says. </p>



<p>“It comes down to what’s best for her kids. Jen is the type of mom who will always put their needs above her own.”</p>

<p>The issues that led to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/ben-affleck-divorced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck&#8217;s divorce</a> may have started as early as the couple&#8217;s 2022 honeymoon, according to new details shared.</p>



<p>Despite knowing exactly the kind of reaction the world has to Bennifer, it sounds like one half of the Hollywood power couple was uncomfortable with the amount of attention that came with being <em>so</em> famous in love.</p>



<p>Yet in spite of all of that, Ben and Jen spent the last two years married in front of the spotlight. </p>



<p>Even though that&#8217;s the last place he wanted to be. Oh yes, even though Jennifer filed the divorce papers, it was Ben who felt like the marriage just couldn&#8217;t work &#8211; even from the very start! </p>

<p>At least that&#8217;s the claim being made in a surprising new report from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/21/celebrity-news/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-started-having-marital-problems-on-their-lake-como-honeymoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Ben and Jen realized their mistake just days after they exchanged vows, and their post-nuptial jaunt to Lake Como, Italy was nothing short of disastrous.</p>



<p>“He was unhappy with paparazzi following them. She is an international superstar, and he acted like it came as a surprise that they would be followed around,” said one insider.</p>



<p>“They would barely speak to each other during what was supposed to be the happiest time of their life. He sold her on him being a changed man, and that lasted a very short time.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/ben-affleck-denies-being-drunk-at-the-grammys-this-is-why-people-hide-their-addictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben has struggled with alcoholism</a> throughout his life. And according to the source, it was in Lake Como that his relatively newfound sobriety “started to settle in with normality.”</p>

<p>“[Ben] was just getting sober,&#8221; says the insider. &#8220;He was in a vulnerable state, and whatever their chemistry played into that. He was in this frenzied, excitable state.&#8221;</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not easy for two newlywed A-listers to find peace and normalcy in the days after their high-profile wedding.</p>



<p>Apparently, Jen took the media attention in stride, but Ben saw it as an unwelcome harbinger of things to come.</p>

<p>But according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/jennifer-lopez-was-holding-out-hope-before-ben-affleck-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em> she and Ben have actually been living separate lives since at least March.</p>



<p>“This has been a long time coming. Jen and Ben have been separated since March when the marriage began to really fall apart and Ben asked for space,” an insider tells the outlet.</p>



<p>Jen hoped that the “space would help,&#8221; but she ultimately decided that &#8220;the marriage was not fixable.”</p>

<p>The source claims that by the time Jen filed, she and Ben were &#8220;only talking through lawyers.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Ben had no intention of working on things and the more time they spent apart the more clear it became to him that this marriage was a mistake,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-did-not-sign-a-prenup-how-much-do-they-stand-to-lose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben and Jen did <em>not</em> sign a prenup</a>, which means their divorce could get complicated.</p>



<p>But for now, it sounds like both parties are happy to begin the process of moving on.</p>

<p>Many fans have forgotten the full list of Jennifer Lopez marriages and why they all failed.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, August 20, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez filed to divorce Ben Affleck</a>.</p>



<p>This unsurprising <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/ben-affleck-divorced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce news</a> followed what we can only describe as many months of &#8220;hype.&#8221;</p>



<p>But this isn&#8217;t Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s first divorce. It isn&#8217;t even her first major split with Ben Affleck. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-marriages-has-jennifer-lopez-had">How many marriages has Jennifer Lopez had?</h2>



<p>Jennifer Lopez has been married four times. However, not all of her major relationships have been marriages.</p>



<p>Before her celebrity status, she had a relationship spanning nearly a decade with David Cruz, her high school sweetheart.</p>



<p>In the mid 1990s, they split. And this is when J Lo&#8217;s relationships within the entertainment world began.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jennifer-lopez-s-first-marriage-was-to-ojani-noa">Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s first marriage was to Ojani Noa</h2>



<p>In 1997, Jennifer Lopez married Ojani Noa. The Cuban model and producer was also a waiter (this is not especially unusual in a competitive industry like the Los Angeles entertainment industry).</p>



<p>The marriage only lasted 11 months. The two split in 1998.</p>



<p>Jennifer Lopez characterized the marriage as a mistake that she made while hoping to avoid feelings of loneliness. Ouch.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sean-diddy-combs">Sean &#8216;Diddy&#8217; Combs</h2>



<p>From 1999 to early 2001, Jennifer Lopez had an on-again, off-again relationship with Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs. Though people currently know him as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/diddy-model-files-lawsuit-claims-she-was-drugged-sexually-assaulted-by-disgraced-mogul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the very notorious Diddy</a>, at the time, he went by &#8220;Puff Daddy.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/diddy-on-the-run-did-the-embattled-hip-hop-mogul-flee-the-us-following-raids-on-his-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s notoriety</a> was less sensational at the turn of the millennium, but authorities arrested him and Jennifer Lopez for possession of a weapon after they left the scene of a shooting in Times Square. Though the charges against Lopez dropped almost immediately, that was part of the drama that drove her to break up with him.</p>



<p>Additionally, Lopez would go on to say that she felt &#8220;crazy&#8221; due to his alleged infidelity during their relationship. It was, she shared, the first time that she was with someone whom she suspected of cheating on her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jennifer-lopez-s-second-marriage-was-to-cris-judd">Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s second marriage was to Cris Judd</h2>



<p>In September 2001, Jennifer Lopez married her former backup dancer, Cris Judd. (Yes, they married a few weeks after 9/11)</p>



<p>Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce in July of 2002. Some whirlwind romances lead to whirlwind divorces.</p>



<p>When the court finalized their divorce in January 2003, Lopez was already in what may still be her most famous relationship.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-affleck">Ben Affleck</h2>



<p>Starting in mid-2002, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were in a relationship after forging a connection on the set of <em>Gigli </em>(a 2003 film, though obviously it filmed before it premiered &#8212; in 2001, in fact).</p>



<p>Affleck inspired her album, <em>This is Me &#8230; Then</em>, according to Jennifer Lopez. Their &#8220;Bennifer&#8221; relationship became extremely well-publicized.</p>



<p>In November 2002, the two became engaged. However, they called off their September 2003 wedding at the last minute, citing excessive media attention. In January 2004, they broke off their engagement. It was over.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marc-anthony-was-jennifer-lopez-s-third-husband">Marc Anthony was Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s third husband</h2>



<p>From June of 2004 until June of 2014, Jennifer Lopez was married to singer Marc Anthony. After the harsh lessons of &#8220;Bennifer,&#8221; Lopez was no longer discussing her relationship in interviews.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-casper-smart">Casper Smart</h2>



<p>From October 2011 until August of 2016, Jennifer Lopez had an on-again, off-again relationship with Casper Smart.</p>



<p>Smart was yet another former backup dancer of hers. Apparently, a major issue in their relationship was his alleged infidelity.</p>



<p>Later, Smart would suggest that his immaturity was a factor. Jennifer Lopez was a grown woman with children, while he was 18 years her junior.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alex-rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</h2>



<p>From February 2017 until early 2021, Jennifer Lopez was in a relationship with Alex Rodriguez, a baseball player for a team called the New York Yankees. Early on, he impressed her, particularly with the fact that he was also a parent.</p>



<p>The two became engaged in 2019. As with so many engagements from around that time, they had to postpone their wedding multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez would blame their breakup on lockdown and pandemic delays. However, many have speculated that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/alex-rodriguez-im-not-trying-to-finger-bang-madison-lecroy-okay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Southern Charm</em> star Madison LeCroy&#8217;s claims</a> about him sliding into her DMs may be relevant to the conversation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-affleck-was-jennifer-lopez-s-fourth-marriage">Ben Affleck was Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s fourth marriage</h2>



<p>In April of 2021, astonishing reports claimed that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were dating again. This was a major blast from the past for people who fondly remembered the media circus surrounding their first romance.</p>



<p>By July of that year, Lopez confirmed the rekindled romance. And in April of 2022, Bennifer 2.0 announced their engagement. This time, they didn&#8217;t let anyone stop them, and married on July 16, 2022.</p>



<p>Through 2024, widespread rumors suggested that their breakup was imminent. On August 20, Jennifer Lopez filed to divorce Ben Affleck &#8212; and cited April 2024 as the date of separation. Given that they&#8217;d been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading separate lives</a> for months, that was hardly a shock.</p>
