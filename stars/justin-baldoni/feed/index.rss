<p>Blake Lively is missing the <em>coveted </em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/harvey-weinstein-backs-justin-baldoni-in-blake-lively-legal-war-this-is-just-like-what-happened-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey Weinstein endorsement</a>. And the disgraced producer isn&#8217;t the only one siding against her.</p>



<p>A friend of Justin Baldoni&#8217;s is backing him in his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million legal war</a> against the actress.</p>



<p>Lively&#8217;s legal filings accuse Baldoni of hiring one of his buddies for an already uncomfortable scene in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-movie-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Ends With Us</a></em>.</p>



<p>That man objects to her characterization of the scene and of his own acting credentials. And he&#8217;s willing to go to bad for Baldoni.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adam-mondschein-disagrees-with-blake-lively-s-recollection-of-it-ends-with-us">Adam Mondschein disagrees with Blake Lively&#8217;s recollection of &#8216;It Ends With Us&#8217;</h2>



<p>Actor Adam Mondschein <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/08/celebrity-news/it-ends-with-us-actor-claims-blake-lively-twisted-facts-in-bombshell-lawsuit-against-justin-baldoni/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to</a> <em>Page Six </em>to disparage Blake Lively&#8217;s characterization of the screen time that the two shared in <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>“I’m not going to speculate as to Ms. Lively’s motivations for mentioning me in the complaint,&#8221; he began.</p>



<p>Mondschein continued: &#8220;Needless to say, my experience working with her is very different than the one she described in her lawsuit. Indeed, I was surprised to read her description of the scene.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 9, 2024." class="wp-image-523051" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Blake Lively poses for a photocall during the premiere of the movie &#8220;It ends with us&#8221; in Copenhagen on August 9, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: NILS MEILVANG/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In both her initial complaint and her amended complaint, Lively expressed feeling &#8220;disturbed&#8221; by a number of Baldoni&#8217;s actions, behaviors, and choices.</p>



<p>Among them, she noted, were &#8220;new scenes&#8221; for the film. One of which, she described as a &#8220;violative birthing scene for which he cast a friend as her OBGYN.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively wrote that Baldoni “introduced his ‘best friend’ to play the role of the OBGYN, when ordinarily, a small role of this nature would be filled by a local actor.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mondschein-says-that-he-felt-that-things-were-totally-above-board">Mondschein says that he felt that things were totally above board</h2>



<p>“Ms. Lively felt that the selection of Mr. Baldoni’s friend for this intimate role, in which the actor’s face and hands were in close proximity to her nearly nude genitalia for a birth scene, was invasive and humiliating,” her complaint emphasized.</p>



<p>Mondschein, however, insisted to <em>Page Six</em> that “her costume included a full hospital gown, black shorts, and torso-covering prosthetic to make her appear pregnant in addition to whatever personal garments she chose.”</p>



<p>He alleged that Lively “never complained or expressed discomfort at any point because nothing unusual or improper occurred. It was entirely professional.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="753" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1024x753.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-523052" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-300x221.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-768x565.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-2048x1507.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-960x706.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1080x795.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_03-1200x883.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the 2024 LACMA Art+Film Gala at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 02, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mondschein also clearly bristled at what he felt was the implication that he was not a qualified actor to portray the OBGYN.</p>



<p>“Ms. Lively’s insinuations regarding my qualifications are offensive, as my bonafides are easily searchable online,” he expressed.</p>



<p>Mondschein added: “Lastly, I was, in fact, a local hire (my wife and I are from New York and spend significant time there). As such, I, like any actor accepting that contract, was required to cover my own travel and living expenses in connection with the job.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-s-willing-to-testify-for-team-baldoni-in-2026">He&#8217;s willing to testify for Team Baldoni in 2026</h2>



<p>“If I’m called to testify in the case I will answer truthfully, and more freely, whatever is asked of me with all the legal protection that affords,” Mondschein vowed. </p>



<p>He added: “In particular, by noting that Ms. Lively was not ‘nearly nude’ in the scene we shot together.”</p>



<p>For the record, Lively&#8217;s rep described her as &#8220;nearly nude from below the chest,&#8221; highlighting that her legs were &#8220;spread wide in stirrups and only a small piece of fabric covering her genitalia.&#8221; She allegedly did not receive a closed set for the scene, which fits an alleged pattern in her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal complaint</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1024x669.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-523055" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-768x502.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-2048x1338.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-960x627.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_blakelively_05-1200x784.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>An inside source furnished further details, commenting: “Blake was extremely uncomfortable, and understandably so, when she learned the actor who was placing his face between her legs was the boss’s best friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>That insider continued: &#8220;But apparently Baldoni and company think it was perfectly fine to have his best friend play that role, out of all the actors that could have been chosen.”</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like Lively would have had an issue with Mondschein had he not had this association with Baldoni. Mondschein, however, seems to be taking this very personally.</p>

<p>Justin Baldoni continues his legal war on Blake Lively.</p>



<p>His latest filing labels her husband, Ryan Reynolds, as her &#8220;co-conspirator.&#8221;</p>



<p>Baldoni has gone after Reynolds, essentially accusing him of being mean to him following Baldoni&#8217;s alleged misconduct towards Lively.</p>



<p>Now, he alleges that Reynolds standing by his wife amounts to a defamatory <em>conspiracy</em>, insisting that the lawsuit must go on.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-justin-baldoni-s-lawsuit-is-about-more-than-blake-lively">Justin Baldoni&#8217;s lawsuit is about more than Blake Lively</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-baldoni-calls-ryan-reynolds-blake-livelys-co-conspirator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> reports that in a Thursday, April 3 court filing, Justin Baldoni&#8217;s attorneys are lashing out at Ryan Reynolds&#8217; motion to dismiss.</p>



<p>Reynolds, Baldoni&#8217;s attorneys argue, &#8220;pretends that the Wayfarer Parties’ First Amended Complaint (the ‘FAC’) fails to set forth any basis for his liability and that he merely acted as a supportive spouse. Not so.”</p>



<p>Team Baldoni insists: “The FAC specifically alleges ample facts to support the Wayfarer Parties’ claims against him, based on both his direct actions and his liability as a co-conspirator.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1024x682.jpg" alt="Justin Baldoni on December 9, 2024." class="wp-image-522801" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0404_justinbaldoni_01-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actor/filmmaker and VOS Honoree, Justin Baldoni speaks onstage at the Vital Voices 12th Annual Voices of Solidarity Awards at IAC Building on December 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for  Vital Voices Global Partnership)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, attorneys for Baldoni say that if Reynolds receives his motion to dismiss, he should not be able to recover any attorneys&#8217; fees from their client.</p>



<p>Simply put, it appears that Reynolds&#8217; filing to dismiss the lawsuit against him is poking holes in the lawsuit itself while also noting that Reynolds is allowed to dislike someone (especially while supporting his wife).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Team Baldoni is portraying Reynolds as a &#8220;co-conspirator&#8221; in an alleged defamation conspiracy. The details on this seem pretty vague &#8212; but, perhaps, they will lay out a more comprehensive case in spring of 2026, in court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-team-ryan-reynolds-has-issued-a-response">Now, Team Ryan Reynolds has issued a response</h2>



<p>Speaking to <em>Us Weekly</em>, a spokesperson for Reynolds is not mincing words.</p>



<p>“The main takeaway from the Wayfarer Parties’ opposition to Ryan’s motion to dismiss their case is that they finally realize the plain defects in their complaint,” the statement read. </p>



<p>Team Reynolds continued: “They once again claim defamation without alleging who was defamed, what specifically was said, or how anyone suffered actual harm.”</p>

<p>“Unlike Mr. Baldoni, who built his brand pretending to be a man who is ‘confident enough to listen’ to the women in his life,&#8221; the scathing statement set up.</p>



<p>The statement continued: &#8220;Ryan Reynolds actually is that man and he will continue to support his wife as she stands up to the individuals who not only harassed her but then have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retaliated against her</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the statement notes: &#8220;Under New York law, California law, and indeed in every jurisdiction of the United States this lawsuit not only fails but may result in the Wayfarer Parties covering Ryan’s costs and attorneys’ fees for bringing such a frivolous case in the first place.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-win-or-lose-are-these-lawsuits-the-right-move-for-baldoni">Win or lose, are these lawsuits the right move for Baldoni?</h2>



<p>There have been previous allegations from Baldoni&#8217;s camp about Reynolds and Lively using their A-list influence against the director. </p>



<p>At least some of those have seemingly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been debunked</a>, though it may be up to the court to decide.</p>



<p>It is possible that Baldoni&#8217;s team has evidence and arguments that they have not yet made public. </p>



<p>If so, they could make a solid case and convince the court. It is unclear whether Baldoni will <em>ever</em> be more famous for something other than this bitter legal battle, however.</p>

<p>Blake Lively is filing to dismiss the massive lawsuit that Justin Baldoni filed against her.</p>



<p>Just as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/ryan-reynolds-to-justin-baldoni-you-cant-sue-me-for-being-mean-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Reynolds hit back</a> at Baldoni, his wife is also hoping that the court can nip this $400 million battle in the bud.</p>



<p>However, Lively&#8217;s filing takes a different angle than her husband&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Her legal team argues that because Baldoni is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing her for revenge</a>, the malicious intention makes the lawsuit <em>illegal</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-blake-lively-argue-that-justin-baldoni-s-lawsuit-should-be-dismissed">Why does Blake Lively argue that Justin Baldoni&#8217;s lawsuit should be dismissed?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/20/blake-lively-motion-dismiss-justin-baldoni-defamation-lawsuit-it-ends-with-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>TMZ </em>reports</a> that on Thursday, March 20, Blake Lively filed a motion to dismiss Justin Baldoni&#8217;s lawsuit against her.</p>



<p>She notes that Baldoni&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million lawsuit</a> against her, her husband, and her publicist came <em>after </em>she alleged that he had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexually harassed her</a> during the making of <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>Additionally, Lively&#8217;s filing points to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smear campaign</a> that hounded her for months in late 2024 following her reporting his alleged misconduct to the studio.</p>

<p>How does this make his lawsuit (potentially) illegal?</p>



<p>Blake Lively&#8217;s legal team points out that California law against retaliatory lawsuits bars Justin Baldoni from, well, filing this kind of retaliatory lawsuit.</p>



<p>It will be up to the court to determine whether this law applies to this particular legal struggle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-justin-baldoni-is-only-making-his-case-worse-blake-lively-s-legal-team-argues">Justin Baldoni is only making his case worse, Blake Lively&#8217;s legal team argues</h2>



<p>Blake Lively&#8217;s attorneys say that Justin Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, his company, have &#8220;created more liability for themselves.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the legal filing, they have done so &#8220;by their malicious efforts to sue Ms. Lively &#8216;into oblivion.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively&#8217;s team is asking the court to have Baldoni pay her legal fees alongside substantial financial damages for having filed the suit in the first place.</p>

<p>Within the filing, Blake Lively and her attorneys also hit back at Justin Baldoni&#8217;s narrative that she and Ryan Reynolds are <em>bullying </em>him using their status as Hollywood A-listers.</p>



<p>The document states that Baldoni, who directed <em>It Ends With Us</em> under the auspices of his company producing the film (in which he also starred opposite Lively), is the bully in this scenario.</p>



<p>Why? Because the lawsuit is &#8220;designed to further [Baldoni&#8217;s] sinister campaign to &#8216;bury&#8217; and &#8216;destroy&#8217; Ms. Lively for speaking out about sexual harassment and retaliation.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-court-grand-the-motion-to-dismiss">Will the court grand the motion to dismiss?</h2>



<p>It is unclear whether Blake Lively or Ryan Reynolds&#8217; motions to dismiss against Justin Baldoni will be successful.</p>



<p>The judge will want to take time to review the law itself and case law. </p>



<p>There could also be multiple hearings on the topic, in which both sides will argue whether or not the California law against retaliatory lawsuits applies to this particular retaliatory lawsuit.</p>



<p>It would be nice for many of those involved if this miserable nightmare could come to an end. As things stand, the legal standoff could continue for over a year.</p>

<p>Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint against Justin Baldoni.</p>



<p>This legal update comes as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-lawsuit-darvo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldoni&#8217;s $400 million lawsuit</a> against Lively, her husband, and the New York Times (after the <em>NYT </em>reported on his alleged <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-fires-back-accuses-justin-baldoni-of-inappropriate-touching/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual misconduct</a>) shows no end in sight.</p>



<p>According to Lively&#8217;s attorneys, she was not the only one to voice complaints about Baldoni&#8217;s alleged behavior on the set of <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>The existence of other complaints could fly in the face of Baldoni&#8217;s timeline &#8212; and his claim that Lively fabricated her complaints as part of a creative struggle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-lively-has-filed-an-amended-complaint">Blake Lively has filed an amended complaint</h2>



<p>Putting together a case to file a lawsuit can take time. But even then, sometimes people need to update their court case ahead of trial.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, February 18, Blake Lively filed an amended complaint in New York federal court. The 163-page document adds to her December 31 lawsuit against Justin Baldoni.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://people.com/blake-lively-files-amended-complaint-justin-baldoni-11680275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> reports that, according to her attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, the filing &#8220;provides significant additional evidence and corroboration of her original claims&#8221; and also &#8220;includes previously undisclosed communications&#8221; involving Lively, Sony, Wayfarer Studios and &#8220;numerous other witnesses.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-519604" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; photocall at IET Building: Savoy Place on August 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Sony Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, the attorneys noted that Blake Lively&#8217;s amended complaint &#8220;also added a new claim for defamation.&#8221;</p>



<p>They added that the defamation claim is &#8220;based on the repeated false statements the defendants have made about Ms. Lively since she filed her original complaint, and adds Jed Wallace and his company as defendants.&#8221; </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-hit-with-6-million-defamation-lawsuit-from-justin-baldonis-pr-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallace is suing Lively</a> after she described Baldoni as using his PR firm to run a smear campaign against her. Late last year, many saw screenshots of communications in which he appeared to be doing exactly that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-blake-lively-s-amended-complaint-say">What does Blake Lively&#8217;s amended complaint say?</h2>



<p>One portion of the amended complaint has attorneys for Blake Lively write that Baldoni&#8217;s &#8220;false narrative crumbles under the indisputable truth.&#8221;</p>



<p>The filing notes that Lively &#8220;was not alone in complaining about Mr. Baldoni and raised her concerns contemporaneously as they arose in 2023.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is an important point. Her attorneys continue, saying that she spoke about this in 2023 and &#8220;not in connection with some imagined power play for control of the film in 2024.&#8221; Baldoni&#8217;s argument has been that Lively fabricated allegations of misconduct as part of a creative power struggle, but her team says that this does not match the timeline.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Blake Lively on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-519606" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_04-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the photocall for &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; at the IET London on August 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, a spokesperson for Blake Lively specifies that the amended complaint &#8220;details the corroboration that backs up Blake’s original sexual harassment and retaliation concerns.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to this statement, the filing demonstrates that &#8220;other women confided in Blake about their discomfort and fear of coming forward, and their concern about the current public vitriol.&#8221;</p>



<p>There were indications during the initial press tour for <em>It Ends With Us</em> that some of Blake Lively&#8217;s costars were reluctant to discuss Justin Baldoni in any way. It is possible that some of them will end up testifying in court in a year &#8212; and giving depositions before then.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-519607" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_blakelively_05-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively attend SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-will-not-go-to-trial-until-may-2026">This will not go to trial until May 2026</h2>



<p>This next year or so will likely be full of back-and-forth filings in the courtroom.</p>



<p>The judge has discouraged both parties from saying anything to taint a potential jury pool. That has not stopped Lively and her husband from making a brief <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-snl-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>SNL </em>cameo</a>, or Baldoni from publishing alleged, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-texts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cherrypicked texts</a> to a website that seems dedicated to influencing public opinion.</p>



<p>Public opinion is a fickle thing and easily influenced, especially through disinformation vectors like TikTok. There is no telling what this case will look like in the eye of everyday people (who have not read the legal filings) by the time that it goes to trial.</p>



<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd/app.bsky.feed.post/3lik26akgqk2b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihuoh4zbmlzdmyujvcawkskhhbv65dxe63dj3ytfq2cp2yzf4ahdu"><p lang="en">Justin Baldoni’s billionaire backer threatened to protect Wayfarer “like Israel protected itself from Hamas” if Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds dared to speak up months after It Ends With Us wrapped.

“There were 39,000 dead bodies. There will be two dead bodies when I’m done.”<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd/post/3lik26akgqk2b?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Molly McAleer (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd?ref_src=embed">@molls.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zb42osoewjq6udpi4j4oz4xd/post/3lik26akgqk2b?ref_src=embed">February 19, 2025 at 10:01 AM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>And people who have not read the legal filings are missing some key details. For example, Steve Sarowitz, a partner in Wayfarer Studios, seemingly vowed to &#8220;protect&#8221; the studio with massive retaliation.</p>



<p>According to Lively&#8217;s filing, Sarowitz vowed to a witness to go after Lively and Reynolds if they spoke out against Baldoni. &#8220;I will protect the studio like Israel protected itself from Hamas,&#8221; Sarowitz allegedly threatened, referring to the genocide perpetrated in Gaza. &#8220;There were 39,000 dead bodies. There will be two dead bodies when I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>



<p>If this quoted text is true, it might explain Baldoni&#8217;s massive lawsuit against Lively, Reynolds, and a major newspaper. And, if other allegations are true, this sort of backing could hypothetically explain why an actor and director could feel that he could act however he wishes towards an A-list costar with impunity. </p>

<p>Game. Set. Match, Blake Lively?</p>



<p>While working on film It Ends With Us, Justin Baldoni seemingly sent his co-star a seven-minute voice memo about the movie&#8217;s iconic rooftop scene&#8230; which he said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/">in a January 16 lawsuit</a> that Lively rewrote after he agreed to let her pitch a few changes.</p>



<p>Prior to filing his own lawsuit, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">Baldoni was accused by Lively of sexual harassment</a> on the set of their recent hit movie.</p>



<p>She alleged at the time that Baldoni created a hostile work environment on the movie’s set and later took part in a smear campaign against the Gossip Girl alum.</p>

<p>“Hey Blake, it’s 2 [a.m.] in the morning. Hopefully this does not wake you up. There is so much I want to say to you,” Baldoni begins in this just-released message, which <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/27/justin-baldoni-voice-message-apology-blake-lively/">TMZ obtained</a> in its entirety on Monday, January 27.</p>



<p>The actor, who also directed It Ends With Us, proceeded to pour out his feelings about his and Lively’s big screen adaption, saying, “I want to start with an apology&#8221; and adding:</p>



<p>“Man, reading the second part of your message, my heart sank. I’m really sorry. I for sure fell short and you worked really hard on that. The way you framed it and how it made you feel, I just wanted to say thank you for sharing that with me.”</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know how TMZ obtained this message.</p>



<p>Nor do we know the specific accusations to which Baldoni is responding here.</p>

<p>Baldoni noted he was “very grateful” that Lively felt “safe enough” to tell him her feelings about the project and her experience in Hollywood as a whole.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry. I f—ed up. That is a fail on my part,” Baldoni said. &#8220;One thing you should know about me, I will admit and apologize when I fail. I am far from perfect. I am a very flawed man as my wife will attest.”</p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-fires-back-accuses-justin-baldoni-of-inappropriate-touching/">Lively alleged that Baldoni touched her</a> against her will.</p>



<p>She also said he talked about intercourse with his wife in an odd and open manner, showed her pornographic material and generally kissed and cozied up to her in ways that were NOT in the movie&#8217;s script.</p>

<p>“I’m gonna f— up. I’m gonna say the wrong thing. I’m gonna put my foot in my mouth. I’m gonna say the wrong thing, probably. But I will always apologize and find my way back to center. That is one thing I can assure you of,&#8221; continued Baldoni in this apparent voice memo, which seems to confirm some of Lively&#8217;s allegations against him.</p>



<p>Baldoni then apologized again (&#8220;I’m sorry I made you feel that way. That must have felt terrible.&#8221;) and vowed:</p>



<p>&#8220;I will for sure do better. That was not my best weekend. I should’ve given it more time.”</p>

<p>About two weeks ago, Baldoni sued Lively and others for $400 million, stating for the legal record that she has defamed him and lied about him.</p>



<p>This may still be the case, we suppose.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in his voice memo, though, Baldoni apologized to Lively for &#8220;what you&#8217;ve been through with these other filmmakers,&#8221; calling them &#8220;f&#8211;kheads&#8221; and saying: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just still kind of blown away that this is the industry we&#8217;re in and that you&#8217;ve experienced that as a woman. Hopefully, it&#8217;s not been the experience with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The release of this voice memo coincided on Monday with  a federal judge ruling that Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively could be headed for a trial on March 9, 2026 in response to their legal filing.</p>

<p>Justin Baldoni has fired back at Blake Lively.</p>



<p>In scathing fashion, we should emphasize.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve very likely read about by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">Lively has threatened to sue</a> her It Ends With Us co-star for sexual harassment&#8230; alleging in an explosive legal submission that Baldoni created a hostile work environment on the set of the aforementioned movie.</p>



<p>She also claims that Baldoni and his public relations team took part in a campaign to smear her reputation.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516178" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2189129260-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni speaks at the Vital Voices 12th Annual Voices of Solidarity Awards at IAC Building on December 9, 2024 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for  Vital Voices Global Partnership)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Specifically, the documents in question state that Baldoni caused “severe emotional distress” to Lively as a result of his behavior… included “showing nude videos or images of women to Blake,” along with discussion of Baldoni’s past “pornography addiction” or “sexual conquests.”</p>



<p>Pretty serious stuff, right?</p>



<p>According to Baldoni&#8217;s lawyer, however, also pretty <em>false</em> stuff.</p>

<p>In a statement released on January 7, attorney Bryan Freedman said the following: </p>



<p>&#8220;It is painfully ironic that Blake Lively is accusing Justin Baldoni of weaponizing the media when,&#8221; he asserts, &#8220;her own team orchestrated this vicious attack by sending The New York Times grossly edited documents prior to even filing the complaint.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, Lively sent alleged text messages from Baldoni to this publication as part of its story last month that documented the supposed harassment.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are releasing all of the evidence which will show a pattern of bullying and threats to take over the movie,&#8221; Freedman added on Tuesday, alleging: </p>



<p>&#8220;None of this will come as a surprise because consistent with her past behavior Blake Lively used other people to communicate those threats and bully her way to get whatever she wanted. We have all the receipts and more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lively and Baldoni starred opposite each other in It Ends With Us.</p>



<p>A big screen adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s wildly popular book, the movie has earned $242 million across the globe and was considered a hit at the box office last year.</p>



<p>But all success has now been overshadowed by the allegations back and forth between its pair of leads, as tension became evident almost from the star of the film&#8217;s PR campaign.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for fans to notice, for example, that Baldoni and Lively did not sit for any joint interviews or pose for any red carpet photos together.</p>

<p>Just a day ago, Lively’s legal team told People Magazine that her “serious claims of sexual harassment and retaliation,” first lodged in a California complaint on December 20, 2024, are “backed by concrete facts.”</p>



<p>“This is not a ‘feud’ arising from ‘creative differences’ or a ‘he said/she said’ situation,” her lawyers&#8217; statement read. </p>



<p>“As alleged in Ms. Lively’s complaint, and as we will prove in litigation, Wayfarer [Studios] and its associates engaged in unlawful, retaliatory astroturfing against Ms. Lively for simply trying to protect herself and others on a film set. </p>



<p>&#8220;And their response to the lawsuit has been to launch more attacks against Ms. Lively since her filing.”</p>

<p>The actress&#8217;s initial complaint included accusations that Baldoni and another producer entered her trailer “uninvited” while she was undressed or “vulnerable.&#8221;</p>



<p>It also claimed Baldoni “suddenly” pressured her to “simulate full nudity” in a birth scene and “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed, choreographed or discussed with Ms. Lively, with no intimacy coordinator involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>On December 31, Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against The New York Times over the newspaper&#8217;s December 21 article about Lively&#8217;s complaint, alleging it was the actress &#8220;who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.&#8221;</p>



<p>We really have no idea where this is going, except to say:</p>



<p>We doubt there will be an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-sequel-will-it-happen-in-wake-of-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-feud/">It Ends With Us sequel</a>.</p>

<p>Justin Baldoni’ is once again trying to clear his sullied name.</p>



<p>Last week, the actor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">was sued for sexual harassment</a> by <em>It Ends With Us</em> co-star Blake Lively, who alleged that Baldoni caused “severe emotional distress” to Lively as a result of his toxic behavior on the set of this film.</p>



<p>Such supposed behavior included “showing nude videos or images of women to Blake,” along with discussion of Baldoni’s past “pornography addiction” or “sexual conquests.”</p>



<p>Lively also believes Baldoni engaged in a smear campaign to &#8220;destroy&#8221; her reputation.</p>

<p>In regard to this “social manipulation” campaign, as deemed as such in Lively&#8217;s lawsuit, a lawyer for Baldoni has now issued a new statement.</p>



<p>“TAG PR operated as any other crisis management firm would when hired by a client experiencing threats by two extremely powerful people with unlimited resources,” <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-baldonis-lawyer-texts-in-blake-lively-lawsuit-are-missing-context/">Bryan Freedman told Us Weekly</a>, citing the company that was hired by Baldoni and is one of several firms named in Lively&#8217;s legal papers.</p>



<p>“The standard scenario planning TAG PR drafted proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively’s own actions, interviews, and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that which the media themselves picked up on.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-508059" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM.webp 1360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It seems unlikely Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni will share the screen ever again.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Sony Pictures Releasing / courtesy Everett Collection)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As part of her lawsuit, Lively shared text messages seemingly sent by members of Baldoni&#8217;s public relations team &#8212; all of which hinted at the aforementioned attempt to smear the actress.</p>



<p>In his statement, Freedman claimed these text exchanges between Baldoni and his PR team in the lawsuit were taken out of context, stating:</p>



<p>“It’s ironic that the <em>New York Times</em>, through their effort to ‘uncover’ an insidious PR effort, played directly into the hands of Lively’s own dubious PR tactics by publishing leaked personal text exchanges that lack critical context — the very same tactics she’s accusing the firm of implementing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively&#8217;s lengthy court documents were filed on Friday, December 20.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively poses on the red carpet upon arrival to attend the UK gala screening for &#8220;It ends with us&#8221; at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester square, central London on August 8, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>They were initially published by The New York Times over this past weekend and they refer to “thousands of pages of text messages and emails” that Lively reportedly obtained through a subpoena &#8230; although Freedman now claims they were leaked. </p>



<p>In response to that claim and Freedman’s latest message, a member of Lively’s legal team tells Us Weekly: </p>



<p>“The subpoena disclosed and referenced in the Complaint was served on Jonesworks LLC. The internal documents referred to in the Complaint were produced subject to that subpoena. </p>



<p>&#8220;We expect that further details regarding the subpoena process will be disclosed during discovery.”</p>

<p>One of the alleged texts making headlines across the Internet includes a publicist working with the studio and Baldoni writing to a crisis management expert:</p>



<p>“He wants to feel like she can be buried.”</p>



<p>The paperwork goes on to claim that “this plan went well beyond standard crisis PR,” alleging Baldoni’s team proposed a concept called “‘astroturfing.&#8221;</p>



<p>This has been defined as ‘the practice of publishing opinions or comments on the internet, in the media, etc. that appear to come from ordinary members of the public but actually come from a particular company or political group.’”</p>

<p>Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively co-starred in the film It Ends With Us.</p>



<p>But when it comes to the ugly and unfortunate feud between these former colleagues?</p>



<p>Well. That is just beginning.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-508059" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM.webp 1360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It seems unlikely Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni will share the screen ever again.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Sony Pictures Releasing / courtesy Everett Collection)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">Lively filed a sexual harassment lawsuit</a> last week against Baldoni.</p>



<p>In these legal papers, Lively accuses Baldoni of launching a smear campaign to “destroy” her reputation, while also claiming Baldoni created a hostile work environment on the set of the aforementioned book adaption.</p>



<p>Specifically, the documents allege that the actor caused “severe emotional distress” to Lively as a result of his behavior… which included “showing nude videos or images of women to Blake,” along with discussion of Baldoni’s past “pornography addiction” or “sexual conquests.”</p>



<p>In a meeting that involved Lively, husband Ryan Reynolds, Baldoni and others involved in the project, Baldoni was asked to make “no further mentions of cast and crew’s genitalia, no more inquiries about Blake’s weight, and no further mention of Blake’s dead father.”</p>



<p>We had previously heard that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-drama/">Baldoni fat-shamed Lively</a> on set, as shooting on the movie got underway not long after she gave birth.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively poses on the red carpet upon arrival to attend the UK gala screening for &#8220;It ends with us&#8221; at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester square, central London on August 8, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to The New York Times, meanwhile, Baldoni&#8217;s lawyer Bryan Freedman has now fired back against Lively troubling allegations.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives,&#8221; Freedman said in a statement, referring to the production company the director cofounded.</p>



<p>Baldoni&#8217;s attorney called Lively&#8217;s allegations in the complaint &#8220;yet another desperate attempt to &#8216;fix&#8217; her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lively and Baldoni did not promote It Ends With Us together in any way &#8212; no interviews, no photo shoots &#8212; promoting massive speculation this summer over what had transpired between them.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508061" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165600162-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 6, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Baldoni continued, through his legal team:</p>



<p>&#8220;These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.&#8221;</p>



<p>The attorney said Wayfarer Studios &#8220;made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film&#8221; due to alleged &#8220;multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.&#8221;</p>



<p>It sure sounds like Baldoni and Lively won&#8217;t be starring in an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-sequel-will-it-happen-in-wake-of-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-feud/">It Ends With Us sequel</a>, huh?</p>

<p>In her own statement to The New York Times, Lively said the following: </p>



<p>&#8220;I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got a feeling we&#8217;ll be hearing a lot more about this in the coming days, weeks and months.</p>

<p>Blake Lively had taken what must be unprecedented action against her recent co-star, Justin Baldoni.</p>



<p>Following months of speculation regarding a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-drama/">feud between the actor and the actress</a> &#8212; who played the lead roles this year in the film It Ends With Us &#8212; Lively filed a lawsuit this week against Baldoni for sexual harassment.</p>



<p>According to documents obtained by TMZ, Lively alleges that Baldoni he created a hostile work environment on the set of the aforementioned book adaption &#8212; and later took part in a campaign against his colleaguel</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2165362039-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively poses on the red carpet upon arrival to attend the UK gala screening for &#8220;It ends with us&#8221; at the Odeon Luxe in Leicester square, central London on August 8, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Specifically, the documents claim that Baldoni caused &#8220;severe emotional distress&#8221; to Lively as a result of his behavior&#8230; included &#8220;showing nude videos or images of women to Blake,&#8221; along with discussion of Baldoni&#8217;s past &#8220;pornography addiction&#8221; or &#8220;sexual conquests.&#8221;</p>



<p>At one point, the lawsuit states, Lively&#8217;s husband, Ryan Reynolds, even attended a meeting among those involved with the movie to address these topics.</p>



<p>Other topics, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/21/blake-lively-sues-justin-baldoni-sexual-harassment-retaliation-on-it-ends-with-us-set/">per TMZ</a>, included &#8220;no further mentions of cast and crew&#8217;s genitalia, no more inquiries about Blake&#8217;s weight, and no further mention of Blake&#8217;s dead father.&#8221; </p>



<p>(Lively&#8217;s dad passed away in 2021.)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-508059" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM.webp 1360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It seems unlikely Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni will share the screen ever again.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Sony Pictures Releasing / courtesy Everett Collection)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Referring to the lawsuit, TMZ reported that the meeting cited above also emphasized that there be “no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex or on camera climaxing by BL outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project.”</p>



<p>As previously outlined, there was alleged disagreement over the final cut of It Ends With Us (on which Lively served as a producer), along with disputes over just how the movie would be marketed.</p>



<p>Lively asserts Baldoni and others in his camp then engaged in a &#8220;social manipulation&#8221; campaign to &#8220;destroy&#8221; Lively&#8217;s reputation. </p>



<p>The lawsuit even includes text messages from Baldoni&#8217;s publicist to the studio publicist that say Baldoni &#8220;wants to feel like [Ms. Lively] can be buried, and &#8220;We can&#8217;t write we will destroy her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baldoni and Lively never appeared on the red carpet together during the promotion for It Ends With Us and never sat down for any joint interviews.</p>



<p>Baldoni&#8217;s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, has fired back at Lively&#8217;s lawsuit, claiming it&#8217;s an attempt to &#8220;fix her negative reputation&#8221; and noting it&#8217;s &#8220;false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prior to the film’s release, Baldoni told Variety &#8212; when asked about It Starts With Us, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jana-kramer-blake-lively-it-ends-with-us-dv/">a potential sequel</a> to the movie based on a book by that same title &#8212; that he and production studio haven’t “even begun to think that far ahead. I’m trying to stay in the present as much as I can.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re just gonna go ahead now, however, and make the following not-so-bold prediction:</p>



<p>If a sequel <em>does</em> move forward, it will <em>not</em> star Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.</p>

<p>As you may have heard, It Ends With Us is a hit movie &#8212; with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-movie-ending-explained/">a controversial ending</a>.</p>



<p>As you <em>also</em> may have heard, star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-drama/">Blake Lively did not get along</a> with co-star Justin Baldoni (who also directed this film) and has mostly avoided him during the movie&#8217;s recent promotional tour.</p>



<p>But what we&#8217;re just hearing now for the first time?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-1024x683.jpg" alt="Justin Baldoni photograph" class="wp-image-507067" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1853525717-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends &#8220;The Boys In The Boat&#8221; New York Screening at Museum of Modern Art on December 13, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>No one involved with It Ends With Us is speaking to Baldoni!</p>



<p>&#8220;All is not what it seems,&#8221; a set source <a href="https://people.com/it-ends-with-us-director-justin-baldoni-blake-lively-cast-clash-conflict-8694328">tells People Magazine</a>. &#8220;There is much more to this story. The principal cast and [author] Colleen Hoover will have nothing to do with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier this week, The Hollywood Reporter claimed that Lively (who served as a producer on the movie) and Baldoni clashed over the final cut of the blockbuster.</p>



<p>Other sources have said that Lively felt &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; around Baldoni while filming.</p>



<p>Then there was The Daily Mail, which published a report alleging Baldoni was &#8220;chauvinistic&#8221; and &#8220;borderline abusive&#8221; on the set of It Ends with Us.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know if any of these allegations are true, but it has been noticeable that Lively and Baldoni didn&#8217;t pose together at this month&#8217;s New York City premiere of It Ends With Us.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-683x1024.jpg" alt="Justin Baldoni at a premiere" class="wp-image-507071" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165611730-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 6, 2024 in New York City.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Along with Lively, the film features Jenny Slate, Brandon Sklenar, Hasan Minhaj, Isabela Ferrer, Alex Neustaedter and others.</p>



<p>None of these cast members spoke to People for its most recent feature; their reps denied requests for comment by the publication.</p>



<p>Amid this flurry of speculation, though, none of these cast members has come out and spoken out in defense of Baldoni, either.</p>



<p>Nor have they sat down for any interviews alongside him with any members of the media to hype the movie up in any way.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-507073" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153735026-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends the Columbia Pictures World Premiere of &#8220;The Garfield Movie&#8221; at TCL Chinese Theatre on May 19, 2024 in Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking ahead, meanwhile, Hoover wrote a sequel/prequel to her best-selling novel titled It Starts With Us.</p>



<p>An insider close to Baldoni attributed the ongoing discord to &#8220;creative differences&#8221; that had been &#8220;overblown&#8221; to People on Monday, claiming Lively &#8220;wants to direct the next movie, sidelining him and securing the rights from Colleen.&#8221;</p>



<p>And Baldoni, for his part, has not added any fuel to this fascinating and mysterious fire.</p>



<p>In fact, when asked if he will direct the follow-up a couple weeks ago, Baldoni replied:</p>



<p>“I think there are better people for that one. I think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That’s what I think.”</p>
