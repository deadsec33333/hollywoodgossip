										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last week, the court <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/danny-masterson-sentenced-30-years-on-rape-charges-wife-bijou-philips-reportedly-breaks-down-in-court/">sentenced convicted rapist Danny Masterson to 30 years</a> in prison.</p>



<p>The two survivors for whom he received the convictions and sentencing were not his only accusers. They are just the only ones whose charges could bring him to justice &#8212; so far.</p>



<p>In a clownish and inexcusable move, Masterson&#8217;s former castmates Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis wrote on his behalf. Fortunately, their misguided pleas for leniency succeeded only in pissing off a lot of people.</p>



<p>Now, one of Masterson&#8217;s accusers is pointing out that Kutcher&#8217;s history looks a little creepy, too.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis spoke on behalf of Ukraine soon after Russia launched its invasion in early 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Chrissie Bixler is only one of several women to publicly come forward with a horror story about Danny Masterson.</p>



<p>In the wake of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis&#8217; clownish advocacy for their scumbag <em>That &#8217;70s Show</em> castmate, she decided to call them out.</p>



<p>She was far from alone. But she singled out Kutcher, including a number of callbacks to some creepy jokes and other unsettling moments.</p>

<p>Back when Hilary Duff was a teenage minor, Kutcher did an episode of Punk&#8217;d that featured her. </p>



<p>He joked at the time that she was one of the young actresses that &#8220;we&#8217;re all waiting for to turn 18.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other clips covered how Kutcher and Kunis first met on <em>That &#8217;70s Show</em> and shared their first kiss on set. Famously, Mila joined the cast when she was only 14. (And, grossly, there&#8217;s a clip of Masterson telling Mila that she was <em>hotter </em>at that age)</p>

<p>We can acknowledge that a <em>lot </em>of people made effed up jokes that have not aged well. Part of life is about growing and learning.</p>



<p>Societal norms about humor shift, usually in positive direction. Over time, people realize that ostensibly harmless jokes can help to normalize things that are harmful or even straight-up evil.</p>



<p>You know, there was a whole brand of Nazi-related humor that was popular on the internet for a while. You know what killed it? A very public resurgence of very real Nazis. Fascism jokes are less funny if a <em>fascist </em>laughs.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="753" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-1024x753.jpg" alt="Ashton and Mila Kiss" class="wp-image-230340" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-300x221.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-768x565.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-735x541.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-335x246.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-347x255.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-520x383.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-640x471.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-960x706.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss-1080x795.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/ashton-and-mila-kiss.jpg 1468w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis attend Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers at ORACLE Arena on June 5, 2016 in Oakland, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, the same is largely true about jokes about counting down the days until a teenager turns 18.</p>



<p>It sounds like a joke. Only the creepiest weirdos would ask out someone on their 18th birthday because it was illegal the day before. Or literally count down to their birthdays with the intention of pursuing them.</p>



<p>But a lot of people have a better understanding of just how many creepy weirdos there are out there.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="707" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-707x1024.jpg" alt="Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher: Go Dodgers!" class="wp-image-248829" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-707x1024.jpg 707w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-768x1113.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-1060x1536.jpg 1060w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-1413x2048.jpg 1413w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-735x1065.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-231x335.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-239x347.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-359x520.jpg 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-442x640.jpg 442w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-530x768.jpg 530w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-662x960.jpg 662w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-745x1080.jpg 745w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-go-dodgers-scaled.jpg 1766w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are pretty big Dodgers fans. That should be evident by this photograph.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said &#8230; you know what&#8217;s usually a good indicator that someone has grown out of a garbage pattern of behavior, like predatory jokes?</p>



<p>If they show signs that they&#8217;ve changed.</p>



<p>The biggest step to that is no longer telling jokes that might make an actual predator laugh, or normalize their behavior. The second biggest is just showing how opposed you are to actual bad guys. Writing a letter to defend a convicted rapist? That&#8217;s not that.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">We were introduced to Kutcher and his lovable, dim-witted personality as Michael Kelso on this Fox hit.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (FOX)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the bit about the age gap &#8230; 5 years is an inconsequential age gap at almost any point.</p>



<p>That said, when Ashton and Mila first met, she was only 14. She<em> misled </em>casting directors about her age in order to get the role. He was 19.</p>



<p>But they were both teenagers, which could be worse. And they didn&#8217;t actually start dating until 2012 &#8212; years and years after the series ended.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mila Kunis got her big break as Jackie Burkhart on That 70s Show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (FOX)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t think that anyone circulating these clips that Bixler pointed out believes that Kutcher is a predator like Masterson. Not really.</p>



<p>Mostly, people are just calling out moments of his that haven&#8217;t aged well. Why? Because both of these actors burned a lot of social capitol when they wrote to defend a convicted rapist. </p>



<p>This was not a case of two people doing a good thing, because defending a monster is bad. We should all just be happy that their efforts were in vain. People will be bringing up this blunder for years to come, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Folks, get ready for a return trip to Eric Forman&#8217;s basement!</p>
<p>Except this time, instead of joining the rotation, Topher Grace will be interruping the session with dad jokes and questions about that weird smell.</p>
<p>Allow us to explain:</p>
<p>Netflix revealed this week that most of the cast of <em>That &#8217;70s Show</em> has signed on to star in spinoff about the Clinton years titled &#8212; you guessed it! &#8212; <em>That &#8217;90s Show</em>!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Wilmer Valderrama, Laura Prepon, and the aforementioned Topher Grace are among those who will be once again taking up residence in Point Place, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>This time around, Eric and company will be playing parents to a generation of teens growing up in the era of Tupac and Kurt Cobain.</p>
<p>The story will center around Eric and Donna&#8217;s daughter, Leia.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But instead of haaaaangin&#8217; out down the street, she&#8217;ll be traveling to her mom and dads&#8217; home state of Wisconsin to spend the summer with Eric&#8217;s parents, who will once again be played by&nbsp;Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on if &quot;the Circle&quot; and other irreverent elements from <em>That &#8217;70s Show </em>will be featured in the spinoff.</p>
<p>But considering the show&#8217;s tagline &#8212; &ldquo;sex, drugs and rock &rsquo;n roll never dies, it just changes clothes&quot; &#8212; we think the &#8217;90s version will continue to push the envelope.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The 10-episode series &#8212; which also stars Ashley Aufderheide, Mace Coronel, Maxwell Acee Donovan, Reyn Doi and Sam Morelos &#8212; doesn&#8217;t have a release date yet, but the excitement from fans is at a fever pitch following news that most of the cast will be reprising their roles.</p>
<p>Grace confirmed his involvement over the weekend with a photo of himself rocking a tattered Point Place Vikings class of &lsquo;77 T-shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, still fits. #hellowisconsin,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Noticeably absent from the cast is Danny Masterson, who played Hyde on <em>That &#8217;70s Show.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2020/06/danny-masterson-arrested-on-rape-charges-that-70s-show-star-face/">Masterson was arrested on rape charges</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>Following several unsuccessful attempts to have the charges dismissed, the actor is set to stand trial in August of this year.</p>

<p><a href="/2017/12/danny-masterson-fired-by-netflix-amidst-rape-allegations/">Masterson has already been let go from one Netflix show</a>, having been fired from <em>The Ranch </em>at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast managed to beat the odds, successfully navigating the transition from child stardom to successful careers as grownups.</p>
<p><a href="/2014/12/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-married/">Kutcher and Kunis got married</a> in 2014 and have since welcomed two children together.</p>

<p>Grace currently stars on the ABC sitcom <em>Home Economics</em>; Prepon was one of the stars of the acclaimed prison dramedy <em>Orange Is the New Blac</em>k, and Valderrama is a regular on the long-running CBS series <em>NCIS</em>.</p>
<p>Sitcom sequels, reboots, and spinoffs are a dime a dozen these days, but it&#8217;s rare for the cast and creators of a show as popular and beloved as <em>That &#8217;70s Show</em> to reassemble so long after going their separate ways.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re sure fans who grew up with the show&#8217;s stars are eager to annoy their kids by pointing out era-specific references, just like their parents did with them!&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Volodymyr Zelensky is an extremely busy man these days.</p>
<p>The President of Ukraine,&nbsp;Zelensky has remained in his country&#8217;s capital of Kyiv amid an unprompted and unwarranted invasion by Russia, holding press conference, speaking to fellow world leaders and doing all he can to remain strong in the face of a violent attack against democracy.</p>
<p>And yet:</p>
<p>Zelensky found time this week to connect with a pair of Hollywood superstars.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As you may have previously heard about,&nbsp;Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher took advantage of their global platform this month to help raise funds for the actress&#8217; native country.</p>
<p>In a truly incredible and inspiring example of using one&#8217;s celebrity for good, Kunis and Kutcher didn&#8217;t just raise minimal funds for show or anything, either.</p>
<p>THEY RAISED $35 MILLION.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Over 65,000 of you donated,&quot; said Kunis on Monday in response to the outpouring of money. &quot;We are overwhelmed with gratitude for the support.&quot;</p>
<p>She pointed out that while the donations will not solve the crisis, &quot;our collective effort will provide a softer landing for so many people as they forge ahead into their future of uncertainty.&quot;</p>
<p>Added Kutcher:</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to do everything we can to ensure that the outpouring of love that came from you all as a part of this campaign finds the maximum impact with those in need.</p>
<p>&quot;As funding continues to come in, we are going to treat every dollar as if it is being donated out of our pocket.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The spouses previously vowed to match all donations to the fundraiser up to $3 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, meanwhile, in response to all Kunis and Kutcher have done for his ravaged nation,&nbsp;Zelensky actually hopped on a Zoom call with the couple.</p>
<p>&quot;I thank them on behalf of our people &#8230; on behalf all us,&quot; the worldwide hero said.</p>
<p>Zelensky called the actor and the actress a star tandem &quot;who believe in us in our victory in our future&quot;.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Ukrainian President also posted a photo on Twitter of his video chat with the pair on social media, thanking them in the process for being among the first to respond to the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Grateful for their support. Impressed by their determination. They inspire the world. #StandWithUkraine,&rdquo; Zelensky wrote.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Migration says that since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in late February, over three million refugees have fled the country, including at least 1.5 million children.</p>
<p>Kunis herself is a &quot;proud Ukrainian,&quot; she wrote in her initial GoFundMe-based video, explaining that she was born in Chernivtsi, a city in southwestern Ukraine, in 1983 and her family traveled to America eight years later.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Ukrainians are proud and brave people who deserve our help in their time of need,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This unjust attack on Ukraine and humanity at large is devastating and the Ukrainian people need our support.&quot;</p>
<p>Donations to the GoFundMe are going to two organizations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Freight transportation company Flexport, which is organizing shipments of relief supplies to refugee sites in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova.</li>
	<li>
		Airbnb, which is providing free, short-term housing to refugees from Ukraine.</li>
</ol>
<p>We salute Kunis, Kutcher and all other celebrities who have dedicated their time and resources to this cause.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On February 24, Russian forces launched a massive invasion of Ukraine, turning a thriving democracy into a war zone.</p>
<p>Since then, celebrity athletes and <a href="/slideshows/90-day-fiance-stars-speak-out-as-russia-invades-ukraine/">reality stars have spoken up for Ukraine</a>, many highlighting their ties to the nation.</p>
<p>Mila Kunis is a beloved American actress, but she was born in Ukraine.</p>
<p>She and husband Ashton Kutcher are using their platform and their voices to raise millions for those fleeing a country under siege.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher shared a short video, because they know that your time is valuable.</p>
<p>They posted the fundraising video to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBq7YjRt1Lg&amp;t=2s">YouTube</a>, and we have included it here for your convenience.</p>
<p>Mila reminds everyone that she spent the better part of the first decade of her life in Ukraine.</p>

<p>She and her family came to the United States when she was a child.</p>
<p>They were refugees amidst the fall of communism and the collapse of the USSR.</p>
<p>Though Mila is proud to be an American, she also has a great deal of pride in the land of her birth &#8212; and is <em>heartbroken </em>by this war.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Mila is doing more than just using her voice and personal connection to share her feelings.</p>
<p>She and Ashton Kutcher have partnered with Airbnb and with FlexPort.org to offer something more tangible.</p>
<p>They are aiming to provide relief options for refugees fleeing the devastation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-682x1024.jpg" alt="Mila Kunis at Bad Moms Premiere" class="wp-image-245992" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/mila-kunis-at-bad-moms-premiere-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Their goal is to raise $30 million.</p>
<p>The couple has vowed to match up to $3 million raised through a particular GoFundMe account.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Ukraine are strong and brave but being strong and brave doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not worthy of support,&quot; Mila affirmed.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We need to support the people of Ukraine. Please help us,&quot; Mila implored.</p>
<p>It only took a matter of hours for the fundraiser to bring in $2.5 million.</p>
<p>By Friday afternoon, the donations had nearly reached $9 million and continued to rise, as seen on <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-ukraine?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=bcgfm_tw_fund_stand-with-ukraine">the GoFundMe page</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As is almost always the case with wars, this horror has also created a refugee crisis.</p>
<p>More than a million Ukrainians fled their country in less than a week.</p>
<p>Some feared being killed or injured by the invading army. Others fear living in a conquered Ukraine under Vladimir Putin&#8217;s rule.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Overall, much of the world fears to respond with direct military action, for fear of Russia&#8217;s nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>Without NATO membership or a similar mutual defense agreement with other world powers, Ukraine has had to fight largely on its own.</p>
<p>Anti-tank weapons, donations, and relief supplies have poured in from across the globe, but the U.S. and the E.U. are both reluctant to potentially launch World War III.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The best ending for this would simply be for the sanctions and global condemnation to force those closest to Vladimir Putin to take action and remove him from office.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that seems to be a fantasy for the moment.</p>
<p>One very real thing that world powers can do is to open their borders to refugees from Ukraine, including those who had to flee without visas or passports.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It is difficult to anticipate that you will need travel documentation when an unprovoked war springs up practically overnight.</p>
<p>It is even harder to fish through the rubble of what was once your home to retrieve identifying documents.</p>
<p>This is why some countries, notably Ireland, have waived standard paperwork requirements to embrace refugees.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>More countries should do the same. Ukraine has a population of tens of millions; many more will need to flee before this horror ends.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what Mila and Ashton are doing here is a worthy cause: helping to provide emergency relief to refugees who do make it to safety.</p>
<p>Escaping a war zone is only part of the journey to safety. Everyone needs shelter, food, and clothing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Based on the direction of their careers and their outward appearances, it likely comes as a shock to many readers that Mila Kunis and&nbsp;Macaulay Culkin were once a romantic item.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t mean to be rude here, just factual.</p>

<p>Here is a recent photo of Kunis:</p>

<p>And here is a recent photo of Culkin:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But it&#8217;s true:</p>
<p>Not only did Kunis and Culkin date&#8230; they dated for almost eight years between 2002 and 2010!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not even the craziest part of their story, however.</p>
<p>Are you ready to react like Culkin splashing aftershave all over his face for the first time as a young boy? Okay, here we go&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; Culkin is actually the one who dumped Kunis!</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s very safe to assume, at least, based on an interview Kunis just gave on Dax Shepard&#8217;s Armchair Expert podcast.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a horrible breakup. I had a horrible, horrible, horrible breakup,&quot; she said about Culkin, adding in more vague detail:</p>
<p>&quot;I f-cked up. I was an asshole in my 20s and I&#8217;ll be the first to admit it.</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#8217;s kinda something that took me a long time to come out and be like, &#8216;Yeah, you know what, I was a dick,&#8217; and accept it and I own it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Ummm&#8230; what the heck did you do, Mila?</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s f-cked up what I did. It&#8217;s f-cked up what I did, and it&#8217;s f-cked up how I did it,&quot; the actress continued, sadly leaving us to wonder what the giant mistake actually could have been.</p>
<p>It had to have been that she cheated, right?</p>
<p>And maybe that she cheated with someone very close to Culkin?</p>
<p>In the couple&#8217;s bedroom or something?</p>
<p>Sorry, but our minds are racing over here at the possibilities.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been however many years now, I think everybody&#8217;s in a much better place,&quot; Kunis eventually said, prior to pivoting to her marriage to Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The couple is one of the more stable and private in Hollywood, parents to a pair of kids (Wyatt and Dimitri) who we don&#8217;t see very much of.</p>
<p>Before getting with Kutcher, though, it sounds like maybe Mila got with&#8230; a lot of other men?</p>
<p>&quot;When I got to be single I said, I just need to figure myself out. I genuinely need to know why I did what I did and, like, regroup myself as a human,&quot; she said, continuing:</p>
<p>&quot;So I just did that and, subsequently, after 6pm was open for business.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure what she means by that phrase. But we can sort of guess.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#8217;t want to date, I didn&#8217;t want to be taken out to the movies,&quot; Mila said, again making us think she just hooked up with guys during this phase and then went home.</p>
<p>Which is totally understandable.</p>
<p>Finally, though, she cozied up to Kutcher, who she had known since their time as co-stars on That 70s Show.</p>
<p>After sleeping with him, the star says&nbsp; she &quot;spent the night at somebody&#8217;s house&quot; for the first time in two years.</p>
<p>And Kunis ends this tale on a funny note, explaining on the podcast&nbsp;that her mon reactes as follows when she said she was actually dating Kutcher:</p>
<p>&quot;She literally was like, &#8216;Shut the f-ck up&#8217; in Russian.&quot;</p>

<p>Typically, any time the actor&#8217;s famous wife gets brought up, it&#8217;s because Kutcher is gushing endlessly over the gorgeous star.</p>
<p>Last week, however, Kutcher was forced to respond to rumors that he&#8217;s been cheating on Kunis, all of which started because Star Magazine went out and&#8230; well&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; acted like Star Magazine.</p>
<p>The trashy tabloid published a story in its latest issue that featured a photo of Kutcher and a mystery woman getting out of a car and preparing to board a private airplane.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hey, Ashton</em></strong>, editors at Star asked. <strong><em>Who&#8217;s the girl?</em></strong></p>
<p>This, of course, is Supermarket Tabloid 101. You don&#8217;t directly accuse a celebrity of infidelity&#8230; you just run random photos and pose vague questions and get the public wondering about what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So, Ashton, what was going on in this picture? HUH?!?!?!?!?</p>
<p>The actor was apparently hanging out with a relative, that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>&quot;You should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin,&rdquo; Kutcher wrote last night, adding with sarcasm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry aunt Jodie these magazines lack integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sure Star is very sorry about this implication and will never make the same mistake with Kutcher or any other celebrity ever again.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time the That &rsquo;70s Show and Two and a Half Men alum has defended himself against false infidelity chatter.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the Robert D. Ray Pillar of Character Award in April, <a href="/2017/04/ashton-kutcher-im-awesome-because-of-mila-kunis/">Kutcher&nbsp;acknowledged</a> his alleged past deeds, such as supposedly cheating on Demi Moore prior to their 2013 divorce, for his strong character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably the first person to get this award for character who had, like, his name splashed across every gossip magazine as an adulterer like five years ago,&rdquo; Kutcher said, alluding the <a href="/2011/10/sara-leal-speaks-on-good-unproteced-sex-with-ashton-kutcher/">supposedly good/unprotected sex he had with a 22-year old</a> back in the day.</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>&quot;Character comes when those magazines tear you apart for something you may or may not have done and you gotta go out and perform tomorrow &#8211; with everyone looking at you like you might be an adulterer.&quot;</p>

<p>Kutcher and Moore got married in 2005 and split six years later. They did not have any children together.</p>
<p>He later married Kunis in 2015. The couple shares two children, daughter Wyatt, 2, and 7-month-old son Dimitri and remains one of our favorite twosomes in Hollywood.</p>
