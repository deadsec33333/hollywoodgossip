										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Jacob Roloff is in a reflective mood.</p>



<p>The former Little People, Big World cast member walked away from this TLC reality show a decade ago &#8212; later admitting that he did so because he had allegedly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/jacob-roloff-accuses-little-people-big-world-producer-of-molesta/">been molested by a producer</a>.</p>



<p>“This spring marks 10 years since I got my money from the show I was on for over 10 years of my life. I was 18 and finally had the agency to not sign the contract, so I didn’t, and promptly left home mostly due to disgust for the show and reality TV in general,” Roloff wrote over this past weekend alongside a carousel of photos on Instagram.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="752" height="529" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/jacob-izzy.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-522535" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/jacob-izzy.webp 752w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/jacob-izzy-300x211.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jacob Roloff and his wife smile here for the camera.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 28-year old added that he “used the money” to “build a world” with his wife, Isabel Rock. </p>



<p>The spouses welcomed their son, Mateo, in December 2021 &#8212; and the former reality star said he was “grateful” that this toddler has been able to grow up “doing the same things” he did as a child.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no pressure of the camera.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no concern over what life in the spotlight will do to Mateo.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="529" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/Isabel-Jacob-Roloff-Sex.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-522538" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/Isabel-Jacob-Roloff-Sex.webp 940w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/Isabel-Jacob-Roloff-Sex-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/Isabel-Jacob-Roloff-Sex-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/Isabel-Jacob-Roloff-Sex-728x410.webp 728w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Certainly it has been insightful these last 4 years in a lot of ways, both materially &#8212; learning equipment operation, my own growing style, the systems for farming, etc—and retrospectively — ‘what is the farm, without a tv crew?’, ‘what can the farm be, without TV?’” Jacob continued.</p>



<p>Indeed, despite leaving Little People, Big World behind&#8230; Jacob hasn&#8217;t been leaving his family behind.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s spending more and more time these days <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/little-people-big-news-jacob-roloff-to-move-on-to-fathers-farm/">on his dad&#8217;s property</a>.</p>



<p>The semi-new father revealed that pumpkin season was still “huge” for Roloff Farms and expressed his appreciation for the loyal customers that continue to stop year after year. </p>



<p>However, Jacob ultimately wanted to “encourage a more localized community space instead of so heavily relying on out of town tourism” and create “an intermittent space for community gathering, creating useful things and being a useful space.”</p>



<p>This is someone who has always thought big picture.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="474" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-1024x474.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522541" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-1024x474.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-300x139.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-768x355.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-960x444.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-1080x500.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5-1200x555.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/186de6a476618e53ce7a384097c31ec5.jpg 1241w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It&#8217;s a throwback! This is a photo of Jacob Roloff on Little People, Big World.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Roloff concluded this latest message by adding: </p>



<p>“I am grateful for the opportunity to be where I am to steward this land the best I can. Always learning and growing. I can only hope we have this farm for another generation.”</p>



<p>Jacob has long been critical of reality television and its impact.</p>



<p>&#8220;People don’t realize I was paid roughly $6/hr to be filmed for my whole childhood,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/jacob-roloff-reveals-paltry-reality-show-salary-says-tv-sucks-yo/">Jacob wrote online</a> about three years ago, emphasizing the misperception that follows him around in terms of his bank account.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m still called rich derisively lol&#8230; I wish I went scorched earth but I value family. I wish I kept filming but I value my principles and my soul. Life is complicated.&#8221;</p>



<p>In December 2020, Roloff stunned observers when he accused a TLC producer of molesting him.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is often much easier to think about things than it is to talk about them, and so this disclosure has been delayed, but through that delay I have found the fortitude and words,&#8221; he wrote back then.</p>



<p>He continued, naming his alleged perpetrator as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;As a child, after what I realize now was a long grooming process, I was molested by an executive field producer for Little People, Big World, Chris Cardamone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not expect to provide details of this encounter at any point publicly. I do hope he is never allowed around children again.</p>



<p>&#8220;I choose to disclose it now as it remains a traumatic memory that needs to be exorcised of any further power over my development.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jacob Roloff would like everyone to know two things about his mother.</p>



<p>First, Amy Roloff is alive.</p>



<p>Second, Amy Roloff is a very good baker.</p>



<p>The second is likely known already to most<em> Little People, Big World</em> fans&#8230; while Jacob felt the need to pass along the first fact after reading a certain rumor spreading across the Internet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wtf lol there&#8217;s a death hoax about my mom going around on TikTok,&#8221; Jacob tweeted in July 2023, adding as an important clarification:</p>



<p>&#8220;Godspeed to the new generation [salute emoji] she just gave me some blueberry muffins very tasty.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, you need to look pretty closely around social media for it, but there <em>is</em> speculation out there that Amy suffered a stroke.</p>



<p>Hence the relief many folks expressed to Jacob in the wake of his assurance.</p>



<p>&#8220;I did hear about this!&#8221; one individual wrote, for example. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;My mom sent me an article from some random gossip website I never heard of. It said she had a stroke which was not true at all. She’s 100% fine and was at the LP conference with Tori and Zach at the time.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/amy-roloff-shares-rare-photo-with-all-4-children-my-greatest-gifts/">Amy hung out with all four of her kids</a> in May and continues to sit down for Instagram Live sessions.</p>



<p>She conducted an especially revealing one two months ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/amy-roloff-reveals-pregnancy-struggles-slams-ex-husband-as-absentee-dad/">delving into past fears of infertility</a> back when she was married to Matt Roloff.</p>



<p>The mother of four eventually underwent fertility treatment that made it more likely she might have multiple children at once — which understandably freaked her out.</p>



<p>“Being a little person, I knew I would be able to carry one baby but could I carry two? Could I carry three?” she asked aloud during this Instagram session.</p>

<p>After Roloff delivered her twin boys via C-section, she told followers that she felt alone, explaining that she and Matt had just moved to Oregon and she was “by herself.”</p>



<p>This is where Amy hurled a bit of shade in her ex-husband&#8217;s direction.</p>



<p>The TLC personality confessed that “Matt had to go to work” and handing two newborns was “a lot to take on.”</p>



<p>At this point, however, Amy and Matt are on very amicable terms.</p>



<p>They split in 2016, but continue to share the screen on episodes of Little People, Big World.</p>

<p>And now about her marriage.</p>



<p>Taking part in a Q&amp;A with fans on Instagram this week, Isabel admitted that her relationship has been far from perfect.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jacob and I have been married for almost five years this September,&#8221; Roloff told fans. &#8220;Marriage was not something I pictured for myself as a little girl. I just had my sights set on other things.&#8221;</p>



<p>Isabel and Jacob are parents to a three-year old son named Mateo.</p>

<p>Isabel went on to say that her parents didn&#8217;t &#8220;model&#8221; a great marriage for, confessing that she &#8220;wanted to be different from them.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then Isabel fell in love &#8220;and wanted it to truly stick,&#8221; adding: </p>



<p><strong><em>To be transparent, this has been a hard season for us. The past year was deeply challenging for our marriage. The strength of it has been tested a time or two. </em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>And the word divorce has come up more than once</em></strong>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-6.40.31%E2%80%AFAM-1024x701.png" alt="Tori, Zach and their kids for TLC" class="wp-image-491866"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tori, Zach Roloff and their kids for TLC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In May of last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/isabel-roloff-confesses-to-problems-in-marriage-due-to-mental-health-struggles/">Isabel previously said that her relationship was tested</a> amid her own mental health struggles.</p>



<p>“My marriage has been especially difficult to navigate with depression in the past,” the mother of one wrote said back then.</p>



<p>“I want nothing more than to be loved, but with depression it’s like a wall never allowing that love to truly land.</p>



<p>“These days, I am working on allowing all the I am given to actually land. I am still even trying to love myself.”</p>

<p>In this latest case, Isabel concluded: </p>



<p>&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s one thing to go your separate ways. If something is not working anymore, I do think it is best to end it, but amicably. Becoming cruel to each other seemed like the worst way to handle thing, but that&#8217;s what my mom and dad ended up doing. </p>



<p>&#8220;My parents had an awful divorce that turned ugly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jacob Roloff left Little People, Big World way back in 2016.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s remained mostly out of the spotlight ever since, too.</p>



<p>And yet:</p>



<p>Despite not filming episode of this reality show with his dad any longer, it&#8217;s become evident that Jacob has developed quite a bond with Matt Roloff, as evidenced by a few recent example.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matt and Jacob Roloff are side by side in this photo, posing on the former&#8217;s tractor and also on his farm.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For one thing, Jacob and his immediate family are actually <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/little-people-big-news-jacob-roloff-to-move-on-to-fathers-farm/">moving on to his father&#8217;s property</a>, at Matt told social media followers last month.</p>



<p>“I’ve been living in the one-story home, and when I move into the new house, Izzy and Jacob are going to move in where I was,&#8221; Matt explained of the two living situations amid renovations on his farm.</p>



<p>Jacob, his wife and their infant son (Mateo) have mostly been living in an RV for years… driving around the Pacific Northwest and living pretty much as nomads.</p>



<p>It sounds like they&#8217;ll soon be settling down a bit, though.</p>

<p>Now, meanwhile, The Sun has published an interview with Matt&#8217;s brother, Sam, an artist with an upcoming exhibit in San Francisco.</p>



<p>In this feature, Sam says he keeps in closer touch with Jacob than any other niece or nephew.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been down here to see my house and whatnot, so I probably have a better relationship with Jacob than of all of them,&#8221; <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/9485752/little-people-big-world-matt-roloff-brother-sam-favorite-nephew-jacob/">Sam told The Sun of Jacob</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s actually working with my son Max right now at the farm. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re doing work at the pumpkin patch.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">What a lovely photo here of Jacob Rolloff, his wife, his nephew and his famous dad, Matt.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Zach Roloff notably did NOT attend pumpkin season this year at Roloff Farms due to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/matt-roloff-to-zach-and-tori-youre-basically-dead-to-me/">an ongoing feud with Matt</a>.</p>



<p>Molly Roloff has lived a quiet life in Washington for years now and doesn&#8217;t seem especially close to either of her parents.</p>



<p>Jeremy Roloff actually moved into his <em>own</em> farm last year, along with his wife and three kids, and seems very bitter that Matt didn&#8217;t give him a fair chance to buy his farm in the spring of 2022.</p>



<p>This leaves Jacob.</p>

<p>About three years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/jacob-roloff-accuses-little-people-big-world-producer-of-molesta/">Jacob came out and said a TLC producers molested</a> him awhile back&#8230; prompting his departure from Little People, Big World.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is often much easier to think about things than it is to talk about them, and so this disclosure has been delayed, but through that delay I have found the fortitude and words,&#8221; began Jacob back then, prior to issuing the claim:</p>



<p><em>As a child, after what I realize now was a long grooming process, I was molested by an executive field producer for ‘Little People, Big World,’ Chris Cardamone.</em></p>



<p>Jacob went on to say that he would not be sharing any details about this alleged encounter at any point.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jacob Roloff is pictured here back in the day with his dad.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Continued Jacob at the time:</p>



<p>&#8220;By revealing this, I may be more fully understood and my perspective on issues such as child sexual abuse, child exploitation, and the collateral costs of reality television may be received more clearly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although, I would have to add that this experience has not solely defined my point of view on any of these issues, nor as it defined my worldview in general&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;It must finally be emphasized that all fault lies with the predator, and no fault lies with any of my family.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am certain that this is a positive moment for me, and another step toward a brighter future.&#8221;</p>

<p>For years, <em>Little People, Big World</em> alum Jacob Roloff has used his platform for good. His work <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/little-people-big-news-jacob-roloff-to-move-on-to-fathers-farm/">on his father&#8217;s farm</a> hasn&#8217;t changed that.</p>



<p>This month, he is raising awareness of the increasingly genocidal military campaign that Israel is carrying out against the people of Gaza.</p>



<p>Jacob is hoping to educate his followers.</p>



<p>He also has a message of hope: that we will all see a Free Palestine in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>Last week, as Israel stepped up its campaign of bombing and starvation against the people of Gaza, Jacob Roloff spoke out on Instagram.</p>



<p>&#8220;People can browbeat all they want, but we will see a free Palestine in our lifetime,&#8221; he began optimistically.</p>



<p>&#8220;What’s happening now is an atrocity to the Palestinians,&#8221; he acknowledged, &#8220;as they are bombed &#8216;to dust&#8217; (as one IDF soldier bragged).&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jacob Roloff pauses his work on Roloff Farms for a moment so that his father can snap a photo as they prepare for Pumpkin Season 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jacob referred to the ongoing ethnic cleansing &#8220;with dozens of whole bloodlines already wiped out, and whole towns disappeared from the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gravely, he stated: &#8220;The crimes visited on them not only in the past 18 years but since the Nakba of 1948 can’t be easily waved away.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jacob also recognized: &#8220;And the U.S. too is complicit in this ethnic cleansing.&#8221; For generations, human rights experts have referred to the settler violence and apartheid that Palestinians face as &#8220;<em>peacetime ethnic cleansing</em>.&#8221; In recent weeks, the only part of this to change has been the &#8220;<em>peacetime</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can excuse it, nor the stated desire by Israeli defense ministers and prime ministers for genocide,&#8221; Jacob affirmed.</p>



<p>One of the photos that Jacob shared included a quote from the Israeli Defense Minister, vowing to &#8220;eliminate everything&#8221; in Gaza.</p>



<p>&#8220;This first rate military has the Palestinian people corralled in the worlds largest open air prison that they cannot leave,&#8221; Jacob accurately described. </p>

Good for him!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jacob Roloff continued: &#8220;with more than 500 military checkpoints within their small strip.&#8221;</p>



<p>He cited: &#8220;Unable to fish more than 4 nautical miles offshore (where the deep sea lanes and bigger fish are).&#8221;</p>



<p>Jacob went on, noting &#8220;their water wells cemented in, their orchards bulldozed, and their homes stolen from under them, and at gun point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the power to shut off all electricity, water, food, and medical supply lines,&#8221; he listed.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are looking at the extermination of a people,&#8221; Jacob acknowledged.</p>



<p>He ended his caption with an aspirational: &#8220;Free Palestine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The photos that Jacob shared included more detail, highlighting how Israel&#8217;s bombardment of Gaza has targeted crowded markets and shopping areas, leveling buildings with dozens of victims unable to escape.</p>



<p>Jacob sited reports that seriously doubt the dubious claims that a &#8220;Hamas rocket&#8221; destroyed the hospital.</p>



<p>He also cited that Israel has now destroyed 42% of Gaza&#8217;s housing. That&#8217;s hundreds of thousands of people &#8212; mostly children &#8212; who have lost their homes. That tragic figure has obviously risen since Jacob first shared it.</p>

<p>Given the widespread lack of political literacy in the United States, it&#8217;s no surprise that people showed up to argue with Jacob.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s always interesting when people try to &#8220;whatabout&#8221; when the topic is the wholesale slaughter of civilians, including children.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most succinct counter would simply be: &#8220;right now we&#8217;re talking about this because our country is helping to make it happen.&#8221; Not that Jacob&#8217;s lengthier responses weren&#8217;t worthwhile, too.</p>

<p>Matt Roloff may be feuding with a certain segment of his famous family.</p>



<p>But he&#8217;s apparently getting along better than ever with another segment.</p>



<p>According to the Little People, Big World star &#8212; via an Instagram Q&amp;A with fans that involved at least one asking about construction on his farm &#8212; son Jacob is actually moving on to his property.</p>

<p>Amid ongoing renovations to his farm, Matt told followers this week: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been living in the one-story home, and when I move into the new house, Izzy and Jacob are going to move in where I was.&#8221;</p>



<p>This one-story residence sits on the $4 million Roloff Farms estate between the family home featured on TLC and the long-time construction of Matt&#8217;s new dream house.</p>



<p>He and fiance Caryn Chandler will be moving into this mansion upon its completion.</p>

<p>Jacob, his wife and their infant son (Mateo) have mostly been living in an RV for years&#8230; driving around the Pacific Northwest and living pretty much as nomads.</p>



<p>The former left his family&#8217;s reality show in 2016 and claimed years later that a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/jacob-roloff-accuses-little-people-big-world-producer-of-molesta/">producer sexually assaulted him</a> on set.</p>



<p>Ever since this time, Jacob has remained mostly out of the spotlight.</p>



<p>On occasion, his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/isabel-roloff-fires-back-at-body-shamers-tells-trolls-to-unlearn-your-fatphobia/">spouse will fire back at body-shaming trolls</a> in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Matt, meanwhile, put a portion of his farm up for sale about a year and a half ago. He has not yet agreed to any deal.</p>



<p>The mere decision to place the property on the market has created quite a lot of inner Roloff turmoil, though, most notably between Matt and his son, Zach.</p>



<p>The latter objected to the way in which his dad tried to explain the decision to sale, claiming in the process that he initially gave his kids a chance to buy the farm at a discount.</p>



<p>Zach definitely does not see things this way.</p>

<p>In a stunning public call-out last May, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/9004140/little-people-tori-roloff-upset-matt-connor-chandler/">Zach trashed his dad as a manipulating coward</a>, writing over a year ago of the way in which Matt explained how he arrived at the farm sale:</p>



<p>“This post is extremely misguided and false. My dad is manipulating the narrative right now before the season comes out,” Zach wrote online back then.</p>



<p>Wow, huh?</p>



<p>From what we can tell, Zach and wife Tori still aren&#8217;t really talking to Matt, who also remains a bit estranged from Zach&#8217;s twin brother, Jeremy.</p>



<p>As you can tell by the housing information passed along above, however, things seem to be just fine between Matt and Jacob.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Even if she sometimes regrets it, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/isabel-roloff-accused-of-marrying-jacob-for-fame-after-confessional-post/">Isabel Roloff shared a lot about herself</a> with fans and followers.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s not personally a <em>Little People, Big World</em> star &#8212; but she knows that a lot of people have followed her and Jacob&#8217;s love story.</p>



<p>One thing that she and her husband share less of is their son, Mateo. They are respecting his privacy. Because he&#8217;s a <em>person</em>.</p>



<p>Every now and then, however, fans get a little glimpse of their precious one-and-a-half-year-old.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In June of 2023, on the eve of the Summer Solstice, Isabel Roloff shared this glorious and very floral sunlight photo. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This week, Isabel Roloff took to her Instagram Story to share portions of a cute family outing.</p>



<p>Some if it involved watching a performance. But, for followers, this was not the highlight.</p>



<p>Little Mateo, who will turn 2 years old in several months, spent time by the river on this sunny day.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In July of 2023, proud mom Isabel Roloff shared this photo of little Mateo Roloff enjoying the beauty of nature. She did this while continuing to respect his privacy.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see, Mateo woere a blue shirt, what appear to be blue shorts or trunks, and a periwinkle fishing hat.</p>



<p>What a cute and smart way to protect his face, head, and neck from needless irradiation! And he&#8217;s so stylish!</p>



<p>&#8220;Then a quick river dip after,&#8221; Isabel shared in a caption across the photo. As you can see, the water was both calm and shallow &#8212; and Isabel was right near him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabel Roloff shared this car selfie with her followers in an Instagram post.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As always, she did not show precious little Mateo&#8217;s face. This policy has prompted outrage and even some vile rumors from very strange people.</p>



<p>The truth is that Isabel and Jacob respect Mateo&#8217;s privacy enough to not plaster his face all across social media.</p>



<p>Remember, these aren&#8217;t just a pair of parents avoiding sharing pics of their preschooler. They&#8217;re public figures.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On her Story, Isabel Roloff celebrated a family &#8220;zoo day&#8221; trip featuring a rare glimpse at precious little Mateo Roloff. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That is why Mateo&#8217;s face wouldn&#8217;t just show up to a few hundred acquaintances, but thousands &#8212; or more &#8212; if they posted him.</p>



<p>And that is also why Jacob and Isabel both know the stakes when it comes to Mateo&#8217;s wellness and future.</p>



<p>Jacob grew up famous. He was a reality star as a child. And it was entirely against his will.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabel Roloff and Jacob Roloff took their son, Mateo, to the zoo on this snowy day.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, for now, forcing your child to become a reality TV personality before an audience of millions is legal.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s not even the worst thing that parents can legally put their kids through! Truly, in so many ways, our world is a lottery based upon who your parents are &#8212; a lottery that most people lose)</p>



<p>Jacob was able to quit <em>Little People, Big World</em> at 18. Though he had every right to ghost his family for life, he has since reconciled with his parents.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabel Roloff, formerly known as Isabel Rock, holds 7-month-old Mateo while walking in the woods.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jacob learned the hard way what it means for your parents to decide that your face will be famous. TLC-famous, but still.</p>



<p>He and Isabel aren&#8217;t going to put Mateo through that.</p>



<p>If Mateo one day wants the world to see his face, then that will be his choice. It&#8217;s not one that they will make for him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabel Roloff hugs her son close in this photo of the occasional reality star and little Mateo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There is also another angle. They have seen how little Mateo&#8217;s cousins are the subjects of intense scrutiny.</p>



<p>Hey, it takes a village to raise a child. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/tori-roloff-shares-new-video-of-jackson-as-fans-worry-over-his-legs/">Honest concern over a child&#8217;s health</a> is not malicious. But sometimes, concern trolling and mom-shaming takes over.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s really no room for that with Mateo. And if too many people get weird about him playing by the river or whatever, Isabel and Jacob can just post even less of him.</p>

And online estimates put her net worth at around $6 million. That doesn&#8217;t mean a vault full of six million dollar bills, of course, but the sum total of her assets. </p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Where does it come from?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">2</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>It&#8217;s unlikely that Amy&#8217;s time on the show accounts for all of her money. It&#8217;s likely that, in early seasons, she and Matt only made five or maybe something in the low six figures per year from Little People, Big World. Perhaps they began to make more in later seasons (that&#8217;s likely), but there have also been fewer episodes in recent seasons. Amy did make over $600k from selling her share of the farm (meaning that Matt got it at a steal, considering potential value). But Amy also has Amy Roloff&#8217;s Little Kitchen, and she wrote a book. These were ways for her to monetize her fame and life experiences and build her personal wealth.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Matt Roloff</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">3</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Estimates claim that Matt has a $6 million net worth, and while that&#8217;s likely not the exact figure, it sounds like a decent ballpark. The guy&#8217;s sitting on a lot of money in the farmland, and the mansion that he&#8217;s building for himself and Caryn Chandler is going to grow the financial value even further. </p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>So where did it come from?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">4</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Matt had the same TLC paychecks as Amy, and worked for Fortune 500 companies before giving it all up to become a pumpkin farmer. He also has books, including a children&#8217;s book. Matt has definitely poured a lot of money into his latest project, but can you really put a price on a comfortable dream home? (Well, yes, that&#8217;s what the contractor does)</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>And the next generation?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">5</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>We&#8217;re not going to speculate on the net worths of the grandkids &#8212; though we&#8217;re torn between finding jokes about tooth fairy money for their baby teeth ghoulish and adorable. But Matt and Amy have four adult children. While online estimates are likely not right on the money, they remain a good ballpark for kids who grew up on reality TV and are the scions of reasonably famous millionaires.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Jeremy Roloff</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">6</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Though online estimates place Jeremy&#8217;s net worth at only about $700,000, one imagines that it could be higher. The 4-acre farm that he and Audrey purchased is no Roloff Farms, but it has a land value of about $1.5 million. Even divided by half (Audrey is, in fact, a person too) you&#8217;d think that his net worth would have to be a bit higher.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Where does it come from</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">7</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>We don&#8217;t claim to be able to fill in all of the blanks, but Audrey has spent years promoting products &#8212; some dubious, others not &#8212; on social media. Many fans associate her with the essential oils that she hawks. They also wrote a book on marriage advice, though their marriage was fairly young at the time (and, frankly, still is by many standards). They spent years on reality TV as adults. Oh, and they recently undertook a project to convert a cabin into a vacation rental.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Zach Roloff</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">8</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Once again, online estimates speculate that Zach has a net worth of about $700,000. That is &#8230; oddly similar to Jeremy&#8217;s net worth, even though the twins have gone down very different life paths. Zach and Tori&#8217;s home had a purchase value of just under $1 million, and they hadn&#8217;t even sold their former home before buying it.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Where does it come from?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">9</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>Some fans wonder if Zach has made money from playing or coaching soccer, but if he has, some argue that it&#8217;s likely that he didn&#8217;t rake in even as much as Tori did teaching kindergarten. Instead, it&#8217;s likely that a lot of their money came from Little People, Big World, and they remain part of the show &#8212; adding years of TLC paydays. Zach also worked on Roloff Farms for a long time, helping with those pricey tours. Finally, like Audrey, Tori works as an influencer on social media, which can mean raking in some sweet, easy money &#8230; even if you cringe while doing it.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Molly Roloff</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">10</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>We didn&#8217;t forget about Molly, did you? Molly isn&#8217;t a reality TV star now &#8212; or even recently. She&#8217;s also not a social media influencer. She&#8217;s a senior accountant at Nordstrom when last we checked, and living a normal life. While online estimates put her net worth at around $700,000, we have to wonder if someone just figured that it was a safe bet that the siblings all have more or less equal assets. That might be a mistake on their part.</p></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>Jacob Roloff</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">11</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>While Jeremy remained on reality TV for many years and Zach continues his TLC role to this day, Jacob was unhappy with his involuntary TV stardom for years. When he turned 18, he left the show and Roloff Farms behind &#8212; which likely means that he has never received one direct cent for Little People, Big World. Despite that, online estimates guesstimate his net worth in the ballpark of $700,000. Which, as we said with Molly, is likely a mistake.</p><div class="thg-ad-wrapper"><div class="mv_slot_target" data-slot="content"></div></div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><h2>So how does Jacob make a living?</h2><div class="gallery-index-container"><div class="gallery-index">12</div></div><hr><div class="gallery-image-container"></div><p>He is (wisely) very judicious about how much he shares with the world. But we know that Jacob helps out on Roloff Farms &#8212; which is likely a paid job. We know that Jacob is a published author. And given his social media interests and comments from Matt, it&#8217;s likely that Jacob is in the hemp industry. It looks like he and his wife, Sofia (who is an artist) are doing just fine with their boy, little Mateo. We don&#8217;t know about $700k, but six figures might not be a stretch.</p></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Since embarking upon the journey of motherhood, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/isabel-roloff-asks-for-parenting-affirmations-i-know-im-a-good-parent-but/">Isabel Roloff has focused upon being a good parent</a>.</p>



<p>She and Jacob welcomed their son in December of 2021. They are clearly making sure that they do not repeat Jacob&#8217;s parents&#8217; mistakes.</p>



<p>Part of that has meant keeping Mateo out of the public eye. This very basic appreciation of their son&#8217;s human rights has proven controversial among some <em>Little People, Big World</em> fans.</p>



<p>It has also meant that photos of the toddler are very rare. Which makes this pic extra special: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On her Story, Isabel Roloff celebrated a family &#8220;zoo day&#8221; trip featuring a rare glimpse at precious little Mateo Roloff on Jacob Roloff&#8217;s shoulders. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just a few days ago, Isabel Roloff took to her Instagram Stories.</p>



<p>There, she posted a photo of Jacob Roloff, her caption making it clear that it was a &#8220;zoo day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Little Mateo, who will be 15 months old later this week, is perched on Jacob&#8217;s shoulders.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Zoo trips are clearly a family favorite &#8212; for the trips themselves, and for these rare photos.</p>



<p>Mateo&#8217;s face is not any more visible now than it was for any of the previous pics. And that&#8217;s just the way that Jacob and Izzy want it.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a toddler. His focus isn&#8217;t on achieving Instagram fame, and he has no grasp of what that could mean. Instead, the wee one was probably just really excited to view the animal exhibits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabel Roloff, formerly known as Isabel Rock, holds 7-month-old Mateo while walking in the woods.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Isabel doesn&#8217;t always have to go so far as to include a screenshot of how far she has walked that day to redact pics of Mateo.</p>



<p>Clearly, this time, a little too much of him was showing for comfort.</p>



<p>Their respect for his personhood is commendable. If Jacob&#8217;s parents had felt the same way during his childhood, things could have been much better for him on several levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jacob Roloff looks down at his young son in this sweet photo. The star&#8217;s firstborn is named Mateo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember, Isabel and Jacob aren&#8217;t just guessing about what life might be like for their son if they plaster his face all over the internet.</p>



<p>That ship sailed for Jackson, Mateo&#8217;s eldest cousin, the moment that he entered the world. Zach and Tori were (and are) <em>Little People, Big World</em> stars.</p>



<p>Jacob quit reality TV the moment that it became an option for him &#8212; that is to say, the moment that he became 18. (Which is a great reminder that our country needs federal regulations to protect minors from reality TV exploitation)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Isabel Roloff hugs her son close in this photo of the occasional reality star and little Mateo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That meant that he and Isabel, though public figures themselves by virtue of Jacob&#8217;s childhood and family ties, could give Mateo a clean slate.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about more than just not filming him for TLC or letting producers follow his young life.</p>



<p>Even Instagram pics could become a target for harassment, cruel comments, and more. Not to mention that they would also be an indelible record of his life that Mateo might grow up to resent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Just because <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/jacob-roloff-reveals-paltry-reality-show-salary-says-tv-sucks-yo/">Jacob Roloff escaped the soul-sucking world of reality television</a> doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;s no longer a public figure. His parents made that choice for him long ago.</p>



<p>That means that the eyes of <em>Little People, Big World</em> fans are always upon him.</p>



<p>Some of those eyes belong to parent-shaming trolls with malice in their hearts and worms between their ears.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Jacob knows how to put them in their place. And he doesn&#8217;t have to say much at all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>How did this latest nonsense start? With a totally innocuous Instagram post that Jacob Roloff made.</p>



<p>He, his wife Isabel, and their one-year-old Mateo, enjoyed an enviously snowy day and visited the zoo.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sweet Mateo is one year old today,&#8221; Jacob began his caption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Perfect snowy day at the zoo,&#8221; he then described.</p>



<p>&#8220;With,&#8221; Jacob continued, &#8220;almost no one else there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sounds like a dream! Especially for those of us still experiencing uncomfortably warm weather.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jacob Roloff looks down at his young son in this sweet photo. The star&#8217;s firstborn is named Mateo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jacob also provided an update on how their excited baby is developing.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s signing &#8216;more&#8217; and &#8216;dog&#8217; (and getting close to &#8216;book&#8217;),&#8221; Jacob announced.</p>



<p>&#8220;And getting more and more confident walking every day,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Sweet sweet sweet boy.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>All of that is very sweet, right?</p>



<p>It is.</p>



<p>Unless, of course, you are a malicious person who harbors several extremely bad opinions and zero filters to stop you from sharing them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>One commenter raged with an absurd foaming-at-the-mouth take about Jacob and Isabel teaching sign language to Mateo.</p>



<p>&#8220;So ridiculous to teach sign when they aren&#8217;t deaf,&#8221; this absurd troll declared.</p>



<p>&#8220;You going to give him insulin too if he doesn&#8217;t have diabetes?&#8221; the twisted dad-shamer mocked. &#8220;So stupid. Be grateful he can hear.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Some comments are worth blocking or simply ignoring. Others merit a direct reply.</p>



<p>In this case, Jacob shared a screenshot of the unhinged and deeply wrong attempt at trolling.</p>



<p>Jacob&#8217;s sole commentary got straight to the point: &#8220;This is the most entertaining sort of brain rot.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jacob Roloff and wife Isabel are out and about and buying a Christmas tree in this cute photo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, first and foremost, we just have to point out the most obvious flaw in this troll&#8217;s &#8220;thinking.&#8221; If you can even call it that.</p>



<p>Sign language doesn&#8217;t work if only deaf people know it. Otherwise their communication is pretty limited.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s sort of like all other languages in that respect. &#8220;Language&#8221; is right there in the name. Just a no-brainer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SMOOCH! Jacob Roloff lays a wet one here on the cheek of soulmate Isabel Rock.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it is an intrinsic good for more people to know sign language, that is not the only reason for an infant to learn.</p>



<p>Learning sign language can help with motor skills, language skills, and communication at an early age.</p>



<p>Speech therapists who are helping children with issues like speech delays or selective mutism often teach sign language. It helps to stimulate the same parts of the brain as other languages. <em>Because it is a language</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>In fact, there are advocates who suggest that teaching sign language in elementary school replace the useless antiquated nonsense of cursive writing.</p>



<p>Unless an ancient document springs to life, you will never desperately need to write cursive to communicate with someone. Sign language, on the other hand, can be a vital tool.</p>



<p>For now, we don&#8217;t know Jacob and Isabel&#8217;s reasons for teaching sign language to Mateo. We don&#8217;t have to. It doesn&#8217;t matter. And it&#8217;s not our business.</p>
