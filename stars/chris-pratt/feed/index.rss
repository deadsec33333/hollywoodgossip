<p>Chris Pratt got an eyeful of brother-in-law Patrick Schwarzenegger.</p>



<p>Of course, so did everyone tuning in to <em>The White Lotus</em> Season 3 and seeing the actor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/arnold-patrick-schwarzenegger-the-white-lotus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frontal nudity scene</a>.</p>



<p>But we can all understand that it&#8217;s a little different for members of his family. </p>



<p>After his parents shared their statements, his A-list actor brother-in-law is offering a pretty blunt appraisal.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="709" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-1024x709.jpg" alt="Patrick Schwarzenegger with his mother Maria Shriver, sister Katherine Schwarzenegger, and her husband Chris Pratt in February 2025." class="wp-image-520108" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-2048x1418.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-960x665.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-1080x748.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_patrickschwarzenegger_02-1200x831.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patrick Schwarzenegger with his mother Maria Shriver, sister Katherine Schwarzenegger, and her husband Chris Pratt attend the season three premiere of HBO&#8217;s &#8220;The White Lotus&#8221; at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles on February 10, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chris-pratt-has-nothing-but-praise-for-patrick-schwarzenegger-on-the-white-lotus">Chris Pratt has nothing but praise for Patrick Schwarzenegger on &#8216;The White Lotus&#8217;</h2>



<p>Our society is very weird about nudity and doubly so about male nudity (or at least, weird in a different way than about women). The ensuing awkwardness means that, sometimes, the best response is to crack a joke.</p>



<p>While speaking to <em><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1413915/chris-pratt-has-the-ultimate-nsfw-reaction-to-patrick-schwarzeneggers-white-lotus-scene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a></em>, Chris Pratt did just that about brother-in-law Patrick Schwarzenegger hanging dong during <em>The White Lotus</em>&#8216; third season.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know where my eyes went,&#8221; he heartily confessed on Monday, February 24.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt on February 24, 2025." class="wp-image-520102" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt attend the World Premiere of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;The Electric State&#8221; at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood on February 24, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Chris Pratt was quick to emphasize that his southward glance at Patrick Schwarzenegger&#8217;s frontal nudity was not incestuous in any meaningful sense.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not blood-related to him,&#8221; he pointed out. Pratt did not stop discussing his brother-in-law in very direct terms, either.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was looking at that d&#8211;k, bro,&#8221; Pratt announced. So, obviously, were many people. Though we here at <em>THG </em>wouldn&#8217;t necessarily recommend tuning in to <em>The White Lotus</em> purely for the jumbo-sized Vienna sausage. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chris-pratt-praised-patrick-schwarzenegger-as-a-physical-specimen">Chris Pratt praised Patrick Schwarzenegger as a &#8216;physical specimen&#8217;</h2>



<p>“No, he looks amazing. Obviously, he’s a physical specimen,&#8221; Chris Pratt praised accurately. &#8220;But also he’s a really solid actor, because the character he’s playing is completely different than who he is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some actors tend to get cast to play slightly exaggerated versions of themselves in many different roles. The best actors get to branch out.</p>



<p>Pratt praised his brother-in-law for bringing to life a character that &#8220;feels natural and good.&#8221; He went on to gush: “I’ve been telling everybody for years, I’ve been telling him as well, I really think we’re entering a decade of Patrick.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we previously reported, Arnold Schwarzenegger raved over his son&#8217;s nude scene. Arnold himself posed nude before rising to mega-fame, and later appeared in various states of undress during some of his most iconic film roles.</p>



<p>Additionally, Maria Shriver admitted to <em><a href="https://people.com/maria-shriver-reacts-to-son-patrick-schwarzenegger-white-lotus-nude-scenes-exclusive-11684739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> </em>that she missed her son&#8217;s blink-and-you-miss-it dong scene.</p>



<p>“My kids were like, ‘Did you see that?’ And I was like, ‘No. What?&#8217;” she confessed. Shriver then added oddly: “So that shows you &#8212; a mother’s eyes are always on the kids’ eyes.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Maria Shriver, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Katherine Schwarzenegger, and Chris Pratt on March 23, 2023." class="wp-image-520100" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_chrispratt_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maria Shriver, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Katherine Schwarzenegger, and Chris Pratt attend the Netflix Unstable S1 premiere at Netflix Tudum Theater on March 23, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-these-comments-a-little-over-the-top">Are these comments a little over the top?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re not going to question Maria Shriver&#8217;s odd remark about mothers and their eyes. She has, one might argue, been famous for too many decades to speak like a normal person.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Chris Pratt was hoping to break the tension that our weird, sex-negative culture imposes. Believe it or not, many men in our society have no idea what the men that they know look like naked. They must lead lives full of mystery &#8230; until one of them stars on prestige television.</p>



<p>Or maybe he just wanted to praise his brother-in-law. Despite his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/chris-pratt-tries-to-rebrand-im-not-a-religious-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past statements</a> and the way that his public image has soured, many who know him say that Chris Pratt is a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/chris-pratt-anna-faris-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good guy</a>. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re an A-list actor, being a good guy means singing the praises of your famous-but lesser-known actor bro-in-law. And, when appropriate, the praises of his dong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/chris-pratt-ticks-off-entire-internet-hides-behind-religion-afte/">Chris Pratt managed to piss off the entire internet</a>.</p>



<p>In response to the backlash, he attempted to hide behind his faith. He&#8217;s done it before.</p>



<p>This is part of a larger pattern for Chris, whose former fans have begun to dislike him in recent years.</p>



<p>The internet&#8217;s least favorite Chris is trying to repair his image in a new, unconvincing interview.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Before we unpack Chris Pratt&#8217;s spin, let&#8217;s take a look at what he actually said.</p>



<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a40289867/chris-pratt-interview-new-movies-series/">Men&#8217;s Health</a></em>, he is first and foremost expressing remorse for shading his ex-wife &#8230; and son.</p>



<p>He made creepy comments about wife Katherine Schwarzenegger staring at him in adoration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>It reminded people of of how fundamentalist wives are expected to smile worshipfully at their husbands.</p>



<p>That was not all, of course, but that is where Pratt began.</p>



<p>&#8220;I said something like, &#8216;Find someone who looks at you the way my wife looks at me,'&#8221; he acknowledged.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;And then I gave her some s&#8211;t in the thing,&#8221; Pratt characterized. </p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he continued, he &#8220;said, &#8216;But I love you. I&#8217;m so thankful for my wife.'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;She gave me a beautiful, healthy daughter,&#8221; Pratt recalled his statement. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The issue, of course, was that Pratt&#8217;s child with Anna Faris was born prematurely.</p>



<p>Many of Pratt&#8217;s fans and critics alike believe that this health crisis led to Pratt tilting towards more extreme religious zeal.</p>



<p>Frankly, it was hard to read this as anything but a slight towards his ex and his son.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Then a bunch of articles came out and said, &#8216;That&#8217;s so cringeworthy,'&#8221; Pratt recalled.</p>



<p>He cited articles saying &#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t believe Chris Pratt would thank her for a healthy daughter when his first child was born premature.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Pratt continued: &#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s such a dig at his ex-wife.&#8217; And I&#8217;m like, That is f&#8211;ked up.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>(Getty Images for Disney)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;My son&#8217;s gonna read that one day,&#8221; Pratt then acknowledged.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s nine,&#8221; he noted, hinting that <em>one day</em> could easily mean <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Pratt characterized, &#8220;it&#8217;s etched in digital stone.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;It really f&#8211;king bothered me, dude. I cried about it,&#8221; Pratt expressed.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;I was like, I hate that these blessings in my life are &#8212; to the people close to me &#8212; a real burden.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be clear, people were reasonably happy about his daughter&#8217;s health, but took issue with <em>how </em>he celebrated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Chris Pratt also acknowledged that, for some mysterious reason, people think that he&#8217;s especially religious.</p>



<p>Obviously, being a Christian isn&#8217;t why &#8220;may Chris Pratt be cast to voice your favorite character&#8221; is a curse.</p>



<p>Instead, people take issue with Pratt&#8217;s &#8220;alleged&#8221; affiliation with the infamous Hillsong Church and with its eerily similar offshoot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“Religion has been oppressive as fuck for a long time,” Pratt noted to <em>Men&#8217;s Health</em>.</p>



<p>That is a bit of a generalization, but he is hardly the first to conflate evangelical Christianity with faith as a concept.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know that I would kind of become the face of religion,&#8221; he claimed, &#8220;when really I’m not a religious person.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I think there’s a distinction between being <em>religious</em> &#8212; adhering to the customs created by man,&#8221; Pratt began. </p>



<p>He explained: &#8220;oftentimes appropriating the awe reserved for who I believe is a very real God.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pratt continued: &#8220;And using it to control people, to take money from people, to abuse children, to steal land, to justify hatred.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Whatever it is,&#8221; Pratt went on.</p>



<p>&#8220;The evil that’s in the heart of every single man has glommed on to the back of religion,&#8221; he characterized.</p>



<p>Pratt then added: &#8220;And come along for the ride.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Interestingly, Pratt denies having attended Hillsong Church, a controversial organization.</p>



<p>Hillsong is an international megachurch. It famously caters to celebrities, utilizes youth culture, and had various scandals.</p>



<p>Though Pratt went on to attend Zoe Church, people saw <em>and photographed</em> him attending Hillsong in 2017.</p>

Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt are now engaged.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Throwing Hillsong under the bus seems like an easy deflection, but is Zoe Church really any better?</p>



<p>Pastor Chad Veach executive produced a 2017 film that equated cheating and &#8220;sexual brokenness&#8221; to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like Pratt doesn&#8217;t know about Veach; the two are also golfing buddies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Chris Pratt has his face covered, but this is really him from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps Chris Pratt is just trying to clear the air, but the timing of this interview after months of silence suggests otherwise.</p>



<p>More likely, his critics suggest, he is trying to spin his image ahead of <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>, where he reprises his role as Peter Quill.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t have to mean that he&#8217;s lying to the world. He may not be being entirely honest with himself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>On a final note, I want to make it clear that no one thinks that Chris Pratt is evil, or hates him for being a Christian.</p>



<p>His coworkers all say that he&#8217;s a great guy to be around, and 60% of the country is of that faith.</p>



<p>But if he wants to get people to <em>like </em>him, more honesty and transparency would help. Rewriting history, not so much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Usually, when a celebrity couple announces that they&#8217;re expecting a baby, the news is met with unmitigated joy on social media.</p>
<p>However, Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger have developed a rather complex reputation in recent weeks, so their latest announcement might attract a few haters.</p>
<p>But before we get to the reaction, let&#8217;s reveal the big news:</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://people.com/parents/chris-pratt-katherine-schwarzenegger-pregnant-expecting-second-baby-exclusive/?utm_source=instagram&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=people_people&amp;utm_term=curalate_like2buy">new report</a> from <em>People</em> magazine, multiple sources have confirmed that Chris and Katherine are expecting their second child!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Andy from <em>Parks and Rec</em> and the daughter of the guy from <em>Kindergarten Cop</em> are planning to pop out another one!</p>
<p>Who could have a problem with that, right?</p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;re afraid we have some bad news, hypothetical reader who&#8217;s interested enough in this couple to read an article about them but completely in the dark about the latest developments in their personal lives:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>You see, <a href="/videos/chris-pratt-ticks-off-entire-internet-hides-behind-religion-afte/">Pratt ticked off the entire internet</a> recently when he posted a lengthy tribute to his wife that some felt was insensitive to his ex, Anna Faris, and their children together.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys. For real. Look how she&rsquo;s looking at me!&quot; Pratt wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of himself and Katherine.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean. Find you somebody that looks at you like that!! You know!?&quot; the actor continued.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We met in church. She&rsquo;s given me an amazing life, a gorgeous healthy daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>That line rubbed some folks the wrong way, as they felt that the remark failed to take Faris&#8217; feelings into account.</p>
<p>Pratt and Faris have a son, Jack, who was born nine weeks prematurely in 2012, weighing less than four pounds and having multiple health issues.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-683x1024.jpg" alt="Pratt with Faris" class="wp-image-276311" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-735x1102.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/pratt-with-faris-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Pratt probably didn&#8217;t intend to contrast the two situations, but the remark was not well-received on social media.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only part of the caption that pissed people off, as Pratt also made a few tongue-in-cheek remarks about his wife that some folks interpreted as unkind.</p>
<p>&quot;She chews so loudly that sometimes i put in my ear buds to drown it out, but that&rsquo;s love!&quot; Pratt joked.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="806" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-806x1024.jpg" alt="Katherine Schwarzenegger Snapshot" class="wp-image-318995" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-236x300.jpg 236w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-768x976.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-1208x1536.jpg 1208w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-1611x2048.jpg 1611w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-735x934.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-264x335.jpg 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-273x347.jpg 273w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-409x520.jpg 409w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-503x640.jpg 503w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-604x768.jpg 604w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-755x960.jpg 755w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-850x1080.jpg 850w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-scaled.jpg 2014w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;She helps me with everything. In return, periodically, I open a jar of pickles. That&rsquo;s the trade.&quot;</p>
<p>Pratt later added that Katherine is his &quot;greatest treasure right next to my Ken Griffey Jr Upper Deck Rookie card,&quot; adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Which if you know, you know is saying a lot.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The couple still hasn&#8217;t made an official announcement, but Pratt has been making frequent references to his desire to expand his family lately.</p>
<p>&quot;I would love to have more, as many as the man upstairs will provide,&quot; he told an interviewer last month.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;ll do it. I&#8217;ll probably have to talk to Katherine about that but my plan is, let&#8217;s go.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-682x1024.jpg" alt="Chris Pratt Pose" class="wp-image-241454" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(2016 Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>In a recent interview with <em>Daily Pop</em>, Pratt stated that having a second kid helped him appreciate &quot;the uniqueness of the first child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When you have one child, you just think, &#8216;Oh that&#8217;s what babies are like,&#8217;&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And then a second child comes along, and they might do things differently from the get-go, and you say, &#8216;Oh wow, OK so that was actually unique what my first child had done,&#8217;&quot; the actor continued.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="778" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-778x1024.png" alt="Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt" class="wp-image-318993" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-778x1024.png 778w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-228x300.png 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-768x1011.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-735x968.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-254x335.png 254w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-264x347.png 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-395x520.png 395w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-486x640.png 486w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-583x768.png 583w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-729x960.png 729w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt-820x1080.png 820w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-and-chris-pratt.png 916w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Each child is unique and special and they&#8217;re not just punched out of a mold.&quot;</p>
<p>So it sounds like Chris and Katherine will soon have even more uniqueness to appreciate.</p>
<p>Regardless of your personal feelings toward the couple, hopefully you&#8217;ll join us in offering them a hearty congratulations!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>If you&#8217;ve spent any time on Twitter in the past week, then you may have come across a surprising controversy involving beloved actor-turned-&quot;we&#8217;re not really sure what to make of this guy&quot; actor Chris Pratt.</p>
<p>In his days as a sort of self-deprecating schlub, Pratt earned a following as the rare television star who doesn&#8217;t seem to think too highly of himself.</p>
<p>When he made the leap to big budget feature films, fans applauded his success and cited it as evidence that nice guys finish first.</p>
<p>But then it turned out that Pratt was more of an old school leading man than fans thought, and not necessarily in a good way.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Pratt, as it turned out, was not the type-B, Andy Dwyer sort that he initially seemed to be.</p>
<p>As we now know, he&#8217;s a hyper-ambitious fitness nut whose love of the spotlight might one day lead him into the political arena.</p>
<p>Not long after this stage in his career began,&nbsp;<a href="/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-did-his-success-ruin-their-marriage/">Pratt&#8217;s marriage to Anna Faris came to an end</a>&nbsp;and he embarked on a new relationship that seemed perfectly suited to the new Chris Pratt.</p>

<p>In 2019,&nbsp;<a href="/2019/06/chris-pratt-and-katherine-schwarzenegger-married/">Pratt married Katherine Schwarzenegger</a>, daughter of the Governator, and insiders say he was thrilled to find a partner who shares his conservative, evangelical worldview.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pratt attempted to meld his old and new personas with a toungue-in-cheek Instagram tribute to his wife.</p>
<p>To say that it wasn&#8217;t well received would be putting it very mildly.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Find you somebody that looks at you like that!! You know!? We met in church,&quot; Pratt captioned the photo above.</p>
<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s given me an amazing life, a gorgeous healthy daughter, she chews so loudly that sometimes i put in my ear buds to drown it out, but that&rsquo;s love! She helps me with everything. In return, periodically, I open a jar of pickles. That&rsquo;s the trade,&quot; he joked.</p>
<p>&quot;Her heart is pure and it belongs to me. My greatest treasure right next to my Ken Griffey Jr Upper Deck Rookie card. Which if you know, you know is saying a lot. It&rsquo;s her birthday in about 6 weeks,&quot; Chris continued.</p>

<p>&quot;So if I don&rsquo;t get her anything, I&rsquo;ll tell her to look back on this post. Love you honey.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, the parts about the pickle jar and the Ken Griffey card were meant to be humorous, but for some critics, the jokes didn&#8217;t quite land.</p>
<p>Others blasted Chris for his comment about Katherine giving him a &quot;healthy daughter,&quot; as they inerpreted it as insensitive toward his developmentally disabled son.</p>

<p>Most of the angry commentary has come from Twitter anons, but at least one fellow celebrity has taken issue with Pratt&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>Busy Philipps lashed out at Pratt during a recent episode of her podcast, and &#8230; yeah, she really didn&#8217;t hold back.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew him in the before times, I don&#8217;t know him now,&quot; Philipps said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Holy s&#8212;. Either like you&#8217;re the dumbest mothef&#8212;er on Earth, or you&#8217;re a real righteous ass&#8211;le.&quot;</p>
<p>When Busy&#8217;s co-host asked her if she considered Pratt smart, the actress let him have it with both barrels.</p>
<p>&quot;Real talk. I don&#8217;t know. He drank a lot,&quot; she said, adding that Pratt was a &quot;doomsday prepper&quot; in those days.</p>

<p>&quot;My ladies &#8230; you&#8217;re probably not the type of lady that will laugh enthusiastically if you&#8217;re with a man and he starts to make very tired gender jokes about responsibilities and duties and even like, the f&#8211;king tired bit that he&#8217;s doing which is, &#8216;She runs the show I occasionally open a bag of pickles,&#8217;&quot; Philipps continued.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s how f&#8212;ing dumb what he said is,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;You are a Marvel superhero. You made $480 million last year. You work non-stop. You don&#8217;t just open a f&#8212;ing jar of pickles, you motherf&#8212;er &#8230; I hate it so much.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Philipps went on to imagine the division of labor in Chris and Katherine&#8217;s household:</p>
<p>&quot;What she does in their household is probably a lot. She probably does a lot of the domestic labor. They have a kid and whatever,&quot; she said of Pratt.</p>
<p>&quot;That is actually legitimately a lot of f&#8212;ing work. But by the way he&#8217;s talking about himself, putting himself in it, in the center of it, it makes it seem like it&#8217;s bulls&#8212;,&quot; Philipps continued before concluding with her most biting ciriticism yet:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="770" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-770x1024.jpg" alt="Very Busy" class="wp-image-106145" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-770x1024.jpg 770w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-226x300.jpg 226w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-768x1021.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-1155x1536.jpg 1155w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-1540x2048.jpg 1540w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-360x480.jpg 360w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-240x320.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-735x977.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-252x335.jpg 252w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-261x347.jpg 261w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-391x520.jpg 391w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-481x640.jpg 481w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-578x768.jpg 578w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-722x960.jpg 722w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-812x1080.jpg 812w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/very-busy-scaled.jpg 1925w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images for Roadside Attrac)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;He has possessions, and she is one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Pratt has yet to address the criticism directly, but in a recent Instagram post he admitted that certain online interactions had left him feeling &quot;really kind of upset and depressed,&quot; noting that he recently &quot;woke up feeling crappy&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew that if I put on my Christian music playlist, and I got out of the woods and ran that I&#8217;d feel better, but I just didn&#8217;t want to,&quot; Pratt said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-682x1024.jpg" alt="Chris Pratt Pose" class="wp-image-241454" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(2016 Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;And I did it anyways and, gosh, was I right. It felt amazing. I got out of the woods, got my blood pumping.&quot;</p>
<p>Pratt&#8217;s mother-in-law, Maria Shriver, came to his defense after his public drubbing:</p>
<p>&quot;i want to remind you today what a good man you are what a great father you are to jack and lyla what a great husband you are to katherine,&quot; she wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>&quot;what a great son in law you are to me and what a great sense of humor you have !!&quot; Shriver continued.</p>
<p>&quot;i love you chris keep being your wonderful self rise above the noise your kids love your family loves you your wife loves you what a beautiful life i&#8217;m proud of you xo.&quot;</p>
<p>We can understand why some folks might have felt that Pratt&#8217;s comments struck a sour note, but the people who know the actor best seem to feel that he&#8217;s just as lovable as he was in his <em>Parks and Rec</em> days.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, everyone&#8217;s least favorite Famous Chris creeped out and disgusted the internet.</p>
<p>The result was an outpouring of love and support for his ex-wife and an intense backlash towards Chris Pratt himself.</p>
<p>The Guardians of the Galaxy star appeared to insult not only his ex, but also his firstborn son.</p>
<p>He paid dearly for that shade, which left him in a foul mood.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>First, we have to set the stage in case there is some confusion, because not <em>everyone </em>views Chris Pratt the same way.</p>
<p>To many, he&#8217;s just a funny TV man who became an MCU actor. For some reason, the one that a lot of moms have a crush on.</p>
<p>But to others, there are serious issues with &quot;Crisp Ratt&quot; and his off-screen persona.</p>

<p>Any time that a Twitter poll goes around asking which &quot;Chris&quot; should be eliminated, Chris Pratt is the winner.</p>
<p>Part of that is because he goes up against Chris Evans, Chris Pines, and Chris Hemsworth &#8212; that is a very stacked deck.</p>
<p>The other reason is that many people no longer believe that he is a good person, and question if he ever was.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Years ago, Chris was called out by Elliot Page for attending a homophobic church.</p>
<p>Zoe Church, which he attends, is a spinoff of the infamous Hillsong Church, which is notorious for its views, practices, and for catering to celebrities.</p>
<p>Chris has alleged that Zoe Church is not bigoted because it &quot;opens its doors&quot; to &quot;everyone,&quot; which many felt was an evasive reply.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In addition to genuine concerns about Chris&#8217; moral stances, he also just seems to rub people the wrong way.</p>
<p>Recently, he has been announced as the voice of Mario in an upcoming film and in an upcoming Garfield film.</p>
<p>Many are tired of big name actors being cast over actual voice actors &#8230; but that goes <em>double </em>when they already dislike the actor.</p>

<p>So last week, on the heels of the world learning that he would voice yet another character, Chris posted a tribute to <a href="/2019/06/chris-pratt-and-katherine-schwarzenegger-married/">wife Katherine Schwarzenegger</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s an offensive photo that upsets fans. Sometimes, it&#8217;s a disrespectful caption.</p>
<p>This time, it&#8217;s a little of both, and they go hand in hand. Take a look:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Chris shared this photo of Katherine staring at him with rapturous adoration.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s familiar to those of us who follow the activities of <a href="/2020/01/duggar-women-accused-of-creepy-behavior-toward-husbands/">how women in fundamentalist cults stare at their husbands</a>, many were confused.</p>
<p>Staring lovingly at your spouse is normal. Staring at your spouse like he&#8217;s a beacon of holy light while he just looks into the camera is &#8230; weird. Even creepy.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Because of the strangeness of the photo and Chris&#8217; very timely unpopularity, the photo made the rounds.</p>
<p>More and more people read the caption below the photo.</p>
<p>This is when people went from &quot;haha that&#8217;s bizarre&quot; to being outright disgusted.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Guys. For real. Look how she&rsquo;s looking at me!&quot; Chris Pratt&#8217;s Instagram caption began.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean. Find you somebody that looks at you like that!! You know!?&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;We met in church. She&rsquo;s given me an amazing life, a gorgeous healthy daughter,&quot; Chris listed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chris then began the negging: &quot;She chews so loudly that sometimes i put in my ear buds to drown it out, but that&rsquo;s love!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She helps me with everything. In return, periodically, I open a jar of pickles,&quot; he quipped. &quot;That&rsquo;s the trade.&quot;</p>
<p>Like a Disney villain, Chris added: &quot;Her heart is pure and it belongs to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My greatest treasure right next to my Ken Griffey Jr Upper Deck Rookie card. Which if you know, you know is saying a lot,&quot; Chris continued.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s her birthday in about 6 weeks,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>&quot;So if I don&rsquo;t get her anything, I&rsquo;ll tell her to look back on this post,&quot; Chris concluded. &quot;Love you honey.&quot;</p>

<p>Some of that tongue-in-cheek weirdness rubbed people the wrong way, and understandably so.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, we might go &quot;wow, that&#8217;s not normal, but maybe they have that kind of relationship&quot; and maybe try for a <em>Schwarz-e-neg-her </em>joke.</p>
<p>But there was one detail of his post &#8212; part of the praise, actually &#8212; that had readers seeing red.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="806" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-806x1024.jpg" alt="Katherine Schwarzenegger Snapshot" class="wp-image-318995" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-236x300.jpg 236w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-768x976.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-1208x1536.jpg 1208w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-1611x2048.jpg 1611w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-735x934.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-264x335.jpg 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-273x347.jpg 273w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-409x520.jpg 409w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-503x640.jpg 503w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-604x768.jpg 604w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-755x960.jpg 755w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-850x1080.jpg 850w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/katherine-schwarzenegger-snapshot-scaled.jpg 2014w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Chris praised Katherine for the health of their daughter, Lyla.</p>
<p>Lyla is not Chris&#8217; first child. He has a son, Jack, with Anna Faris.</p>
<p>Jack was born nine weeks prematurely in 2012, weighing less than four pounds and having multiple health issues.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Normally, celebrating the birth of a healthy baby is not shady at all.</p>
<p>In this case, it seems that Chris was either being thoughtless or deliberately cruel &#8212; towards his ex and towards his son.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s infant health crisis was a defining element of Chris&#8217; increasingly devout Christian faith. Why would he be so insensitive?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>So the entire internet hit back, voicing their disgust.</p>
<p>Chris&#8217; name trended. Anna Faris&#8217; name trended, for the opposite reason, as people showered her with love and support.</p>
<p>Clearly, Chris saw all of that, because on Friday, he posted a video to his Instagram Stories that we have included in this post.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I went to bed last night really kind of upset and depressed,&quot; Chris said on Friday, November 5.</p>
<p>&quot;And I woke up feeling crappy,&quot; he lamented, &quot;and I didn&#8217;t want to work out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew though that if I put on my Christian music playlist and I got out of the woods and ran that I&#8217;d feel better,&quot; Chris continued.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;But I just didn&#8217;t want to,&quot; Chris explained.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it anyways, and gosh, I was right,&quot; he announced, &quot;it felt amazing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just want to say all glory to God,&quot; Chris then expressed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;And if you feel down today, maybe exercise or maybe listen to some good worship music or get the word in,&quot; Chris suggested.</p>
<p>He advised this &quot;because it really helped me this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>While we don&#8217;t doubt Chris&#8217; description of how he spent his morning &#8230; is that all that he was doing?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>First of all, it looked like an indirect response to the backlash against him, though he did not acknowledge any of it.</p>
<p>(And his weird creepy tribute is still up and unchanged)</p>
<p>Second, many have now accused him of trying to hide behind his faith by bringing it up in this context, as if his words should be above reproach.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Many <em>Parks and Recreation</em> fans have had a hard time reconciling the man whom Chris played (and even seemed to be in real life at the time) with who he is now.</p>
<p>Insulting your child, intentionally or by thoughtlessness, is not good. Using your religion to deflect criticism is unworthy.</p>
<p>Chris seems to be an enjoyable person to work with, according to other actors. That may be so. It does not make him a good person.</p>

<p>No one wants to believe that Chris is homophobic. People have loved him for a long time.</p>
<p>Now, he&#8217;s responding to her words, but his reply isn&#8217;t going over well with everyone. Take a look:</p>

</p>
<p>&quot;It has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which &#8216;hates a certain group of people,&#8217;&quot; Chris begins on his Instagram Story.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; he continues. &quot;Is &#8216;infamously anti &ndash;LGBTQ.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing could be further from the truth,&quot; Chris claims.</p>
<p>He then writes: &quot;I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>We hope that we do not have to explain that opening church doors is not the same thing as accepting or embracing the whole of a person.</p>
<p>But Chris had more to say. &#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Despite what the Bible says about divorce,&quot; Chris writes.</p>
<p>He continues: &quot;my church community was there for me every step of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>That note did not go over well on social media, but we&#8217;ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>Chris says that his church was &quot;never judging, just gracefully accompanying me on my walk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They helped me tremendously offering love and support,&quot; he notes.</p>
<p>&quot;It is what I have seen them do for others on countless occasions regardless of sexual orientation, race, or gender,&quot; Chris affirms.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;My faith is important to me,&quot; Chris writes.</p>
<p>That has always been very clear.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; he says. &quot;No church defines me or my life and I am not spokesman for any church or any group of people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My values define who I am,&quot; he affirms. &quot;We need less hate in this world, not more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a man who believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want free from the judgment of their fellow man,&quot; he concludes.</p>
<p>Hey, that sounds good!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-682x1024.jpg" alt="Chris Pratt Pose" class="wp-image-241454" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/chris-pratt-pose-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(2016 Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Chris then has a more explicitly religious message.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what guides me in my life,&quot; Chris says. &quot;He is a God of Love, Acceptance and Forgiveness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hate has no place in my or this world,&quot; he emphasizes.</p>
<p>He then quotes: &quot;Jesus said, &#8216;I give you a new command, love one another.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A quick note: divorce was very much a thing in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Specifically, biblically speaking, the Law of Moses absolutely allows for divorce under various circumstances.</p>
<p>It was in the New Testament that divorce became more frowned upon</p>
<p>Regardless, the vast majority of Christian communities are accepting of divorce as a part of life.</p>
<p>(Historically speaking, religions that do not adapt with the times face schisms or extinction)</p>
<p>Still, it rubbed many the wrong way that Chris seemed to compare accepting a divorced celebrity with accepting LGBTQ+ folks.</p>
<p>The latter are sometimes murdered simply for existing.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Still, though he could have spelled it out a bit more explicitly, it looks like Chris is affirming his support for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>He was trying to phrase things more broadly, but his meaning seems clear.</p>
<p>A lot of people understand that people may attend religious institutions with whom they do not agree on issues of human rights or politics.</p>
<p>At the same time &#8230; Chris did sound a little defensive of his church.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not the first celebrity with hordes of LGBTQ+ fans who has given people pause with his choice in which church to attend.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unreasonable for people to expect that his church affiliation reflects his values &#8212; or at least his priorities.</p>
<p>But we can all agree that Chris&#8217; response to this could have been much worse.</p>

</p>
<p>Ellen Page&#8217;s moving speech was delivered on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>.</p>
<p>Just as Ellen was praised for her words, Colbert was praised for giving her the time to speak up.</p>
<p>That was great!</p>
<p>But the very next night, Chris Pratt appeared on the show to promote the sequel to <em>The Lego Movie</em>.</p>
<p>He spoke about his faith-inspired diet. Chris is a Christian and attend Zoe Church.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. K. Um. But his church is infamously anti lgbtq,&quot; Ellen wrote, quote-tweeting Chris&#8217; appearance on the show.</p>
<p>&quot;So maybe address that too?&quot; she suggested.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Over the weekend, Ellen explained why she feels that it is so important to address this topic.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people,&quot; Ellen Page tweets.</p>
<p>She continues: &quot;don&rsquo;t be surprised if someone simply wonders why it&rsquo;s not addressed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Being anti LGBTQ is wrong,&quot; Ellen affirms. &quot;There aren&rsquo;t two sides.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, rather, there technically are <em>two sides</em> but one of them is bad. This is not like disagreeing about the colors of a dress.</p>
<p>&quot;The damage it causes is severe. Full stop,&quot; her tweet concludes. &quot;Sending love to all.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Why does it HAVE to be addressed??&quot; asked one tweeter.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can&rsquo;t people just respect his beliefs?&quot; that person asked. &quot;Are we really judging 1 Individual because of the company he keeps?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um. Yeah,&quot; Ellen replies, answering the first question. &quot;That&rsquo;s called complacency.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Ellen did not delve into the more complicated territory &#8212; such as where a view stops being a <em>belief </em>and becomes <em>bigotry</em>.</p>
<p>She also did not delve into the complicated question of how much a person&#8217;s choice in house of worship reflects their personal values.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Instead, she focused on a broader message, encouraging people to hear the thoughts of minorities instead of immediately getting defensive.</p>
<p>&quot;If lgbtq+ people are expressing their pain, their trauma, their experiences&#8230;maybe just try and listen?&quot; Ellen suggests.</p>
<p>&quot;Open your heart, stop being defensive, and have compassion,&quot; she implores them.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a beautiful and life changing feeling, empathy,&quot; she writes.</p>
<p>Ellen concludes: &quot;Much love truly to all.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Pastor Chad Veach has said that he founded Zoe Church by modeling it after Hillsong Church.</p>
<p>And Hillsong is very controversial.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not affirm a gay lifestyle,&quot; Hillsong senior pastor and founder Brian Houston has stated.</p>
<p>For the bajillionth time, we find ourselves asking what a gay <em>lifestyle</em>, or a <em>straight lifestyle</em>, means.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an odd euphemism.</p>
<p>&quot;And because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>&quot;I recognize this one statement alone is upsetting to people on both sides of this discussion,&quot; Houston continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Which points to the complexity of the issue for churches all over the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is welcome at Hillsong church,&quot; he affirmed.</p>
<p>He did add: &quot;except for known predators, those who are disruptive, or those who have adversarial agendas.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Known predators</em> should always be excluded, and we can understand why one would exclude disruptive guests.</p>
<p>The adversarial agendas line, however, sounds almost like something that you&#8217;d hear from the Church of Scientology.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Justin Bieber is a huge fan of Hillsong Church. So is Hailey Bieber.</p>
<p>And Kendall Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian and so many others.</p>
<p>The global megachurch, first founded in Australia, does not shy away from catering to celebrities.</p>
<p>But the massive religious entity is no stranger to scandal.</p>
<p>Ellen Page is far from the first to criticize the church and its founder.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For one thing, Brian Houston, who founded Hillsong Church, is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>In November of 2018, <em>60 Minutes Australia</em> reported that he remains under investigation for covering up his father&#8217;s repeated sexual abuse of children.</p>
<p>Hillsong has faced criticism for its involvement with a shady organization known as Mercy Ministries, which closed down in 2009.</p>
<p>The church has also been involved with a number of shady individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, former members of the church have described it as a shady institution with authoritarian leanings that frown upon independent thought.</p>
<p>(Some have said that, yeah, it&#8217;s a church, while others have argued that churches aren&#8217;t necessarily like this)</p>
<p>Notably, one former Hillsong member who is a vocal critic was arrested for trespassing while being interviewed outside of Hillsong.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Ellen Page isn&#8217;t going to war with Chris Pratt or with any church.</p>
<p>But her tweets are extremely fair.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with asking someone if an institution with which they have chosen to associate reflects their views and values.</p>
<p>We all <em>want to believe</em> that Chris Pratt is a good person who doesn&#8217;t have anything negative to say about the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>But wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to hear that from Chris himself? (And from the others who attend Zoe and Hillsong)</p>
<p>Depending upon his answer, we could all go back to enjoying him guilt-free.</p>

<p>Anna Faris has a podcast, because she&#8217;s a delight and fans love hearing from her.</p>
<p>On Monday, the same day that she posted her congratulatory message on social media, she spoke on the topic.</p>
<p>&quot;Chris texted me this morning,&quot; she revealed on <em>Anna Faris Unqualified</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Anna shared. &quot;He was like, &lsquo;I proposed to Katherine last night.&rsquo;&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge bombshell of a text for someone to send &#8212; and an even bigger deal to receive.</p>
<p>Anna included her own response: &quot;And I was like, &lsquo;Ahh, that&rsquo;s amazing.&rsquo;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;And I texted him back,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>Anna told him something &quot;like, &lsquo;I just wanted to remind you I&rsquo;m an ordained minister.&#8217; I&rsquo;m not very good at it &hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>A lighthearted joke is always a good way to show someone that their words don&#8217;t sting.</p>
<p>That said, we cannot actually imagine Anna Faris officiating Chris&#8217; next marriage.</p>
<p>For one thing, that would be incredibly awkward for literally everyone involved.</p>
<p>For another, we imagine that Chris and Katherine will want to form their own wedding plans.</p>

<p>Even so, Anna sounds as close ot over the moon as one can get for their ex moving on.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m so happy for them,&rdquo; Anna gushed on her podcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that it was gonna happen,&quot; she revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Anna said. &quot;I love her and I love him.&quot;</p>
<p>She wants the best for them both &quot;and I&rsquo;m just so happy that they found each other.&quot;</p>

<p>From day one of their split, Anna and Chris have made their priorities clear.</p>
<p>Their son, six-year-old Jack, comes first.</p>
<p>In that regard, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>But as Anna explains, Chris getting married again doesn&#8217;t make things worse for Jack.</p>
<p>Anna told her listeners: &quot;I so subscribe to the idea of, like, expanding, like, family and love with Jack.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;[Katherine&rsquo;s] awesome,&quot; Anna concluded.</p>

<p>This attitude was the same a year ago.</p>
<p>In January of 2018, Anna spoke on the topic of parenting (and co-parenting) despite their very public divorce.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it&rsquo;s just the general idea of just making sure that [Jack&rsquo;s] surrounded by a lot of love and happiness,&quot; Anna said at the time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good. Children are the first responsibility of any parent.</p>
<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re really good at that,&quot; she admitted. &quot;And we have amazing friends and incredible family.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Anna acknowledged. &quot;We have like just the most amazing resources to make sure that he feels safe and protected and happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Countless families lack the resources to give their child that level of security and comfort. It&#8217;s good that she is conscious of that.</p>
<p>&quot;And so far,&quot; she concluded. &quot;He is.&quot;</p>
