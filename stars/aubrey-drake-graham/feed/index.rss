<p>Besides plenty of hit songs, Drake has established himself as one of the wealthiest rappers in the game. Despite some feuds, Drake&#8217;s net worth is certainly not something to diss. </p>



<p>While most people think of Drake (whose real name is Aubrey Graham) for his countless hits, the rapper has been in the public eye for most of his life. </p>



<p>Drake began his career as an actor, and he&#8217;s still remembered by many <em>Degrassi </em>fans for his portrayal of Jimmy on the teen drama. In the late aughts, the actor made the transition to music, and he&#8217;s become a global superstar.</p>



<p>Since pivoting to music, many of his records have been regarded as classics, like <em>Thank Me Later </em>and <em>If You&#8217;re Reading This, It&#8217;s Too Late</em>. Throughout his career, Drake has broken and set streaming and <em>Billboard </em>records.</p>

<p>Despite having plenty of fans ready to listen to whatever he does, Drake has had his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-shooting-near-rappers-toronto-home-leaves-one-man-seriously-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share of public feuds</a> over the years. He&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/travis-scott-and-drake-sued-for-750-dollars-million-in-wake-of-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly sparred</a> with the likes of Meek Mill, Pusha T, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kanye-west-kris-jenner-had-sex-with-drake-and-i-can-prove-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West,</a> dropping diss tracks over the years.</p>



<p>Most recently, Drake faced off against Kendrick Lamar in 2024&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-to-kendrick-lamar-i-dont-have-a-secret-daughterm-but-your-wife-cheated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest celebrity feud.</a> Unfortunately for Drake, the public largely sided with the <em>GNX </em>rapper, and his diss &#8220;Not Like Us&#8221; was a song of the summer.</p>



<p>Despite taking a hit to his public image, Drake is certainly in a sound financial place. He&#8217;s still one of the highest-earning rappers and musical acts today. Find out more about Drake&#8217;s net worth here.</p>

<p>Drake is worth an estimated $250 million, according to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-rappers/drake-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Celebrity Net Worth</em>.</a> While most of Drake&#8217;s income comes from his music, he also has an estimated $400 million worldwide partnership with UMG. </p>



<p>Besides music, Drake has established himself as an actor, and he has returned to the world of television. He&#8217;s an executive producer on the hit HBO series <em>Euphoria</em> &#8212; which was the title of one of Kendrick&#8217;s diss tracks &#8212; as well as the British crime drama <em>Top Boy</em>.</p>



<p>Drake&#8217;s net worth has jumped up significantly in six years. His net worth was estimated to be at $150 million in June 2019, according <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/06/14/drake-net-worth-150-million-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a></em>. Now, in 2025, he&#8217;s valued at $100 million more than that.</p>

<p>Drake is definitely doing well for himself, but there are rappers that are still richer than him. A 2024 report listed Drake as the ninth richest rapper in the world, according to <em><a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/10-richest-rappers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High Snobiety.</a></em></p>



<p>The report ranked Drake higher than Snoop Dogg (only time you&#8217;ll hear that), Lil Wayne, and a few others. The top slots on the list were taken by Jay-Z, Diddy, and Dr. Dre. Drake&#8217;s other rival Kanye West ranked at four.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-drake-s-net-worth-higher-than-kendrick">Is Drake&#8217;s Net Worth Higher Than Kendrick?</h2>



<p>When making comparisons to other rappers, Drake is mostly now tied to Kendrick Lamar due to their intense rap battle against one another during the 2024 summer.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1153778013-1024x683.jpg" alt="Drake attends the LA Premiere Of HBO's &quot;Euphoria&quot; at The Cinerama Dome on June 04, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Kendrick took a shot on his verse in &#8220;Like That,&#8221; which led to an intense free-for-all between the two. Still, Drake got his share of barbs in with &#8220;Family Matters&#8221; and &#8220;Taylor Made Freestyle.&#8221; </p>



<p>While Drake and Kendrick&#8217;s feud has deep roots, many people sided with K.dot after his disses &#8220;Euphoria&#8221; and &#8220;Not Like Us&#8221; dropped. The latter racked up tons of airplay and streams.</p>



<p>Drake even filed a petition against Universal Music Group (his own label), alleging that they had artificially inflated streaming numbers for Kendrick&#8217;s diss track. Unfortunately, this move didn&#8217;t sway public respect. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/15/drake-files-federal-lawsuit-against-umg-over-kendrick-lamar-not-like-us-feud/">Drake has now filed a federal lawsuit against UMG</a>, alleging that the company pushed a &#8220;false and malicious narrative&#8221; through Kendrick&#8217;s diss tracks.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1235829116-780x1024.jpg" alt="Drake attends a preseason NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and the Houston Rockets at Scotiabank Arena on October 11, 2021 in Toronto, Canada.

<p>While the feud has mostly been dormant, Drake did most recently appear to address the hit to his public image on his track &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stl-R9m9T9Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fighting Irish Freestyle,</a>&#8221; which he quickly deleted from the producer&#8217;s YouTube page.</p>



<p>While Kendrick has been declared the winner in his feud with Drake, he&#8217;s actually not as wealthy as his foe. K.dot may have the Grammys and public acclaim, but Drizzy has the dollars.</p>



<p>Kendrick&#8217;s net worth falls over $100 million short of Drake&#8217;s. His net worth is an estimated $140 million, according to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-rappers/kendrick-lamar-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Celebrity Net Worth</em>. </a></p>

<p>And what does that have to do with Maria and her love life?</p>

<p>Well, one of the big revelations was that after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/devin-strader-bachelorette-spoilers-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devin Strader dumped Jenn</a>, he started following Maria on Instagram. Not cool, Devin!</p>



<p>Maria, as you might recall, was the eccentric Canadian who made it all the way to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-bachelor-spoilers-joey-graziadeis-winner-major-twist-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joey Graziadei&#8217;s final four</a>.</p>



<p>She was eventually eliminated, but she remained a fan favorite. And apparently, Devin was one of the viewers who was smitten.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-devin-situation">The Devin Situation</h2>



<p>&#8220;What I can&#8217;t understand is everything that you did after we&#8217;d broken our engagement,&#8221; Jenn said while confronting Devin on the live portion of this week&#8217;s show. </p>



<p>&#8220;Ending the engagement on a phone call, and the next day, I wake up to you following girls on Instagram — not just any girl, but Maria [Georgas]. Not only is that so disrespectful to everything that we had shared together, I just don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why you would do something like that?&#8221; she asked her ex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it completely invalidated our entire relationship, everything that I had felt for you, everything that we&#8217;d felt for each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously, I failed you,&#8221; Devin replied. &#8220;And there&#8217;s nothing I can say other than that. But, everything I felt for you was real.&#8221;</p>



<p>The situation made just about everyone dislike Devin (if they didn&#8217;t already). And it made <em>lots</em> of people wonder what Maria is up to these days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, with nearly 630,000 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maria.georgas/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> followers, she hasn&#8217;t exactly shied away from the spotlight. So wasn&#8217;t difficult to check in on Maria.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-maria-georgas-have-a-boyfriend">Does Maria Georgas Have a Boyfriend?</h2>



<p>In May, the 30-year-old appeared on the <a href="https://bachelornation.com/2024/05/02/maria-georgas-spills-the-tea-on-dating-one-of-drake-s-best-friends-drake-is-so-kind-and-sweet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Bachelor Happy Hour&#8221; podcast</a>, where she spoke with fellow franchise alum and Toronto resident Serena Pitt.</p>



<p>Serena asked about a rumor that her guest was dating a close friend of Drake&#8217;s. And Maria was quick to clarify the matter.</p>



<p>“We’re cool, so I don’t mind talking about this. He owned a restaurant with Drake in Toronto. Drake is a big thing in Toronto, obviously,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Maria went on to note that the friend of Drizzy&#8217;s is now her ex.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1319708929-1024x683.jpg" alt="Drake, winner of the Artist of the Decade Award, poses backstage for the 2021 Billboard Music Awards, broadcast on May 23, 2021 at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California.

<p>&#8220;It’s just not as crazy to think that there are ties to Drake in Toronto. Drake is the most amazing person. He is so kind and so sweet. My ex-boyfriend did have a restaurant with Drake,&#8221; she explained.</p>



<p>“That’s where that tie came in. I got to meet Drake and know him through my ex. They were running a restaurant together. It was a very popular restaurant at the time called Fring’s,&#8221; Maria added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now my other friend owns the new place. It’s called Marbl now. My friend Peter worked with Kaitlyn Bristowe, and Peter is literally the best. He owns that place now, but before that, it was called Fring’s.”</p>

<p>Who knew the Toronto restaurant scene was crawling with celebrities?</p>



<p>Of course, the more important takeaway here is that Maria is single.</p>



<p>So maybe she&#8217;s open to the possibility of Devin sliding into her DMs.</p>



<p>Of course, she&#8217;s probably aware that there&#8217;s no surer way to turn the denizens of Bachelor Nation against her!</p>

<p>Drake&#8217;s Toronto mansion was taped off by police last night following a shooting near the property.</p>

The 48-year-old is believed to be in stable condition.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/TPSOperations/status/1787801316678398461">tweet</a> from Toronto police, shots were fired around 2:10 a.m. ET near the corner of Bayview and Lawrence Avenues.</p>



<p>The suspect is believed to have fled in a car immediately after the shots were fired.</p>

<p>The officers who responded to the call discovered a seriously wounded man who was taken to a nearby hospital.</p>



<p>Thankfully, no one else was harmed. Drake was not injured, and it&#8217;s unclear if he was at home at the time of the shooting.</p>



<p>The security guard&#8217;s injuries have been described by <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/world-news/drakes-property-taped-off-by-police-after-shooting-in-area-leaves-man-with-serious-injuries/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=news_alert&amp;utm_content=20240507?&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=NYP%20-%20News%20Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em> as non-life-threatening.</p>

<p>Initially, it was hoped that the conflict that led to the shooting had nothing to do with Drake.</p>



<p>The cause of the dispute remains unclear, but it looks increasingly as though the rapper was being targeted.</p>



<p>Social media speculators are already jumping to the conclusion that the incident was related to the ongoing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-to-kendrick-lamar-i-dont-have-a-secret-daughterm-but-your-wife-cheated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar</a>.</p>



<p>The war of words between Drake and Kendrick is the most high-profile hip hop beef in recent memory.</p>

<p>Many have compared the situation to the deadly war between Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. that played out in the mid-nineties.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Kendrick released a scathing diss track titled &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221; The song featured an aerial photo of Drake&#8217;s home on its cover.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drake-vs-kendrick-lamar-feud-already-over-or-just-getting-started">Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar Feud: Already Over, or Just Getting Started?</h2>

<p>The bad blood between the rappers has been simmering at least since last year. It boiled over in a big way in recent weeks, with both artists releasing multiple diss tracks directed at one another.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; the latest from Kendrick, begins with the line &#8220;I see dead people&#8221; and contains ominous references to the ways in which Drake&#8217;s recent remarks have sparked outrage.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these are just lines in a song, and at present, there&#8217;s no reason to believe that last night&#8217;s shooting had anything to do with the feud between Kendrick and Drake.</p>

<p>According to the <em>Post</em>, Drake&#8217;s house is at the center of the investigation. But that does not mean that the rapper was being targeted.</p>



<p>That said, Drake and his loved ones are likely taking extra precautions today.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar beef has turned into the messiest hip-hop  feud in recent memory.</p>



<p>The diss tracks have been dropping at such a furious rate that it&#8217;s hard even for diehard fans to keep up with all the allegations!</p>



<p>And now, the situation has become even more complex, thanks to Drake&#8217;s claim that he set a trap for his rival &#8212; and Kendrick walked right into it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kendrick-lamar-claims-that-drake-has-a-secret-daughter">Kendrick Lamar Claims That Drake Has a Secret Daughter</h2>



<p>We won&#8217;t bother to rehash the entire feud. After all, this thing has more chapters than <em>Lord of the Rings</em> at this point.</p>



<p>Instead, we&#8217;ll fast forward to Drake&#8217;s latest release, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/05/05/drake-fed-kendrick-lamar-misinformation-denies-pedophile-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;The Heart Part 6,&#8221;</a> in which the Toronto-based rapper once again makes things very personal by commenting on Kendrick&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Of course, to be fair, Drizzy is responding to some shocking claims about his own personal life.</p>



<p>On &#8220;Meet the Grahams,&#8221; Kendrick addressed an entire verse to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/05/pusha-t-drake-is-a-deadbeat-dad-who-wears-blackface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake&#8217;s son, Adonis</a>, who was hidden from the public until 2018 when Pusha T accused his rival of &#8220;hiding a child&#8221; in his song &#8220;The Story of Adidon.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a separate verse on &#8220;Grahams,&#8221; Kendrick attempts a similar bombshell, claiming that Drake also has an 11-year-old daughter whom he&#8217;s been keeping under wraps.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="731" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1153778011-1024x731.jpg" alt="Drake attends the LA Premiere Of HBO's &quot;Euphoria&quot; at The Cinerama Dome on June 04, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drake-fires-back">Drake Fires Back</h2>



<p>Now, in his latest salvo, Drake claims that he used a fake mole to feed Kendrick false information about his non-existent daughter.</p>



<p>(We told you this situation is complex!)</p>



<p>He also claims that Kendrick dropped another diss track, &#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; in order to distract from the mistake he made on &#8220;Grahams.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The one before the last one, we finessed you into telling a story that doesn&#8217;t even exist,&#8221; Drake raps.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Things get uglier from there, as Drake repeats his allegation that Kendrick&#8217;s creative partner Dave Free is also father to one of the rapper&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why isn&#8217;t [Kendrick&#8217;s fiancee] Whitney [Alford] denying the allegations? Why is she following Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?&#8221; Drake raps.</p>



<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not the lesson, clearly there&#8217;s a deeper message,&#8221; he says at a different point in the song.</p>



<p>&#8220;Deep cuts that never healed, and now they got infected / Like if Dave really f&#8211;ked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin&#8217; resentment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needless to say, this situation has escalated yet again.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s only a matter of time before Kendrick fires back with yet another seven-minute epic.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a fun time to be a hip hop fan &#8212; but we do hope that the feud doesn&#8217;t get out of hand and that everyone will keep this thing on wax.</p>

<p><em>90 Day Fiance</em> superfans are real. And we&#8217;re not just talking about Ms. Kimberly.</p>



<p>Rihanna has DMed multiple cast members &#8212; from the worst to the best. Lady Gaga is a huge fan of the series, too.</p>



<p>Most don&#8217;t view the cast as a potential dating pool. For so, so many good reasons.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all heard that Drake may be an exception. And Chantel Everett has basically confirmed that he was trying to smash.</p>

<p>In a recent episode of <em>The Family Chantel</em>&#8216;s final season, the titular Chantel Everett discussed her divorce era. </p>



<p>And she touched upon the attention that&#8217;s come with it.</p>



<p>During the episode, Chantel admitted to the cameras that &#8220;a lot of great guys&#8221; had been messaging her.</p>

<p>In fact, Chantel also let it slip that one of the individuals in question was none other than a &#8220;Canadian rapper.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, Canada is home to tens of millions of people. Obviously, there are multiple rappers.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s only one who very famously slid into her DMs, according to reports from earlier this year. That would be Drake.</p>

<p>In the same episode, bitter ex-husband (even though he&#8217;s the one who wanted out of the marriage, he seems the angier of the two) mocked the rumors about Drake.</p>



<p>“I heard the rumor that Drake slipped into Chantel’s DM,” he taunted. </p>



<p>Pedro jeered: “Go with Drake, the famous rapper, you know? Go with him.”</p>

<p>Previously, Chantel had teased the idea &#8212; without naming names, or countries of origin &#8212; in interviews ahead of this season.</p>



<p>“I’ve had people sliding into my DMs, I’ve been talking to a couple of athletes, some actors, some rappers as well,” she said coyly at the time. </p>



<p>Chantel added: “Also, a lot of health care, doctors, like all kinds of people … So I’m enjoying this attention from men.”</p>

<p>Rumors surrounding Chantel and Drake actually began back in the summer of 2022. </p>



<p>At the time, their marriage&#8217;s ending was obviously a much newer matter.</p>



<p>Yet reports claimed that Drake, one of the most famous rappers on the planet, had been sliding into Chantel&#8217;s DMs almost from the moment that he heard about the breakup.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-1024x576.png" alt="Chantel Everett speaks firmly to the Season 5 confessional camera." class="wp-image-488319" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/1205_thefamilychantel_03_chanteleverett.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chantel Everett speaks firmly to the Season 5 confessional camera.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just to be clear, it&#8217;s not like Chantel opened her DMs one day to see a very famous dong pic.</p>



<p>She reportedly saw that he had reached out to her just to see how she was doing.</p>



<p>By all accounts, they never actually med up &#8230; but, allegedly, they did make tentative plans to. Things just never materialized for them.</p>

<p>Truth be told, it sounds like Drake may have done her a huge favor.</p>



<p>Pedro has seemingly been foaming at the mouth with unhappiness since these reports came out.</p>



<p>His repeated digs at Drake, who has never said a word to him, frankly seem <em>pathetic</em>. (And I say that as someone who is not a fan of Drake)</p>

<p>That said &#8230; some wonder if these rumors about Drake are manufactured.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that multiple outlets reported on them. And it does seem unlikely that Chantel would say &#8220;Canadian rapper&#8221; without there being <em>some </em>truth to it.</p>



<p>But it seems awfully convenient for any recent divorcee to have a famous guy blowing up their phone in a way that makes it look like they&#8217;re &#8220;winning&#8221; the divorce.</p>

<p>That said &#8230; Chantel does seem to be happier than Pedro. Albeit only a little bit. </p>



<p>As miserable and toxic as their marriage was, divorce is a miserable process.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re glad that their marital nightmare is over. Even though it was fun to watch, it just wasn&#8217;t good for anyone. Except, you know, for TLC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Kanye West has been off the rails like never before in recent weeks.</p>



<p>The rapper has a long, long history of public tantrums, and he often makes wildly inaccurate statements that have the potential to cause real harm.</p>



<p>This time, Ye has outdone himself with deeply upsetting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kanye-west-claims-kim-kardashian-is-a-racist-karen-spouts-anti-semitic-conspiracy-theories-in-anti-semitic-interview/">anti-semitic rants</a> and bizarre allegations about Kim Kardashian and her family.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, West appeared on the &#8220;Drink Champs&#8221; podcast, where he spewed more nonsense and raised more concerns about the state of his mental health.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Kanye West gave another bizarre interview this week. This time, he repeated a wild claim about Drake and Kris Jenner. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p> </p>



<p>At one point, Ye repeated one of the most bonkers claims of his career, alleging once again that his former mother-in-law Kris Jenner had an affair with Drake.</p>



<p>“DRAKE A F–K YA BABY MAMA’S MAMA,” West previously wrote on Instagram. “THAT’S REAL WAR.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not sure why Ye is concerned about who&#8217;s boning his baby mama&#8217;s mama, but the issue seems to be at the forefront of his mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>When &#8220;Drink Champs&#8221; host Nore referenced the bizarre claim, West appeared to confirm its accuracy.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that was hard,” he said, before referring to Drake as &#8220;the greatest rapper of all time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked for clarification, West kept it cryptic.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“You know what it mean. Ay, Corey, you know what it mean,” he said, seemingly referencing Kris&#8217; longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble.</p>



<p>At one point, Drake was one of the many, many people on Kanye&#8217;s lengthy list of enemies, but it seems the A-list emcees have settled their differences.</p>



<p>“EVERYONE KNOWS ME AND DRAKE HAVE HAD A RIVALRY IN THE PAST IT REALLY WARMED MY HEART TO SEE DRAKE LIKE ONE OF MY POST,” West wrote last week in his usual all-caps style.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Elsewhere on the podcast, Kanye sounded off on his favorite topic as of late, blathering on about wild global conspiracies that he says are orchestrated by Jewish people.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jewish people have owned the Black voice,&#8221; West said to the apparent confusion of his hosts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Either it’s through us wearing the Ralph Lauren shirt, or it’s all of us being signed to a record label, or having a Jewish manager, or being signed to a Jewish basketball team, or doing a movie on a Jewish platform like Disney,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Ye later alleged that people are &#8220;used to getting screwed by the Jewish media&#8221; and that they &#8220;poked the bear too f&#8212;ing long.&#8221;</p>



<p>The remarks echo similar vaguely threatening comments that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kanye-west-spews-nonsense-on-tucker-carlson-people-want-to-kill-me-because-i-love-trump/">West made during his interview with Tucker Carlson</a> earlier this month.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the rapper and fashion mogul has entered deeply disturbing territory.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In the past, West has been open about his struggles with bipolar disorder, explaining that the condition sometimes results in bouts of paranoia.</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on here.</p>



<p>If so, we hope that Kanye will soon receive the help that he needs &#8212; and in the meantime, we hope he&#8217;ll stop using his platform to endanger marginalized people.</p>

<p>Reports claim that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/chantel-everett-receiving-dms-from-drake-amidst-ugly-divorce-from-pedro-jimeno/">Drake has been sliding into Chantel Everett&#8217;s DMs</a> for most of the year.</p>



<p>Between her bitter divorce from Pedro Jimeno and Drake&#8217;s weirdness about Rihanna&#8217;s pregnancy, one can see it.</p>



<p>Fans <em>do </em>know Drake as a fan of <em>90 Day Fiance</em>. He has reached out to other cast members in the past.</p>



<p>But that mean that he&#8217;s actually barking up Chantel&#8217;s tree? What are his intentions?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1003" height="791" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great.png" alt="" class="wp-image-329837" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great.png 1003w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-300x237.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-768x606.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-735x580.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-335x264.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-347x274.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-520x410.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-640x505.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/05/chantel-everett-looks-great-960x757.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Chantel is not crazy about Pedro going to see his family in the Dominican Republic, and she makes it known that she, at the very least, wants him to stand up for her when they inevitably say negative things about her. Pedro is going away for a MONTH. Chantel has real fears that she could lose her marriage.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If the report is to be believed, Drake has been in contact with Chantel Everett since this spring.</p>



<p>That was the same time of year when <em>The Family Chantel</em> was filming. Her marriage was falling apart.</p>



<p>She was miserable. Pedro pushed for a separation. In May, Pedro filed for divorce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We are certain that Chantel wanted a sympathetic ear at this time.</p>



<p>Her friends and family would qualify &#8230; but even if they don&#8217;t say &#8220;told you so,&#8221; it might feel implied.</p>



<p>It is no secret that many in Chantel&#8217;s family have &#8230; <em>strong feelings</em> about Pedro.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="300" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/chantel-meets-shocky.gif" alt="Chantel Meets Shocky" class="wp-image-324693"/><figcaption>90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? star Chantel meets &#8220;shocky&#8221; at dinner with her family. Probably best that Pedro did not come along.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Drake is a famous rapper. He is lesser known for his history as an actor.</p>



<p>Many people would find it comforting, even flattering, to chat with someone of his level of fame.</p>



<p>That is true at any time &#8212; but especially for someone going through an ugly divorce, and in need of a distraction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="706" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-706x1024.jpg" alt="Drake in 2016" class="wp-image-301870" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-706x1024.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-768x1114.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-1059x1536.jpg 1059w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-1412x2048.jpg 1412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-735x1066.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-231x335.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-239x347.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-358x520.jpg 358w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-441x640.jpg 441w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-529x768.jpg 529w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-662x960.jpg 662w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-744x1080.jpg 744w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-scaled.jpg 1765w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Drake looks to be all business in this photo of the beloved artist. It was snapped of him back in 2016.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But &#8230; is it true? We have only one &#8220;real&#8221; report, and it&#8217;s not from <em>TMZ </em>or <em>People </em>or <em>Page Six</em>. Or even <em>Deuxmoi</em>. </p>



<p>Neither Chantel nor Drake have commented on this, so it&#8217;s not like one of them is making a claim &#8212; or denying it.</p>



<p>Chantel does follow Drake on Instagram. Interestingly, he does not appear to be following her back.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="758" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-1024x758.png" alt="Darcey Silva on Season 4" class="wp-image-339898" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-1024x758.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-300x222.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-768x569.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-735x544.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-335x248.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-347x257.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-520x385.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-640x474.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4-960x711.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/12/darcey-silva-on-season-4.png 1079w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(TLC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Publicly, Drake follows Darcey Silva on Instagram.</p>



<p>In the past, Caesar Mack described Drake reaching out to him after his time on the show.</p>



<p>We suppose that it&#8217;s <em>possible </em>for Caesar to have made that up &#8230; but why? If it were false, Drake has had year to deny it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>90 Day: The Single Life Season 3 will include Caesar Mack, who continues to thirst after Ukrainian women specifically. (Photo credit: Discovery Inc)</figcaption></figure>



<p>As for Drake&#8217;s intentions, the report claiming that these conversations are taking place covered that.</p>



<p>Allegedly, the conversations are friendly, and Chantel is interested in friendship at the most.</p>



<p>However, the same alleged insider close to Drake predicted that he will get a romantic or sexual relationship out of this eventually.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s a little creepy.</p>



<p>But then, Drake has a reputation for being more than a little creepy.</p>



<p>In fact, one of the most common jokes about these alleged DMs is questioning if Chantel (who is several years younger than Drake) is &#8220;too old&#8221; for him. Because she&#8217;s an adult.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Millie Bobbie Brown and Drake have a very close friendship. And millions of fans are profoundly creeped out by it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some have speculated that the DMs are really happening &#8230; but that it&#8217;s not Drake, but a catfish.</p>



<p>That sounds a little hard to believe.</p>



<p>To be clear, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine Caesar falling for a catfish (sorry, Caesar). It&#8217;s harder to see that from Chantel, especially over so many months.</p>

<p>As we previously noted, for now, we&#8217;re viewing this report with skepticism.</p>



<p>It is even possible, some fans speculate, that Chantel or a family member planted this rumor. For what reason? Who knows, honestly.</p>



<p>If Chantel or Drake weighs in, we&#8217;ll have stronger thoughts on the alleged DMs. One way or the other.</p>

<p><em>The Family Chantel</em> has barely scratched the surface on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/chantel-everett-and-pedro-jimeno-both-receive-restraining-orders-amidst-bitter-divorce/">Chantel Everett and Pedro Jimeno&#8217;s bitter divorce</a>.</p>



<p>The two separated this spring. Pedro filed for divorce, then Chantel filed her response.</p>



<p>Now, reports say that famous Canadian rapper Drake has been sliding into Chantel&#8217;s DMs since she and Pedro split.</p>



<p>Is that really happening? A lot of people feel surprised, especially since Chantel would be so <em>age-appropriate</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mediatakeout.com/drake-shoots-his-shot-at-reality-star-chantal-from-the-family-chantal/"><em>Media Take Out</em> reports</a> that Drake has been in Chantel&#8217;s DMs since this spring.</p>



<p>An inside source, allegedly an associate of Drake, shared: “Drake reached out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently this was &#8220;to see how she was doing and where her head was at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the insider continued, &#8220;she responded.”</p>



<p>“They’ve been DMing each other back and forth,&#8221; the insider detailed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the source teased, Chantel and Drake &#8220;are planning to meet up soon.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="659" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-1024x659.png" alt="Chantel Everett Has Her Suspicions" class="wp-image-332376" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-1024x659.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-300x193.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-768x494.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-735x473.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-335x216.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-347x223.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-520x335.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-640x412.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-960x618.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions-1080x695.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/07/chantel-everett-has-her-suspicions.png 1232w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? star Chantel Everett accuses her husband of traveling to the Dominican Republic in order to find another woman.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The report says that Chantel was not eager for a rebound after the end of her marriage, which spanned half a decade.</p>



<p>However, that attitude may soon change.</p>



<p>Or, rather, Drake may end up changing it, the report explains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Drake smiling with his Grammy for Best Rap Song on Sunday night in LA! </figcaption></figure>



<p>“Drake has a way of wearing women down,&#8221; the insider described.</p>



<p>&#8220;They might not at first expect any romance with Champagne Papi,&#8221; the source explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;But before long,&#8221; the insider insisted, &#8220;it always ends up that way.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We imagine that, even before the separation, Chantel could have used a &#8220;friend&#8221; as a welcome distraction.</p>



<p>The final months of their dying marriage were palpably miserable, full of fights, emotional isolation, and sadness.</p>



<p>It is easy to imagine Chantel responding favorably to some DMs from a celebrity, even a notorious one, as her life fell apart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>When it comes to timing, we should also consider where Drake&#8217;s head was early this year.</p>



<p>Rihanna announced her pregnancy to the world. As we all know, Drake has felt weirdly fixated on her, in ways that make her fans uncomfortable or even angry.</p>



<p>He unfollowed her on social media. Childish, we know, but it might make him more inclined to slide into someone&#8217;s DMs, you know?</p>

Are you a fan of the artist?</figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, we know that Drake is a <em>90 Day Fiance</em> fan.</p>



<p>If this story is legit, Chantel is not the first member of this franchise to be on the receiving end of a Drake DM or two.</p>



<p>But &#8230; is this true?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We could not help but notice that <em>Media Take Out</em>, the origin of the report, did not actually spell Chantel&#8217;s name correctly. Not even once.</p>



<p>Obviously, people make typos every day. And it&#8217;s very possible to be 100% right about someone without spelling their name correctly.</p>



<p>But &#8230; it&#8217;s fair to consider that a report may be off when the subject&#8217;s name has the wrong second vowel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>This was filmed last year, so an American woman spending time at a hotel at the DR doesn&#8217;t make us fear for her life like it might right now. Also, did you notice that she still has the &#8220;te quiero&#8221; balloon in her room that Pedro gave her at the airport? Awkward.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our official theory is that we&#8217;ll give this report more weight if and when Chantel confirms it.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not ruling it out. But we just don&#8217;t see any real evidence to substantiate the rumor. Not yet.</p>



<p>For now, we&#8217;re just watching this ugly divorce unfold.</p>

<p>Granted, Kanye is pretty much always angry, but these days he&#8217;s even more pissed off than usual.</p>
<p>And we probably don&#8217;t need to tell you what it is that&#8217;s got Yeezy so peeved.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/11/kim-kardashian-to-pete-davidson-lets-bone-after-paris-hiltons-we/">Kim Kardashian is dating Pete Davidson</a>, and West is not happy about it.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no real reason that Kanye should be upset regarding this relationship.</p>
<p>After all, Kim filed for divorce nearly a year ago, and <a href="/2022/01/kanye-west-and-julia-fox-dating/">Kanye is dating Julia Fox</a>.</p>
<p>But for reasons that must make sense in his own head, <a href="/2022/01/kanye-west-threatens-pete-davidson-in-new-song-im-gonna-beat-his/">West threatened to &quot;beat Pete Davidson&#8217;s ass&quot;</a> in a recent song.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>He followed that up by spreading a rumor that <a href="/2022/01/kanye-west-pete-davidson-has-aids-yall/">Davidson has AIDS</a>.</p>
<p>So why is this suddenly maniac acting so much crazier than usual?</p>
<p>Well, the obvious answers are that 1. Kanye is insane, and 2. he&#8217;s insanely possessive when it comes to Kim.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-819x1024.jpg" alt="Ye at a Fight" class="wp-image-412787" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-240x300.jpg 240w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-768x960.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-735x919.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-268x335.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-278x347.jpg 278w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-416x520.jpg 416w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-512x640.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-614x768.jpg 614w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-864x1080.jpg 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/ye-at-a-fight-scaled.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those are both valid explanations, but it&#8217;s possible that there&#8217;s more to going on here than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Maybe to fully understand the situation, we need to delve into the recent past of Kanye&#8217;s new boo.</p>
<p>We already reported on the rumor that<a href="/2022/01/pete-davidson-and-julia-fox-did-kim-and-kanyes-significant-other/"> Julia hooked up with Pete Davidson</a> when the two of them worked together on a photoshoot a couple of years ago.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Now, it looks as though Fox might have been romantically involved with another one of Kanye&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, the on and off <a href="/2018/12/kanye-west-reignites-feud-with-drake-for-dumbest-reason-ever/">feud between Kanye and Drake</a> has been raging for years.</p>
<p>At one point the situation got so bad that insiders claimed&nbsp;<a href="/2018/12/kim-kardashian-to-drake-leave-my-family-alone/">Kim threatened to leave Kanye</a>&nbsp;if didn&#8217;t make peace with his rival rapper.</p>

<p>Years later, Kim finally <em>did</em> file for divorce &#8212; for unrelated reasons, we&#8217;re sure &#8212; and Kanye and Drake patched things up long enough to perform at a concert together on December 9.</p>
<p>But Yeezy might be pissed at Drizzy all over again after learning that the Canadian crooner previously dated Julia.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/01/28/julia-fox-dated-drake-before-hooking-up-with-his-nemesis-kanye-west/">new report </a>from Page Six, Fox got in front of the situation by telling Kanye about the fling before he could read about it in the tabloids.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>She and West are still together, but knowing what we know about Kanye&#8217;s jealous streak, he&#8217;s probably not too happy about the situation.</p>
<p>Especially if he knows that Julia and Drake were hot and heavy right up until they were forced to part ways because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>According to insiders, Drake first reached out to Fox in 2019 to congratulate her on her work in the beloved Adam Sandler-Safdie brothers film <em>Uncut Gems</em>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>At the time, Fox was still in a relationship with&nbsp;Peter Artemiev, with whom she shares a 1-year-old son.</p>
<p>When Julia and Peter very publicly &#8212; and very messily &#8212; went their separate ways, Drake promptly swooped in, stopping by to see Julia while she was doing a paid appearance at Bloomingdale&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They closed down the store so he could visit,&rdquo; a source tells Page Six.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Drizzy reportedly showered Fox with presents during their time together, including two Birkin bags, which&nbsp;which generally cost between $20,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>Together they headed north of the border and played house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she went to [his hometown] Toronto to stay with him,&rdquo; says the insider.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="706" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-706x1024.jpg" alt="Drake in 2016" class="wp-image-301870" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-706x1024.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-768x1114.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-1059x1536.jpg 1059w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-1412x2048.jpg 1412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-735x1066.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-231x335.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-239x347.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-358x520.jpg 358w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-441x640.jpg 441w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-529x768.jpg 529w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-662x960.jpg 662w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-744x1080.jpg 744w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-scaled.jpg 1765w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Fox stayed at Drake&rsquo;s vast 50,000-square-foot mansion for several weeks until they were forced to part ways due to the outbreak of Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were closing the border [between Canada and the US], and she had to get back home,&rdquo; the source claims.</p>
<p>Fox later got back together with Artemiev and fell out of contact with Drake.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Then she met Kanye in Miami this past New Year&#8217;s Eve, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s genuinely no reason for Kanye to be upset over any of this.</p>
<p>But because he&#8217;s legitimately insane, you can be sure that he&#8217;s in the process of overreacting at this very moment.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself for an incoming diss track, Drizzy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Drake is something of a divisive figure.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s one of the most successful musical artists of the past 20 years in any genre, and yet, he&#8217;s also the subject of frequent, unflattering memes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sure he&#8217;s used to it by now, but the latest news about the Canadian crooner is sure to result in some of the most brutal roastings of his career.</p>
<p>Of course, if there&#8217;s any truth to this story, then Drizzy is no stranger to intense heat.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>According to a now-viral Instagram post, a model is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYhetbQvzBw/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=77198544-78e5-46c2-886a-34a0dd40f74c">planning to sue Drake</a> after a night of consensual intercourse took a bizarre turn after the springs stopped squeaking.</p>
<p>The post, which first appeared on the Too Much Tea Instagram page describes in detail how this random hookup got hot in all the wrong ways.</p>
<p>According to the anonymous model, she and Drake became acquainted on social media a few weeks ago, and they met up at a party shortly thereafter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="706" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-706x1024.jpg" alt="Drake in 2016" class="wp-image-301870" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-706x1024.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-768x1114.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-1059x1536.jpg 1059w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-1412x2048.jpg 1412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-735x1066.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-231x335.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-239x347.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-358x520.jpg 358w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-441x640.jpg 441w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-529x768.jpg 529w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-662x960.jpg 662w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-744x1080.jpg 744w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/drake-in-2016-scaled.jpg 1765w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before they headed back to his place and had sex, which she described in detail when talking to Too Much Tea:</p>
<p>&quot;She said he&#8217;s about 7 inches, thick, and cut. They f-cked for about 20 minutes. He mostly hit it from the back and eventually came inside the condom,&quot; Too Much Tea writes.</p>
<p>&quot;Immediately after, he went back into the bathroom to dispose of it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-683x1024.jpg" alt="Drake at Film Festival" class="wp-image-299175" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/drake-at-film-festival-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>At that point, the model went into the bathroom herself, untied the condom, and attempted to impregnate herself with Drake&#8217;s sperm.</p>
<p>She was in for a rather spicy surprise, however, as it seems the rapper had filled the condom with hot sauce in order to safeguard against this very chicanery.</p>
<p>&quot;She said it felt like pouring hot lava into her p-ssy,&quot; Too Much Tea writes, essentially shutting down the contest for &quot;funniest journalistic sentence of 2022&quot; in early January.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;She screamed, and Drake ran into the bathroom. He admitted that he poured a packet of hot sauce in the condom to kill the sperm,&quot; the outlet continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Instagram model is threatening to sue Drake.&quot;</p>
<p>Drake hasn&#8217;t responded to the model&#8217;s claims directly, but some fans think he threw a bit of <em>mild</em> shade her way with his most recent Instagram post:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;You can have your 15 minutes of fame&hellip;I&rsquo;ll take the other 23 hours and 45 mins,&rdquo; he captioned the photo above.</p>
<p>But as much as Drizzy might want this story to simply go away, the internet, as you might have guessed, is having a field day with it.</p>
<p>The memes have been coming in hot (pun fully intended) ever since this story broke, and they probably won&#8217;t be slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>After all, Drake has always been one of our culture&#8217;s most meme-able figures.</p>
<p>And this is a story about hot sauce and genitals that sounds like something out of an <em>American Pie</em> movie.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a match made in heaven.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And if the <a href="/videos/drakes-mom-forgets-his-sandwich/">Drake tuna sandwich video</a> is any indication, the internet goes wild for any content involving Champagne Papi and food.</p>
<p>Besides, while this story probably isn&#8217;t particularly high-larious for the model who burned her hot pocket, it&#8217;s a welcome change of pace from the more serious stories about Toronto&#8217;s favorite son.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="/2021/11/travis-scott-and-drake-sued-for-750-dollars-million-in-wake-of-a/">Drake is being sued for $750 million</a> for his involvement in the tragedy at Travis Scott&#8217;s Astroworld music festival.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="914" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-914x1024.jpg" alt="Drake in a Vest" class="wp-image-262131" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-914x1024.jpg 914w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-268x300.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-768x861.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-1371x1536.jpg 1371w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-735x824.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-299x335.jpg 299w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-310x347.jpg 310w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-464x520.jpg 464w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-571x640.jpg 571w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-685x768.jpg 685w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-857x960.jpg 857w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest-964x1080.jpg 964w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/drake-in-a-vest.jpg 1700w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The rapper had nothing to do with planning or organizing the event, so the case will probably be thrown out of court.</p>
<p>Still, he&#8217;s probably happy to see Twitter obsessing over a much more frivolous lawsuit.</p>
<p>Hopefully, he&#8217;ll address this matter directly and let the world know if he&#8217;s a Frank&#8217;s or Tabasco guy.</p>
