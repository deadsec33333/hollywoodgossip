<p>Taylor Swift absolutely crushed it in 2024 — but Beyonce recently claimed a major victory over the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/taylor-swift-brother-austin-fan-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eras Tour</a> icon!</p>



<p>As you may have heard, <em>Billboard</em> has named Bey the top pop star of the 21st century.</p>



<p>And <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/julia-roberts-travis-kelce-swifties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor&#8217;s famously loyal legion of fans</a> are not thrilled with the decision.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-fans-object-to-beyonce-s-latest-achievement">Taylor Swift Fans Object to Beyonce&#8217;s Latest Achievement</h2>



<p>The <em>Billboard</em> list came out gradually over several weeks, so fans knew for a while that Taylor wouldn&#8217;t rise any higher than the number two spot.</p>



<p>Still, when Bey was revealed as the century&#8217;s most dominant pop star, Swifties reacted with outrage.</p>



<p>“Taylor had more impact in the last 5 years than Beyoncé in her whole career ×5,” one Swiftie tweeted, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/03/entertainment/taylor-swift-fans-locked-in-heated-disputes-as-beyonce-is-named-billboards-greatest-pop-star-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166913977-1-1024x683.jpg" alt='Taylor Swift performs on stage during the "Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour" at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024 in London, England.

<p>“In other words, because Taylor was 15, Beyoncé had the advantage.. what type of publication is this?&#8221; another asked.</p>



<p>“Influence, evolution, and impact are all 3 words that describe Taylor, btw!” a third chimed in, referring to the publication&#8217;s criteria.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-s-reaction">Taylor&#8217;s Reaction</h2>



<p>And how did Taylor respond to the news that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/beyonce-greatest-pop-stars-21st-century-1235842572/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bey was crowned Queen of the Century</a>?</p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/03/celebrity-news/how-taylor-swift-reacted-to-beyonce-being-named-greatest-pop-star-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a source</a> tells Page Six that she&#8217;s &#8220;really happy for Beyonce” and completely unbothered by the fact that she didn&#8217;t win the title herself.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="738" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-738x1024.jpg" alt="BeyoncÃ© accepts the Innovator Award onstage during the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 01, 2024." class="wp-image-514371" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-738x1024.jpg 738w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-216x300.jpg 216w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-768x1066.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-1475x2048.jpg 1475w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-692x960.jpg 692w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-778x1080.jpg 778w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-864x1200.jpg 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131560015-scaled.jpg 1844w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BeyoncÃ© accepts the Innovator Award onstage during the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 01, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartRadio)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Taylor will always support strong female artists and thinks Beyoncé is so deserving of this honor,” said the insider.</p>



<p>No surprise there. While a case could certainly be made for Taylor being the century&#8217;s top pop star, we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s well aware of the enormous impact of Beyonce&#8217;s career.</p>



<p>And the title comes after a year in which Bey shattered even more records and barriers with her <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Carter</a></em> album.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="740" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2131542235-1-1024x740.jpg" alt="BeyoncÃ© accepts the Innovator Award onstage during the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 01, 2024.

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that the <em>Billboard</em> rankings have created controversy. </p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/hailey-bieber/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailey Bieber</a> vented her outrage when Justin came in at number eight on the list.</p>



<p>But ultimately, this seems like the sort of situation that fans care more about than artists.</p>



<p>Some Swifties will probably remain angry over this mild snub, but hey, it&#8217;s not all bad news for Taylor:</p>

<p>She was also named<a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/04/entertainment/taylor-swift-named-spotifys-most-streamed-artist-for-2024-with-over-26-billion-streams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify&#8217;s most-streamed artist</a> of 2024!</p>



<p>Oh, and she&#8217;s fabulously wealthy and arguably the most famous person on the planet.</p>



<p>So yeah, she&#8217;s probably not losing much sleep over the whole <em>Billboard</em> thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 7</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Beyonce is nominated for multiple Grammys in 2025, but historically, she&#8217;s been shut out from the top awards on multiple occasions. </p>



<p>Her newest album <em>Cowboy Carter </em>is nominated for Album of the Year, but that is one Grammy she has never won. While fans are rooting for her, it&#8217;s more than likely that she&#8217;ll miss out again.</p>



<p>Understand, this is not a criticism. However, in the past, Beyonce has been favored to win Album of the Year at the Grammys multiple times, but she&#8217;s always come up short when the final award gets handed out. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1024x695.jpg" alt="Beyonce on October 25, 2024 while campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris." class="wp-image-512650" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1080x733.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1200x814.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BeyoncÃ© looks on during a campaign rally with Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, at Shell Energy Stadium on October 25, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In our humble opinion, <em>Cowboy Carter </em>is certainly deserving of the prize, but there&#8217;s definitely no saying whether she&#8217;ll get the award. And as we&#8217;ve learned time and time again this year, history has a way of repeating itself.</p>



<p>Besides, even though Bey is nominated in a bunch of categories (including Album of the Year), she does have some stiff competition, going up against rising popstars like Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, and Charli XCX.  Past Album of the Year winners Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish are also nominated this year, and honestly, it&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-grammys-does-beyonce-have">How Many Grammys Does Beyonce Have?</h2>



<p>Queen B is the artist to win the most Grammy Awards ever, which should come as no surprise. She&#8217;s also the most nominated artist of all time. She shares that honor with her husband, Jay-Z.</p>



<p>Beyonce has won 32 Grammys throughout her career. As of 2025, she has been nominated 88 times, which is definitely no small feat!</p>

<p>The &#8220;Crazy In Love&#8221; singer received her first solo nominations in 2004. She has been nominated as a member of Destiny&#8217;s Child and for her collab album with Jay-Z as The Carters.</p>



<p>Beyonce has been nominated in the general field many times, but she has only won Song of the Year once. Her only win came in 2010 for the megahit &#8220;Single Ladies.&#8221;</p>



<p>Next year, Beyonce has the opportunity to expand her lead as the most-honored Grammy winner in history. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-1-country-song-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Her album <em>Cowboy Carter</em></a> has a whopping 11 nominations for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, making her the most nominated artist this year.</p>



<p>Despite winning many Grammys, Beyonce has been shut out for many of the Recording Academy&#8217;s General Field awards. And that&#8217;s not the only time she&#8217;s felt that burn. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-s-cma-shutout">Beyonce&#8217;s CMA Shutout</h2>



<p>One of the most glaring snubs for Bey actually came in September 2024. When the Country Music Awards announced their nominees, <em>Cowboy Carter </em>was noticeably absent.</p>



<p>Even though Beyonce has never been nominated for a CMA before, many people were surprised to see arguably the most famous singer in the world shutout, because <em>Cowboy Carter </em>is a country album.</p>



<p>The CMAs have not explained exactly why they snubbed <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, but <em>Vox </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/370704/beyonce-cowboy-carter-cma-country-music-awards-snub-what-happened-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that perhaps a lack of promotion or the fact that the award show favors male pop crossovers may have been why. </p>

<p>Despite the clear country influences, Beyonce may have hurt her standing in the country world when she announced the album. &#8220;This ain’t a Country album. This is a &#8216;Beyoncé&#8217; album,&#8221; she wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beyonce/p/C4s6Zr7rlwA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>Even though the CMAs didn&#8217;t explain <em>Cowboy Carter&#8217;s </em>omission, a few country stars have offered their opinions on why Beyonce didn&#8217;t get a nomination. Some of them suggested that Beyonce isn&#8217;t in the country world enough to get the recognition.</p>



<p>Luke Bryan noted that the &#8220;Halo&#8221; singer hasn&#8217;t been part of the country &#8220;family,&#8221; which may have been why she got left out. He explained his thought during an <a href="https://youtu.be/pspALWzUpQI?si=56lb7WH_MfmH1sh7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> on <em>Andy Cohen Live</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you’re gonna make country albums, come into our world and be country with us a little bit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come to an award show and high-five us and have fun and get in the family, too. And I’m not saying she didn’t do that … but country music is a lot about family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dolly Parton, who is featured on the album, also shared her thoughts on the controversy in a <em>Variety </em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dolly-parton-beyonce-taylor-swift-1236147283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>. &#8220;There’s so many wonderful country artists that, I guess probably the country music field, they probably thought, well, we can’t really leave out some of the ones that spend their whole life doing that,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The lack of CMA nominations clearly didn&#8217;t affect <em>Cowboy Carter&#8217;s </em>run for the Grammys, because she was nominated in multiple country music categories, including Best Country Album.</p>



<p>That being said, it&#8217;s still not clear if Beyonce will win in any of the country categories, because she&#8217;s up against a few artists who are more firmly in the country world, like Chris Stapleton, Lainey Wilson, and Kacey Musgraves. Her <em>Cowboy Carter </em>collaborators Post Malone and Shaboozey are also nominated against her, and they did receive CMA nominations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-s-biggest-snubs">Beyonce&#8217;s Biggest Snubs</h2>



<p>Even though she hasn&#8217;t won many awards in the General Field, Beyonce has popped up as a nominee countless times. In more recent years, there&#8217;s been outrage over Bey&#8217;s losses in those categories.</p>



<p>One of Beyonce&#8217;s first major losses was in 2015. She lost the Album of the Year award for her self-titled album to Beck&#8217;s <em>Morning Phase.</em> Still, she gracefully accepted the loss, but the same couldn&#8217;t be said for everyone.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After Beck won, Kanye West <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jEpVCGqSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged the stage,</a> seemingly in a repeat from his 2009 VMAs incident. After getting on stage, Ye smiled and headed back into the audience. He didn&#8217;t escalate the situation any further.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Beck seemed to take it in good fun. He even gestured for Kanye to come back on stage, but the rapper didn&#8217;t take him up on the offer.</p>



<p>After the show, Kanye explained his thoughts in an <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/623519/kanye-west-goes-off-on-beck-s-grammy-win-he-should-have-given-his-award-to-beyonce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with <em>E! News</em>. &#8220;Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyonce,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Another major loss came in 2017. Beyonce&#8217;s album <em>Lemonade</em> was a critical hit. The album topped many outlets&#8217; year-end lists. The record was definitely favored to come out on top at the Grammys.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Adele won for her album <em>25. </em>As she accepted the award, the &#8220;Someone Like You&#8221; singer showed that she thought Beyonce should&#8217;ve won.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>During her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuggqUSITM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Adele showed plenty of love for Queen B. &#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly accept this award,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very humble, and I&#8217;m very grateful and gracious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My artist of my life is Beyonce, and this album to me, the <em>Lemonade</em> album, is just so monumental,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All us artists here, we f**king adore you. You are our light.&#8221;</p>



<p> After her speech, Adele broke her Grammy to share in the glory with Beyonce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jay-z-speaks-out-against-the-grammys">Jay-Z Speaks Out Against The Grammys</h2>



<p>In 2024, Beyonce&#8217;s husband Jay-Z received the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the Grammys. After showing thanks, the rapper took a shot at the Recording Academy during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6dBQ2UM6JI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>After speaking about instances where rappers boycotted the Grammys, Jay called out the establishment. &#8220;We want y&#8217;all to get it right. We love y&#8217;all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s subjective. It&#8217;s music, and it&#8217;s opinion-based.&#8221;</p>



<p>As he continued, Jay spoke about Beyonce. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year. So, even by your own metrics that doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p> &#8220;Think about that: most Grammys, never won Album of the Year. It doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-s-response-to-her-snubs">Beyonce&#8217;s Response to Her Snubs</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="733" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-1024x733.jpg" alt="BeyoncÃ© accepts the Best R&amp;B Performance award for 'Black Parade' onstage during the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-497930" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-300x215.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-768x549.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-2048x1465.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-960x687.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-1080x773.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1307117263-1-1200x859.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BeyoncÃ© accepts the Best R&amp;B Performance award for &#8216;Black Parade&#8217; onstage during the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Los Angeles Convention Center on March 14, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Beyonce has mostly let her snubs roll off her back. That being said, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonces-cowboy-carter-album-cameos-from-dolly-parton-rumi-carter-leave-fans-reeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her album <em>Cowboy Carter</em></a><em> </em>responds to some of her past snubs.</p>



<p>In the opening song &#8220;American Requiem,&#8221; Beyonce claps back at critics. &#8220;Used to say I spoke too country/And the rejection came, said I wasn&#8217;t country enough,&#8221; she sings.</p>



<p>The line <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/luke-bryan-beyonce-diss-beyhive-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">references the backlash </a>that Beyonce received for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/beyonce-snubbed-by-country-music-awards-beyhive-vows-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performing at the CMA Awards</a> in 2016 with The Chicks. Following the performance, some fans spoke out against Bey&#8217;s inclusion in the award show.</p>



<p>The line also seems to clap back at the Grammys. The Academy rejected her song &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s Home&#8221; from the country categories. After her CMA snubs, the line feels even more fitting on the album. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-awards-is-she-nominated-for-this-year">What Awards Is She Nominated For This Year?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, Beyonce is up for 11 awards at the 2025 Grammys. If she wins any, she&#8217;ll greatly expand her lead as the most awarded artist.</p>



<p>All three of the major categories have Beyonce nominations. She&#8217;s up for Album of the Year for <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, while &#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em&#8221; is up for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year.</p>



<p>Besides those two, Beyonce is up for the following awards: Best Country Album (<em>Cowboy Carter</em>), Best Country Song (&#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em&#8221;), Best Pop Solo Performance (&#8220;Bodyguard&#8221;), Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (&#8220;Levii&#8217;s Jeans&#8221;), <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/shaboozey-who-is-the-hip-hop-country-artist-featured-on-beyonces-cowboy-carter-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Melodic Rap Performance (&#8220;Spaghettii</a>&#8220;), Best Country Solo Performance (&#8220;16 Carriages&#8221;), Best Country Duo/Group Performance (&#8220;II Most Wanted&#8221;), and Best Americana Performance (&#8220;Ya Ya&#8221;). </p>



<p>This year, the Beyhive is definitely rooting for her in every category!</p>

<p>As you likely know at this point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> shattered the record for highest-grossing concert tour last year.</p>



<p>Already, however, we have two questions to ask:</p>



<p><strong>For how long will this record stand? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Is Beyonce about to break it?</strong></p>

<p>At midnight on Sunday, the artist announced that she is embarking on her Cowboy Carter Tour &#8230; following the release of her eponymous country-themed album.</p>



<p>The confirmation came ahead of this evening&#8217;s Grammy Awards and in the wake of the &#8220;Beyoncé Bowl&#8221; special on Netflix having been released, which now reads &#8220;Cowboy Carter Tour&#8221; at the end.</p>



<p>In a video uploaded to Beyoncé&#8217;s Instagram revealing the news, a sign hanging over a desert floor in the night sky lights up repeatedly with the words <em><strong>COWBOY CARTER TOUR</strong></em> in big bright block letters &#8212; as an electrical hum and wind is heard in the background.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear when Beyoncé will release more details regarding the tour such as dates, locations and when tickets will go on sale.</p>



<p>For now, all we know is that it&#8217;s <em>happening</em>.</p>



<p>At some point. At a whole bunch of locations.</p>



<p>This Beyonce tour bombshell has gone viral just over a month since the star&#8217;s Christmas Day halftime performance during an NFL game that streamed on Netflix. </p>



<p>The show served as a homecoming for the Houston native where she performed tracks from Cowboy Carter for the first time since its release in March 2024.</p>

<p>Following her performance in December, the 43-year old dropped a 15-second video that cut to black with the date 1.14.25 and the caption, &#8220;Look at that horse,&#8221; referring to her song &#8220;Sweet Honey Buckiin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, that date took place in the middle of Los Angeles wildfires that claimed thousands of homes and many lives in the area.</p>



<p>&#8220;I continue to pray for healing and rebuilding for the families suffering from trauma and loss,&#8221; Beyonce wrote on Instagram back then. &#8220;We are so blessed to have brave first responders who continue to work tirelessly to protect the Los Angeles community.&#8221;</p>



<p>The beloved singer has also donated $2.5 million to Los Angeles relief funds through her BeyGood Foundation.</p>

<p>Tina Knowles is clearing the air after her followers spotted some very surprising activity on her Instagram account.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, Tina&#8217;s son-in-law, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/jay-z-accused-of-teaming-with-diddy-to-rape-13-year-old-rapper-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Z, has been accused of raping a 13-year-old girl</a>.</p>



<p>In a lawsuit filed over the weekend, the anonymous plaintiff claims that she was sexually assaulted by Jay, Diddy, and an unnamed female celebrity at a party that followed the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jay-z-attempts-to-rescue-reputation">Jay Z Attempts to Rescue Reputation</h2>



<p>On Monday, Jay, Tina, and Beyonce <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/jay-z-supports-blue-ivy-at-mufasa-premiere-amid-rape-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported Blue Ivy at the premiere of <em>The Lion King: Mufasa</em></a>, in which she and Bey both voice characters.</p>



<p>The move came as a surprise to many fans, as the Carters generally avoid red carpets.</p>



<p>But Jay might have been feeling the need for some positive press amid this week&#8217;s allegations. And Tina might have felt the need to prove to the public that she still supports her son.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tina-s-alleged-instagram-shade">Tina&#8217;s Alleged Instagram Shade</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Instagram users noted that Tina&#8217;s account &#8220;liked&#8221; a post about Jay being accused of rape.</p>



<p>The post in question linked to an ABC7 Chicago article describing the suit, in which Jay and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-bail-request-denied-judge-deems-rapper-a-violent-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy, who is currently behind bars awaiting trial</a>, are accused of rape.</p>



<p>Tina has since denied that she &#8220;liked&#8221; the post, claiming instead that she was hacked.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="713" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-713x1024.jpg" alt="Beyonce and her mom Tina Knowles attend the world premiere of Disney's &quot;Mufasa: The Lion King&quot; at the Dolby theater in Hollywood, California, December 9, 2024." class="wp-image-514936" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-713x1024.jpg 713w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-209x300.jpg 209w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-768x1103.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-1426x2048.jpg 1426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-668x960.jpg 668w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-752x1080.jpg 752w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-835x1200.jpg 835w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2188545167-1-scaled.jpg 1782w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Beyonce and her mom Tina Knowles attend the world premiere of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Mufasa: The Lion King&#8221; at the Dolby theater in Hollywood, California, December 9, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by LISA O&#8217;CONNOR/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;As you all know I do not play about my family. So if you see something uncharacteristic of me. Just know that it is not me!&#8221; Tina wrote on Instagram, according to <a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/beyonce-mom-tina-knowles-likes-post-jay-z-rape-lawsuit-sean-diddy-combs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>OK! </em>magazine</a>.</p>



<p>The Knowles and Carter families have mostly remained quiet in the wake of the allegations.</p>



<p>But shortly after news of the lawsuit went public, Jay issued a statement in which he denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jay-issues-a-statement">Jay Issues a Statement</h2>



<p>&#8220;My only heartbreak is for my family. My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people,&#8221; the statement read. </p>



<p>&#8220;I mourn yet another loss of innocence.&#8221;</p>



<p>The hip hop legend has vowed to fight the allegations against him and work to restore his good name.</p>

<p>Fans are divided on Jay&#8217;s decision to attend last night&#8217;s red carpet, with some praising the display of family unity and others accusing the rapper of <a href="https://x.com/YSLONIKA/status/1866372383088533517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoiling his daughter&#8217;s big night</a>.</p>



<p>Whatever the reasoning behind the decision, there are likely some tough months ahead for the Carter family.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>The hip hop legend has denied the allegations and vowed that he will fight to protect his good name.</p>



<p>Eventually, Jay might have to defend himself in court. In the meantime, he&#8217;s attempting to maintain a sense of normalcy by supporting daughter Blue Ivy in her latest career endeavor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jay-z-beyonce-make-rare-red-carpet-appearance-in-support-of-blue-ivy">Jay Z, Beyonce Make Rare Red Carpet Appearance In Support of Blue Ivy</h2>



<p>Blue Ivy voices Kiara, the daughter of Simba and Nala, in the upcoming <em>Lion King</em> prequel, <em>Mufasa</em>.</p>



<p>The film had its Los Angeles premiere at the Dolby Theater last night, and to the surprise of many Jay, wife Beyonce, and her mother, Tina Knowles, were all in attendance.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jay-z-walks-red-carpet-with-beyonce-blue-ivy-amid-rape-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>, the Carters were not listed as guests ahead of the event, and Beyonce usually avoids red carpet scenarios.</p>

<p>According to <em>USA Today</em>, Beyonce joined her daughter on stage before the start of the film, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/12/09/jay-z-beyonce-attend-mufasa-premiere-amid-lawsuit/76866494007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Carters quietly exited the event </a>shortly thereafter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shocking-allegations">The Shocking Allegations</h2>



<p>The woman who filed a lawsuit earlier this week claims that Jay, Diddy, and an unnamed female celebrity raped her at a VMAs afterparty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-bail-request-denied-judge-deems-rapper-a-violent-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is currently in jail</a>, awaiting trial on numerous sexual abuse allegations.</p>



<p>Jay&#8217;s team immediately issued a statement denying any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>“My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people,” Jay-Z’s statement read. </p>



<p>“I mourn yet another loss of innocence. Children should not have to endure such at their young age. It is unfair to have to try to understand inexplicable degrees of malice meant to destroy families and human spirit.”</p>



<p>Jay&#8217;s attendance at last night&#8217;s premiere received a mixed response from the public, with some social media commenters blasting it as a cynical PR stunt.</p>

<p>“Jay said they said I rapped [sic] a kid, everybody get dressed we going to see Mufasa LOL,&#8221; 50 Cent wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post, according to <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/entertainment/50-cent-reacts-to-jay-z-at-mufasa-premiere-after-rape-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>Jay did not speak with the media during the premiere, and he&#8217;ll likely remain tight-lipped in the weeks to come.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Luke Bryan made the unfortunate decision to diss Beyonce. Now, he must face the wrath of both the Beyhive and American Idol producers. </p>



<p>As you&#8217;re likely aware, Beyonce released her first country album, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonces-cowboy-carter-album-cameos-from-dolly-parton-rumi-carter-leave-fans-reeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Carter</a></em>, earlier this year.</p>



<p>While the initial response from fans was predictably ecstatic, the album failed to make as big a splash with critics and industry insiders.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="740" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2131542235-1024x740.jpg" alt="BeyoncÃ© accepts the Innovator Award onstage during the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 01, 2024.

<p>And the Beyonce faithful were shocked last month when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/beyonce-snubbed-by-country-music-awards-beyhive-vows-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cowboy Carter</em> didn&#8217;t receive a single Country Music Award nomination</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Luke is speculating on what might have happened there. But it seems that instead of calming anyone down, he&#8217;s only managed to further rile up the Beyhive. He&#8217;s also put at risk the network&#8217;s relationship with Queen B, which is making zero people happy. </p>

<p>“Everybody loved that Beyonce made a country album. Nobody’s mad about it,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/luke-bryan-leaving-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>American Idol</em> judge</a> said during a recent interview on Andy Cohen&#8217;s radio show.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where things get a little tricky … if you’re gonna make country albums, come into our world and be country with us a little bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Luke proceeded to clarify that he&#8217;s a fan of Bey&#8217;s work. But he feels that she failed to play the industry politics game in the months after her album dropped.</p>



<p>“Beyonce can do exactly what she wants to. She’s probably the biggest star in music,” he said.</p>

<p>“But come to an award show and high-five us, and have fun and get in the family, too. And I’m not saying she didn’t do that. … But country music’s a lot about family,&#8221; Luke continued.</p>



<p>“I’m all for everybody coming in and making country albums and all that. But just by declaring that, just because she made one — just ’cause I make one, I don’t get any nominations.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-backlash">The Backlash</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely guessed, these comments didn&#8217;t go over super well with anyone who calls themselves a Bey fan. </p>



<p>Plus, it really didn&#8217;t go well with Luke&#8217;s bosses over at <em>American Idol</em>. The show the last few years has been lacking in star power and with Katy Perry&#8217;s exit, producers were hoping they could boost ratings by inviting big names to mentor. </p>



<p>One of the most sought after talents on their short list was Beyonce. Bey hasn&#8217;t been on the show since the season 10 finale in 2011 when she belted out her hit “Crazy in Love.” </p>



<p>Now, any hope of her stopping by is dead and buried. </p>



<p>“They would give their eye teeth to get Beyoncé back on the show as a performer and mentor. Ratings were in the tank last season, and Beyoncé brings a fan base who will watch her,” an insider explained to <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/luke-bryan-beyonce-call-out-ended-any-chance-of-idol-return-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life and Style</a></em>. </p>



<p>“But Luke calling her out pretty much ended any chance of getting her back on Idol. Beyoncé doesn’t go where she doesn’t feel wanted!”</p>



<p>And yo know who is behind that decision whole-heartedly? THE BEYHIVE!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bryan-attempts-to-appease-the-beyhive">Bryan Attempts to Appease the Beyhive</h2>



<p>Luke went on to praise the Beyhive for the loyalty they&#8217;ve shown their queen.</p>



<p>“Beyoncé has a lot of fans out there that have her back,” he noted. “And if she doesn’t get something they want, man, they come at you — as fans should do.”</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, many took issue with the insinuation that Bey was snubbed because she failed to properly ingratiate herself with the country music &#8220;family.&#8221;</p>



<p>As pop culture commentator Ashley K. Smalls <a href="https://x.com/AshleyKSmalls/status/1841658925017407505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;Keith Urban is from Australia and y’all basically made him the face of the genre. But the girl from Houston needs to prove she’s part of your world?&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2131540640-819x1024.jpg" alt="BeyoncÃ© speaks onstage during the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre on April 01, 2024 in Hollywood, California.

<p>Ironically, many of Bryan&#8217;s best-known songs, including &#8220;Country Girl (Shake It For Me)&#8221; borrow heavily from the rhythms and cadences of hip hop.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;re guessing he&#8217;s never considered the possibility that he might owe a cultural debt of his own.</p>



<p>Now, obviously, Luke and Bey are both talented artists. </p>



<p>But maybe it&#8217;s time to consider the possibility that &#8220;authenticity&#8221; is an overrated concern in music criticism. Especially since it seems like most audiences couldn&#8217;t care less about it as long as the song slaps.</p>

<p>But some wonder if the universally beloved music legend&#8217;s statement is a snub unto itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonce-jolene-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyonce covered Dolly Parton&#8217;s</a> most beloved song &#8212; a very tall order &#8212; on the snubbed album.</p>



<p>Is Dolly Parton chiming in with the disses? Or is she just being a peacemaker while spreading around the praise?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-cma-awards-excluded-beyonce-s-cowboy-carter-and-dolly-parton-has-some-thoughts-on-the-matter">The CMA Awards excluded Beyonce&#8217;s &#8216;Cowboy Carter,&#8217; and Dolly Parton has some thoughts on the matter</h2>



<p>Speaking to <em>Variety</em> in a September 17 interview, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dolly-parton-beyonce-taylor-swift-1236147283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolly Parton diplomatically</a> suggested: &#8220;Well, you never know.&#8221;</p>



<p>She pointed out: “There’s so many wonderful country artists that, I guess probably the country music field.&#8221; There certainly are.</p>



<p>Dolly Parton mused: &#8220;They probably thought, well, we can’t really leave out some of the ones that spend their whole life doing that.”</p>

<p>To be clear, Dolly Parton isn&#8217;t saying that <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonces-cowboy-carter-album-cameos-from-dolly-parton-rumi-carter-leave-fans-reeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Carter</a></em> isn&#8217;t Country. In fact, she called it a &#8220;wonderful album.&#8221;</p>



<p>“She can be very, very proud of, and I think everybody in Country music welcomed her and thought that, that was good,&#8221; Dolly continued.</p>



<p>Of the CMAs not nominating Beyonce&#8217;s album, Dolly Parton opined: &#8220;So I don’t think it was a matter of shutting out, like doing that on purpose. I think it was just more of what the Country charts and the Country artists were doing, that do that all the time, not just a specialty album.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-making-a-country-album-makes-a-lot-of-sense">Beyonce making a Country album makes a lot of sense</h2>



<p>Both Beyonce and Post Malone delved into Country. And Dolly Parton participated in both of their albums, adding that she&#8217;s &#8220;open to everything&#8221; with their future work.</p>



<p>Dolly Parton also affirmed Beyonce&#8217;s Country credentials. “She’s a country girl in Texas and Louisiana, so she grew up with that base.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Country legend emphasized: “It wasn’t like she just appeared out of nowhere. Post Malone has loved country music his whole life, and then I got to do the duet with him on his album, and I think it’s a fantastic album. I thought both those albums were great.”</p>

<p>When Beyonce wrote Cowboy Carter, it stemmed from experiencing exclusion. </p>



<p>Queen Bey has never specified, but most assume that she was referring to her 2016 performance at the CMA Awards.</p>



<p>Which of course makes her album&#8217;s snub from the CMA Awards feel like an acute jab. That and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-1-country-song-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the racist meltdowns</a> over her music playing on Country radio, especially because Bey&#8217;s album debuted at #1 on the charts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-another-hurtful-snub">Is this another hurtful snub?</h2>



<p>Only Beyonce gets to decide if Dolly Parton&#8217;s words are hurtful to her. However, it sounds like Dolly is singing Beyonce&#8217;s praises &#8230; while also suggesting that the CMA Awards exclusion was nothing personal.</p>



<p>To be blunt &#8230; Dolly Parton is giving people too much credit. That&#8217;s not a surprise, because part of what makes her so universally beloved (except by <a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/the-federalist-finds-out-its-never-smart-to-come-for-dolly-parton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weirdos at <em>The Federalist</em></a>) is that she largely stays out of politics.</p>



<p>For the most part, this is wonderful. But when someone disses Beyonce and Dolly Parton suggests that it&#8217;s an accident, her charitable statement might sting a little. Bey&#8217;s album was snubbed. People are allowed to resent that.</p>

<p>Country music&#8217;s biggest night will be without one of the world&#8217;s biggest celebrities.</p>



<p>And the world is in shock as a result.</p>



<p>On Monday, September 6, the Country Music Association revealed the full list of nominees for the 58th Annual CMA Awards&#8230; with Morgan Wallen leading the pack with seven total nods.</p>



<p>As for Beyonce? She received not a single one.</p>



<p>Not. A. Single. One.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="740" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-1024x740.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508857" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-768x555.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-2048x1480.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-960x694.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-1080x781.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2131542235-1200x867.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BeyoncÃ© accepts the Innovator Award onstage during the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 1, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartRadio)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The shut-out is galling and surprising because Beyonce took a critically-acclaimed leap by releasing her first-ever country music album a short time ago.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-1-country-song-album/">debuted atop the charts</a>.</p>



<p>Back in March, the superstar explained the inspiration behind &#8220;Cowboy Carter&#8221; by saying project was &#8220;born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added back then:</p>



<p>&#8220;Because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive. </p>



<p>&#8220;It feels good to see how music can unite so many people around the world, while also amplifying the voices of some of the people who have dedicated so much of their lives educating on our musical history.&#8221;</p>



<p>It may be safe to say that Beyonce once again does not feel welcome within this genre.</p>

<p>Beyonce&#8217;s latest album featured collaborations with country artists from Malone and Shaboozey (who received a pair of nominations today) to one of the genre&#8217;s pioneers, Linda Martell.</p>



<p>Following its March 29 release, &#8220;Cowboy Carter,&#8221; the album climbed number-one on the Billboard 200 and made Beyonce first Black woman to ever top the Hot Country Albums chart. </p>



<p>The arrist also earned top-10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 with the record’s revised cover of Dolly Parton&#8217;s &#8220;Jolene,” as well as &#8220;II Most Wanted&#8221; featuring Miley Cyrus.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you @Beyonce for opening a door for us, starting a conversation, and giving us one of the most innovative country albums of all time!&#8221; Shaboozey posted on social media after the nominations were announced.</p>

Others just wonder if this is an ongoing problem.</p>



<p>A new report says that it&#8217;s not &#8212; thanks to Beyonce setting some marital boundaries to keep Jay-Z from straying again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-and-jay-z-have-had-their-issues">Beyonce and Jay-Z have had their issues</h2>



<p>Beginning with <em>Lemonade</em>, Beyonce has exposed Jay-Z&#8217;s reported cheating through her music.</p>



<p><em>Cowboy Carter</em> is no exception. Beyonce&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Jolene&#8221; in particular seems to be a nod to Jay-Z&#8217;s wandering eye &#8212; among other body parts.</p>



<p>Even Jay-Z addressed the delicate subject on his album, <em>4:44</em>, back in 2017.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-1024x683.jpg" alt="Beyonce and Jay-Z attend an event in January of 2020." class="wp-image-497716" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_02_jayz-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z attend the Pre-GRAMMY Gala and GRAMMY Salute to Industry Icons Honoring Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs on January 25, 2020.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, a report from <em>In Touch Weekly</em> says that <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/beyonce-has-rules-for-husband-jay-z-after-past-infidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay-Z has not had any sort of affair</a> in a while.</p>



<p>The inside source says that this period of fidelity is the result of Jay-Z sticking to Beyonce&#8217;s guidelines for their marriage.</p>



<p>“Jay’s ultimately very grateful that she didn’t give up on him back in the day,” the insider affirmed.</p>

<p>“So he shows his respect by following her rules,&#8221; the source described in the report.</p>



<p>&#8220;He used to go out with the boys all the time,&#8221; the insider shared.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the source went on to explain, these days, &#8220;that’s off-limits.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="771" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-771x1024.jpg" alt="Beyonce and Jay-Z in 2019." class="wp-image-497718" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-771x1024.jpg 771w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-226x300.jpg 226w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-768x1020.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-1541x2048.jpg 1541w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-723x960.jpg 723w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-813x1080.jpg 813w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz-903x1200.jpg 903w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0412_beyonce_04_jayz.jpg 1558w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Beyonce Knowles-Carter and Jay-Z attend the European Premiere of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on July 14, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, there are some other restrictions that have less to do with his social life with the guys and more to do with his professional life.</p>



<p>&#8220;And Beyonce doesn’t like him having one-on-ones with his female talent,&#8221; the insider reported.</p>



<p>Normally, that would be an unhealthy or straight-up toxic rule. However, in the context of two spouses who have had troubles in their marriage and are trying to make it work, sometimes setting extra boundaries is healthy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-jay-z-does-more-than-just-avoid-temptations">But Jay-Z does more than just avoid temptations</h2>



<p>According to the report, Beyonce and Jay-Z make time out of their busy schedules for regular therapy sessions.</p>



<p>And, perhaps more importantly, for date nights. Otherwise, between their careers and their children, the two might begin to feel less like spouses and more like roommates.</p>



<p>“They work hard at making their marriage work,&#8221; the inside source summarized. &#8220;And they’re in a healthier place since Beyoncé put her foot down.”</p>

<p>Beyonce has made history &#8211; AGAIN! &#8211; as the first Black woman to come in at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart with her “Act II: Cowboy Carter,” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/beyonce-cowboy-carter-number-one-billboard-200-country-albums-chart-1235650662/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to <em>Billboard.</em></a></p>



<p>This coming directly off the cowboy boot heels of Beyonce&#8217;s country songs topping the charts immediately after releasing. </p>



<p>&#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em,&#8221; already made history as it&#8217;s success made her the first Black woman with a #1 country song. <em>Ever</em>.</p>



<p>Clearly, it seems the Beyhive&#8217;s vibing with the Queens new sound, but what about true blue country fans? And what about solidly country artists?</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sad to say there is division on that front, with <em>certain </em>group of people are absolutely fuming that she&#8217;s part of the music genre at all.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-truly-made-history-with-her-latest-music-number-1-in-country-music">Beyonce truly made history with her latest music: Number 1 in Country music!</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, February 20, <em>Billboard </em>announced that Beyonce&#8217;s &#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em&#8221; has hit the Number 1 spot on the Hot Country Songs chart.</p>



<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> has <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-one-country-song-texas-hold-em-1234970301/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the significance &#8212; that Beyonce is the first Black woman to top that charge since 1958, when it came into being.</p>



<p>Then, after the Cowboy Carter album dropped, Bey made history again, becoming the the first Black woman to come in at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em&#8221; and &#8220;16 Carriages&#8221; dropped immediately onto streaming services.</p>



<p>Beyonce announcing new music at the most-watched Super Bowl in history is a <em>very </em>winning combination.</p>



<p>Initially, a Country music <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/4470910-country-music-station-that-refused-to-play-beyonces-new-song-changes-course-after-pushback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radio station declined to play Beyonce&#8217;s music</a> &#8230; even though it is of the genre.</p>



<p>The fan outcry from the Beyhive and from music fans alike was intense and very justified. The radio station reversed course, with overwhelmingly positive results.</p>



<p>In fact, most other radio DJs have noted that they&#8217;d love it if Beyonce&#8217;s fans, who are only dipping their toes into the Country music pond for her sake, find that they enjoy other songs of the genre.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <em>Cowboy Carter</em> also leaped to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, making this album her eighth No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard 200!</p>



<p>The album sold 407,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in the week ending April 4, according to Luminate. </p>



<p>Not bad! Not bad at all! And yet, there is still a fierce debate over whether Beyonce&#8217;s album should even be considered country at all! </p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not just fans who are divided. There are celebs who are at odd over Beyonce&#8217;s new music venture as well. </p>



<p><em>The Dukes of Hazzard </em>alum John Schneider whined to fringe-right platform OAN that this is a case of &#8220;lefties in the entertainment industry&#8221; trying to &#8220;seize control&#8221; over country music.</p>



<p>The has-been actor suggested that Beyonce is &#8220;just like a dog in a dog walk park. You know, every dog has to mark every tree, right? So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shocking words! But not necessarily surprising words from a man whose most famous work features America&#8217;s most notorious symbol of racial hatred on the hood of the show&#8217;s &#8220;iconic&#8221; car.</p>

<p>But we digress: What&#8217;s truly frustrating is this the insinuation that Beyonce&#8217;s music is not &#8220;true&#8221; country.</p>



<p>Never mind that this is not Beyonce&#8217;s first foray into country, just her first full album. And let&#8217;s all just forget the fact that she is from Texas, we guess!</p>



<p>But, it&#8217;s certainly true that Beyonce&#8217;s music covers numerous genres. It is part of why she has such a massive, passionate fanbase.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the leaning into country elements, and sort of reclaiming country music back to Black people, because they created the genre, is such a statement,&#8221; <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1395304/marren-morris-is-already-marveling-at-beyonces-shift-back-to-country-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Country singer Maren Morris</a> told <em>E! News</em> in mid-February.</p>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The more the merrier,&#8221; Lainey Wilson told <em>Extra</em>, as you can see below. &#8220;[Country music] is about that storytelling. It’s about making people feel at home. And everybody wants to feel at home.”</p>

<p>Bobby Bones gave an impassioned speech on behalf of Beyonce&#8217;s music during a February 14 broadcast.</p>



<p>“You have, like, Post Malone, where everybody’s going ‘We can’t wait!’” the American radio personality pointed out. </p>



<p>“You’re hypocritical if you’re like, ‘I like Post Malone coming but not Beyonce,'&#8221; Bones noted. &#8220;Beyonce’s been on the CMAs, Beyonce did Sugarland … it’s crazy to me how people get upset about it.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-beyonce-s-first-rodeo">This is not Beyonce&#8217;s first rodeo</h2>



<p>The legendary singer, <em>who again is from Houston, Texas</em>, has incorporated Country elements into her music in the past. Particularly, during her 2016 hit, <em>Lemonade</em>.</p>



<p>Country music isn&#8217;t for everyone. Even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/beyonce-promises-to-replace-ableist-slur-in-renaissance-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyonce&#8217;s music isn&#8217;t for everyone</a>. Not <em>vibing </em>with specific tunes can have unsavory causes, but it isn&#8217;t inherently racist.</p>



<p>But suggesting that Beyonce&#8217;s Country songs don&#8217;t belong on a Country station? That sounds almost as racist as whatever the hell John Schneider was rambling about &#8220;dog walk parks.&#8221;</p>
