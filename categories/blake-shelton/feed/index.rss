<p>First came love, then came marriage, but a pregnant Gwen Stefani? Is that really a possibility?</p>



<p>Ever since Gwen and Blake Shelton got together, fans have been eager for them to start a family of their own.</p>



<p>Rumors have been flying for years, with “sources” suggesting everything from medical miracles to secret pregnancies and beyond.</p>



<p>On the flip side, there have also been reports that the pair are <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-marriage-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headed for a split</a>, but we choose to ignore that noise. </p>



<p>So, is Gwen Stefani, who turns 55 in October, pregnant? Let’s discuss what we know.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwen-stefani-amp-blake-shelton-love-being-parents-nbsp">Gwen Stefani &amp; Blake Shelton Love Being Parents&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-super-bowl-2024-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started dating </a>in late 2015, shortly after both of them divorced their respective spouses.</p>



<p>While they seemingly had nothing in common, it was clear from the start that they were perfectly aligned when it came to the importance of family.</p>



<p>Gwen gave birth to three children with her ex, Gavin Rossdale: Kingston, Zuma and Apollo.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Blake had no children of his own with his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. In fact, some insiders suggested that the lack of kids was the reason for their split.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the moment Blake joined the family, it was clear he was eager to be a role model for Gwen’s boys and took to being a “stepdad” even before it was official.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, he&#8217;s become such a mentor to the boys, he&#8217;s even started helping them launch their own <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/gwen-stefani-son-zuma-blake-shelton-bar-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">musical careers</a>! How about that! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-gwen-stefani-pregnant-with-blake-shelton-s-child">Is Gwen Stefani Pregnant with Blake Shelton’s Child?</h2>



<p>Cards on the table: no, Gwen isn’t pregnant. At least, not that she has announced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not completely out of the question that these two will still have a kid together &#8211; especially since they have been trying for over 7 years!</p>



<p>Gwen and Blake did not get married until 2021, but for years before that, it was reported that the pair were “hyper-focused on getting pregnant.”</p>



<p>Insiders close to the couple told outlets like <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-focused-on-getting-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> that their bond was so strong, Blake and Gwen put having a kid ahead of getting married for many years.</p>

<p>“They believe there is still a chance for Gwen,” said an Shelton insider. “They are incredibly hopeful.”</p>



<p>Despite having 3 successful pregnancies, Gwen was in her late 40’s when she started dating Blake. While celebs like Janet Jackson welcomed children into their 50’s, insiders explained that Gwen needed some help if she was going to conceive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gwen would love to get pregnant, things with Blake are so perfect, having a baby with him would be the icing on the cake.,” a Gwen insider told <em>HollywoodLife.com.</em> </p>



<p>“She’s a big believer in alternative medicine so she wants to do it in the most natural way possible. She’s been getting acupuncture and working with a Chinese herbalist to increase her fertility.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as we know, as of 2024, any attempts to have a baby have not proven fruitful yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, there is always adoption and surrogacy. And ,with them both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/blake-shelton-announces-departure-from-the-voice-after-season-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">off <em>The Voice</em></a> now, there would be no real time to focus on a family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwen-stefani-loves-being-a-mother-nbsp">Gwen Stefani Loves Being A Mother&nbsp;</h2>



<p>“I waited my whole life to be a mom. That&#8217;s all I wanted, my entire life”</p>



<p>The rock star mom appeared on a 2024 episode of <a href="https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/"><em>The Skinny Confidential Him &amp; Her Show</em></a>&#8216;s podcast, and she discussed how hard it was to juggle her kids while working, even though she loved being a mom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From working on her solo album to touring with No Doubt, Kingston was always by her side.</p>



<p>&#8220;It just felt so real and right. I got so ripped off on that tour because I was so sick. I ended up taking the baby when he was 9 months and going and doing a world tour, like 120 shows &#8230; We&#8217;re in a hotel one day and I thought that I had to stop nursing because I was like, &#8216;How am I going to nurse and be on stage?'&#8221;</p>

<p>With all that said, Gwen had thought, once upon a time, that she was too old to have another child. Then her oldest,&nbsp; Kingston started asking her to have another sibling.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m too old. I&#8217;m not having any more babies. I&#8217;m sorry, love,&#8217; &#8221; she said. &#8220;He just wanted a baby, so he would start praying every night for this baby. Four weeks later, praying every night like, &#8216;Please, let my mom have a baby,&#8217; and I&#8217;m pregnant with Apollo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gwen calls that pregnancy a miracle. She also admits she’s been lucky enough to have 3 miracles happen in her lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;[Hosting <em>The Voice</em>] was the second miracle. The first miracle was getting pregnant. The second was <em>The Voice</em>. And then the third was, obviously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-celebrate-1-year-anniversary-make-entire-universe-swoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meeting Blake</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps a fourth miracle is due? Fourth baby, fourth miracle &#8211; stranger things have happened!</p>

<p>Oh, Miranda Lambert is <em>coming </em>for Blake Shelton.</p>



<p>Even as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/miranda-lambert-hints-at-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce rumors</a> follow Miranda and her young, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/miranda-lambert-divorce-husbands-alleged-lover-speaks-out-after-shady-bar-outing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial husband</a>, her previous marriage continues to haunt her.</p>



<p>When a Country music marriage like Miranda and Blake splits and both level accusations at the other, it can create a rift in the industry itself.</p>



<p>The good news is that Miranda&#8217;s making the most of it. She&#8217;s coming for Blake in song, and creating hits out of it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-fans-know-that-miranda-lamber-its-coming-for-blake-shelton-with-her-music">How do fans know that Miranda Lamber its coming for Blake Shelton with her music?</h2>



<p>These days, Miranda Lambert is married to Brendan McLoughlin. The 32-year-old former police officer is controversial for more than just his previous career, but they&#8217;re still together.</p>



<p>However, for four years, Miranda was married to Blake Shelton. One could argue this he used his version of how their divorce went down to seduce Gwen Stefani.</p>



<p>What she went through with Blake continues to drive much of her music. Some argue that she&#8217;s still hung up on the guy, in a manner of speaking.</p>

<p>In September, Miranda Lambert <a href="https://tasteofcountry.com/miranda-lambert-interview-new-album-postcards-from-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to <em>Taste of Country</em></a> to acknowledge that her songs are autobiographical &#8212; even if she won&#8217;t outright name-drop the people involved.</p>



<p>“I signed up to tell the truth,” she characterized at the time.</p>



<p>“And I just feel like it’s important to &#8212; good, bad and ugly &#8212; tell your story,&#8221; Miranda Lambert then expressed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-miranda-lambert-s-music-saying-about-blake-shelton">What is Miranda Lambert&#8217;s music saying about Blake Shelton</h2>



<p>When fans say that Miranda Lambert is coming for Blake Shelton, they generally mean that she has issues with how things ended.</p>



<p>The two had a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-run-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bitter breakup</a> in 2015. <em>Both </em>accused the other of cheating, but Blake quickly moved on with his much more famous new <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-celebrate-1-year-anniversary-make-entire-universe-swoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wife, Gwen Stefani</a>. </p>



<p>Blake seemed to come out on top. And many have the impression that he (allegedly!) misled Gwen about his role in his divorce. Remember, she had just ended things with Gavin Rossdale amidst reports of his cheating.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Shelton on January 17, 2024 on a stage." class="wp-image-512058" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1028_blakeshelton_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">January 17: In this image released on August 13th Blake Shelton performs onstage for CMT Giants: Alabama at The Fisher Center for the Performing Arts on January 17, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for CMT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, not <em>all </em>of Miranda&#8217;s lyrics sound like she&#8217;s coming for Blake.</p>



<p>In &#8220;Run,&#8221; Miranda Lambert sings fairly positively. “Oh this freedom I found, babe, sure wasn’t free / I owe you a lifetime of apologies. I’m tellin’ the truth now / I loved you so much / I’m sorry for lyin’ about who I was.”</p>



<p>That sounds like she&#8217;s waxing nostalgic. Or, at least, like she has managed to come to terms with how things ended. That and relive the highlights of their erstwhile marriage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apparently-she-s-seeing-things-from-a-new-perspective">Apparently, she&#8217;s seeing things from a new perspective</h2>



<p>According to a report from <em>In Touch Weekly</em>, you don&#8217;t <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/blake-shelton-fodder-for-miranda-lamberts-hit-songs-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hear Miranda Lambert</a> coming for Blake Shelton in song these days because she&#8217;s been reevaluating how things went down.</p>



<p>“Miranda is older and wiser now and she no longer lays all the blame at Blake’s feet,” the insider dished.</p>



<p>According to the source: “Now it still gives her fodder for writing hit songs!” Well, that&#8217;s a great way to cope with an ugly split! Success is the best revenge.</p>

<p>Friends taking sides after a breakup can always be awkward. Blake Shelton is reportedly a little nervous about his pal Kelly Clarkson working with his ex-wife Miranda Lambert nearly 10 years after their split.</p>



<p>After Miranda appeared on <em>The Kelly Clarkson Show</em>, an <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/blake-shelton-worried-miranda-lambert-will-steal-kelly-clarkson-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider revealed</a> that Blake is nervous about his friendship with the &#8220;Since U Been Gone&#8221; singer, per <em>Life and Style.</em></p>



<p>The &#8220;Ain&#8217;t in Kansas Anymore&#8221; singer was a guest on Kelly&#8217;s talk show in late September. The country star also opened up about her new record <em>Postcards From Texas</em> for the &#8220;Songs and Stories&#8221; episode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgbgjTszbM&#038;pp=ygUebWlyYW5kYSBsYW1iZXJ0IGtlbGx5IGNsYXJrc29u
</div></figure>



<p>The ladies also performed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvTgqIyan8&amp;pp=ygUebWlyYW5kYSBsYW1iZXJ0IGtlbGx5IGNsYXJrc29u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of duets</a>. Kelly joined in on Miranda&#8217;s songs &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgbgjTszbM&amp;pp=ygUebWlyYW5kYSBsYW1iZXJ0IGtlbGx5IGNsYXJrc29u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Man&#8217;s Land&#8221;</a>, &#8220;Tin Man&#8221;, and &#8220;Gunpowder and Lead.&#8221; They also did an impromptu Chappell Roan cover, singing &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BCZS7hK3FM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Luck, Babe.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>When Miranda and Blake split in 2015, Kelly reportedly sided with the &#8220;God&#8217;s Country&#8221; singer, but now, she&#8217;s apparently been spending some time with his ex-wife. They got along great during the talk show appearance.</p>



<p>The insider revealed Kelly&#8217;s feelings about the split to <em>Life and Style</em>. &#8220;Kelly was Team Blake for a long, long time and [Blake&#8217;s wife] Gwen [Stefani], too, by default,&#8221; they said. &#8220;But now that she’s gotten to know Miranda better, she doesn’t know what Blake’s talking about.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-did-miranda-lambert-and-blake-shelton-get-divorced">When Did Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton Get Divorced?</h2>



<p>Miranda Lambert started dating Blake Shelton in 2006, when they were both rising country stars. The pair got engaged in May 2010, and they tied the knot a year later.</p>



<p>In July 2015, the couple announced that they were getting a divorce. The pair released a <a href="https://apnews.com/music-general-news-national-national-c41ed058b7254698a9d65596c41c514e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint statement</a> to announce their split to <em>The Associated Press</em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is not the future we envisioned,&#8221; they said. &#8220;It is with heavy hearts that we move forward separately. We are real people, with real lives, with real families, friends, and colleagues.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miranda-lambert-s-newfound-friendship-with-kelly-clarkson">Miranda Lambert&#8217;s Newfound Friendship With Kelly Clarkson</h2>



<p>The source said that Miranda is &#8220;putting on the charm&#8221; with Kelly, and it&#8217;s working! &#8220;Kelly’s realized Miranda’s&nbsp;not a baddie at all, in fact, she’s a sweetheart and she’s going to give her support and be kind and generous,&#8221; they said.</p>



<p>Kelly is reportedly going to continue being kind to the country icon &#8220;even if it jeopardizes her friendship with Blake.&#8221; </p>



<p>The insider did admit that Miranda may have some ulterior motives in pursuing the friendship with the <em>American Idol </em>alum. &#8220;No one would put it past Miranda to steal Kelly away and fill her head with junk about her ex,&#8221; they explained.</p>



<p>The insider continued, and they explained that Miranda&#8217;s moves to befriend Kelly seem to be working. &#8220;The feeling is Kelly would believe anything. She’s incredibly nice but gullible,&#8221; they said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-and-miranda-s-current-spouses">Blake and Miranda&#8217;s Current Spouses</h2>



<p>Since their 2015 divorce, Blake and Miranda <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-run-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have each re-married,</a> and they seem very happy in their respective relationships.</p>



<p>In February 2019, the <em>Palomino </em>singer announced that she tied the knot with Brendan McLoughlin. Brendan is a New York City police officer. Miranda occasionally shares cute photos and videos of him on her social media.</p>



<p>After the divorce, Blake revealed that he&#8217;d started dating his <em>The Voice </em>co-star Gwen Stefani in late 2015. The No Doubt frontwoman had also recently gone through a divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale.</p>



<p>Blake and Gwen revealed that they had bonded over their divorces while shooting <em>The Voice</em>, and eventually, their friendship turned romantic. The pair have sang numerous duets together, and they regularly gush about one another on social media and in interviews.</p>

<p>Despite his rocker parents, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-run-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a> and Gavin Rossdale’s son is following in his step dad’s footsteps.</p>



<p>Music fans were floored this week when Gwen’s son Zuma, 15, made his performing debut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, one would think he’d be spotted rocking out on an electric guitar like his father or raging into the mic like his mom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it seems Gwen’s 10 year relationship with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/blake-shelton-divorced-his-marriage-history-to-gwen-stefani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton</a> has had an influence on the teen.</p>



<p>Turns out, he’s a little bit country, not the least bit rock and roll!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwen-stefani-s-son-zuma-performs-at-blake-shelton-s-bar"><strong>Gwen Stefani’s Son Zuma Performs At Blake Shelton’s Bar</strong></h2>



<p>Zuma made his country music debut at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/gwen-stefani-speaks-on-blake-shelton-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton</a>’s Ole Red bar in Oklahoma on Monday, July 29.</p>



<p>Before the 15-year-old took the stage, Blake introduced his stepson to an adoring, cheering crowd.</p>



<p>In a video taken by fans, you can see Blake set Zuma up at the mic, giving it an adjust, before Zuma steps out looking like Blake’s literal mini me!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The teen stepped out with a guitar in hand, playing the instrument on a stool in a cowboy hat, jeans and boots. Just like Blake would!</p>



<p>Speaking of Blake, the proud step dad stayed close by, in case the kid needed anything while he crooned out Zach Bryan’s “Oklahoma Smokeshow.”</p>



<p>Maybe “God’s Country” wasn’t in his vocal range?! </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just look how proud <a href="https://twitter.com/blakeshelton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@blakeshelton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gwenstefani?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gwenstefani</a> are of Zuma. He sounds amazing ! <a href="https://t.co/EbIZuFXCTX">pic.twitter.com/EbIZuFXCTX</a></p>&mdash; Kate????????????B&amp;G???? (@forgwenandblake) <a href="https://twitter.com/forgwenandblake/status/1818085580192063672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fans-loved-it">The Fans Loved It</h2>



<p>Turns out, the kid with the musically included parents has a good voice! Both folks in the audience &#8211; like mom Gwen Stefani &#8211; and socal media users who saw the video were surprised and delighted by his singing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh my god he’s so good ???” one person <a href="https://x.com/carlysgwen/status/1818085960036332030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote via X</a>, while another <a href="https://x.com/olered02/status/1818082400133603547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">praising the teen’s “incredible” vocals</a>.</p>



<p>Now, this seems to be a right of passage for Gwen’s kids.  Zuma’s viral moment comes one year after his older brother, Kingston, similarly <a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/08/14/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdales-son-kingston-sings-at-blake-sheltons-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wowed fans at Shelton’s bar</a>.</p>



<p>Kingston was born in 2006, followed by Zuma two years later and their now-10-year-old brother, Apollo, in 2014.</p>



<p>So, give the youngin’ some time. Few more years, he might be joining his brothers up there. Maybe they’ll start a band?! A country leaning Hanson perhaps?</p>



<p>One things for sure: so far, none of the boys have busted out a version of Bush&#8217;s &#8220;Glycerine&#8221;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale-s-boys">Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale’s Boys</h2>



<p>All three of Gwen’s sons were fathered by the Bush frontman during their marriage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They called it quits in 2015, and while it’s rare to see Gavin out with his boys, they still have a very good relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Gavin has admitted in recent interviews that he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/gavin-rossdale-no-connection-gwen-stefani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regrets the end of his marriage</a>, and how it’s affected his relationship with his kids. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel bad for my kids, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; Rossdale said on an episode of Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes&#8217; <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/dont-beat-around-the-bush-with-gavin-rossdale/id1719095006?i=1000649935086"><em>Amy &amp; T.J.</em> podcast</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;That would be the most profound thing, of like, I wish I could have just figured out a way to not have that in their lives.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on his own upbringing and how it influenced his music, he added, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t fun for me to be from a broken home. I think in a way it gave me a career so I don&#8217;t mind, because I turned it around into sort of an interesting career path, but it can be quite debilitating for kids… The overriding thing is like, you don&#8217;t want to let your kids down.&#8221;</p>



<p>He may feel like he let them down, but they look pretty happy. Sometimes the best thing you can do is let go, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And now they have a terrific 3rd parent in Blake. Couldn’t ask for anything better than that!</p>

<p>Gwen Stefani and Miranda Lambert had a bit of an awkward run-in.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/miranda-lambert-pregnant-planning-to-expand-family-with-brendan-mcloughlin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miranda Lambert is happily with Brendan McLoughlin</a> and Blake Shelton has famously moved on with the legendary Gwen Stefani.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a small world. <em>Especially </em>for Country stars (and their partners) who run in similar professional circles.</p>



<p>Gwen and Blake don&#8217;t seem to mind highlighting the inherent awkwardness of running into your ex &#8212; or your husband&#8217;s ex. Especially since Blake and Miranda did not part on good terms.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miranda-lambert-blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-seemed-to-have-an-awkward-run-in">Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani seemed to have an awkward run-in</h2>



<p>At the 2024 ACM Awards on Thursday, May 16, Miranda Lambert debuted a new song, &#8220;Wranglers.&#8221;</p>



<p>But she was not the only former member of her erstwhile marriage to perform. </p>



<p>Blake Shelton stood up on stage mere moments later. He and Gwen Stefani performed &#8220;Purple Irises,&#8221; their new duet that they unveiled recently.</p>

<p>Naturally, plenty of social media users, including Twitter&#8217;s remaining user base, were quick to observe how (presumably still bitter) exes Blake and Miranda performed back-to-back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Miranda Lambert playing her song Wranglers in front of Blake Shelton and later Blake and Gwen singing a duet in front of Miranda is MUST SEE TV,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/mayhemmatthew/status/1791270642622271930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> one user.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-everyone-was-team-miranda-either">Not everyone was Team Miranda, either</h2>



<p>&#8220;Blake Shelton going from Miranda lambert to Gwen Stefani might possibly be the biggest upgrade of all time,&#8221; another <a href="https://x.com/DetSportsSZN/status/1791275696016286108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter user</a> expressed.</p>



<p>Others simply marveled at the audacity of scheduling them back to back. One <a href="https://x.com/marcadelman/status/1791275740912103919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeter</a> highlighted: &#8220;They are all here! Miranda! Blake. Gwen!&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/lifeasshadae/status/1791258731822358962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tweeted</a> another: &#8220;The [#ACMawards] having Miranda Lambert and Gwen-Blake in the same performance line up is CRAZY to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither Blake Shelton nor Miranda Lambert have a lot of high ground. The formerly married couple both accused each other of cheating.</p>



<p>In fact, they were both in relationships before performing a duet together that sparked their relationships. Blake had been married at the time, while Miranda was engaged.</p>



<p>Blake spoke about Miranda&#8217;s alleged cheating while bonding with Gwen Stefani (at the time a fellow <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/john-legend-the-voice-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coach on <em>The Voice</em></a>) in 2015. This was after she had described Gavin Rossdale&#8217;s alleged cheating.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-awkwardness-will-continue">The awkwardness will continue</h2>



<p>Blake and Gwen bonding over both being (alleged) victims of cheating spouses ended up forming the foundation of their relationship. Only Gwen, out of all of them, has never faced cheating accusations.</p>



<p>It was an odd union. Gwen is a mainstream music artist, while Blake &#8212; like his ex, Miranda &#8212; is a star within the niche genre of Country. Somehow, he has <em>wrangled </em>Gwen into his world, rather than the other way around.</p>



<p>This will likely not be the last backstage run-in between Blake, his current wife, and his ex-wife. Especially not if Country Music events want to make headlines.</p>

<p>Blake Shelton is discussing a possible return to <em>The Voice</em>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s great news for fans. But viewers who enjoy all-important <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-voice-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rotations of <em>The Voice</em> coaches</a> may be less eager for him to return.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/will-blake-shelton-be-at-coachella-fans-are-hoping-hell-join-gwen-stefani-on-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton showed up at Coachella</a>, it was to support Gwen Stefani. Her No Doubt reunion was one of the hottest acts at the annual music festival.</p>



<p>Truth be told, he doesn&#8217;t sound too eager to resume his coaching position. But he&#8217;s clearly not ruling out anything.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-people-first-learned-of-blake-shelton-by-watching-the-voice">Many people first learned of Blake Shelton by watching &#8216;The Voice&#8217;</h2>



<p>Though Blake Shelton was already popular within the niche music genre of Country, his music has not broken into the mainstream. However, his name and face have.</p>



<p>Part of that is because of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/gwen-stefani-speaks-on-blake-shelton-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his famous wife, Gwen Stefani</a>. But part of that is because of his longtime role as a coach on <em>The Voice</em>, starting with its premiere in 2011.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/why-blake-shelton-left-the-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton exited <em>The Voice</em></a> following Season 23. That means 23 consecutive seasons over 12 consecutive years.</p>

<p>On Sunday, April 21, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An3nCM-Abbg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton spoke</a> to <em>Extra TV</em> to admit that he has no official plans to return to his coaching role. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ever plan on working at <em>The Voice</em> again,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>However, he also has not ruled anything out. In fact, he offered a tease for what the future may bring.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-never-say-never">Never say never!</h2>



<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; Blake Shelton then mused about a possible <em>The Voice</em> comeback. &#8220;That&#8217;s me sitting here as I say that right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>He fully admitted: &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I wouldn&#8217;t come by for a surprise appearance.&#8221;</p>



<p>A cameo comeback isn&#8217;t the same thing as a coaching position. He has positive memories of that high-paying gig, however.</p>

<p>Not only did he introduce himself to new audience and rake in a colossal amount of money in the process, but he also met his wife on the show.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I left, I feel like I really left; we all love each other,&#8221; he emphasized of the team of coaches on <em>The Voice</em>. In other words, it was not a bitter parting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-why-did-blake-shelton-leave-the-voice-in-the-first-place">So why did Blake Shelton leave &#8216;The Voice&#8217; in the first place?</h2>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it for 23 seasons without missing a single season, you know?&#8221; Blake explained. &#8220;I know what you feel like, Pat Sajak!&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/pat-sajack-to-retire-from-wheel-of-fortune-after-41-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sajak hosted <em>Wheel of Fortune</em></a> for 41 years. Starting this autumn, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/vanna-white-married-or-not-relationships-engagements-former-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the legendary Vanna White</a> will co-host, unfortunately alongside Ryan Seacrest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because that&#8217;s kind of how I was starting to feel,&#8221; Shelton admitted. &#8220;If you&#8217;re on back-to-back seasons, there&#8217;s really no time for any other thing, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>He then reasoned: &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t want to have a family and a life that much you could do it, but something has to give. It was time for The Voice to be thing that gives.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Blake Shelton wraps up yet another successful tour, fans are hoping the singer will make a surprise appearance at Coachella!</p>



<p>Shelton has never played the iconic music festival before, but that could easily change this year.</p>



<p>In addition to the fact that his schedule is newly open, Blake&#8217;s wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/gwen-stefani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a>, will be providing one of this year&#8217;s most anticipated performances.</p>



<p>Gwen will be reuniting with members of No Doubt on Coachella&#8217;s main stage.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="792" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-1024x792.jpg" alt="Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani perform on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016 in Burbank, California." class="wp-image-497606" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-1024x792.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-300x232.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-768x594.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-2048x1583.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-960x742.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-1080x835.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-531294500-1200x928.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani perform on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016 in Burbank, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It will be the first time in 10 years that Gwen will perform with the band that helped make her famous in the &#8217;90s.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-blake-shelton-join-gwen-stefani-at-coachella">Will Blake Shelton Join Gwen Stefani at Coachella?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/gwen-stefani-no-doubt-coachella-cover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nylon</a></em>, Gwen discussed her relationship with Blake through a professional lens.</p>



<p>She revealed that collaborating with her husband is her greatest joy as a singer-songwriter, and she suggested that they might one day release an album together.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-1024x683.jpg" alt="Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the Warner Music Group Pre-Grammy Party at Hollywood Athletic Club on January 23, 2020 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-497607" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1201600994-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the Warner Music Group Pre-Grammy Party at Hollywood Athletic Club on January 23, 2020 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images for Warner Music)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I feel like Blake and I are already a project together,” Stefani told the outlet.</p>



<p> “I’m always going to want to write music with Blake Shelton.”</p>



<p>Gwen went on to note that she and Blake have already dueted on several songs in the past, including the single &#8220;Purple Irises,&#8221; which they released earlier this year.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="754" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-1024x754.jpg" alt="Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the 48th Annual AFI Life Achievement Award Honoring Julie Andrews at Dolby Theatre on June 09, 2022 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-497609" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-300x221.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-768x566.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-2048x1508.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-960x707.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-1080x795.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402036338-1200x884.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the 48th Annual AFI Life Achievement Award Honoring Julie Andrews at Dolby Theatre on June 09, 2022 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for TNT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The song&#8217;s lyrics were inspired in part by the challenges of life in the spotlight and the divorce rumors that have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/gwen-stefani-speaks-on-blake-shelton-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagued Gwen and Blake</a> in recent years.</p>



<p>“The truth is I am in love with my best friend, and all this sh-t I’m thinking of in my brain, that’s all it is,” she said.</p>



<p>“When you’re in love and have truly aligned values, nobody can get to us. You can say whatever you want to say about our relationship — I mean, a week ago we were getting divorced again or something. It’s just lies,&#8221; Gwen continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The truth is the truth, and we know what that is. And so that [negativity] would never penetrate just by me being vulnerable and sharing a song that I didn’t write for anybody else but myself and Blake.”</p>



<p>Neither Blake nor Gwen has commented on the possibility that he&#8217;ll join her on stage at Coachella.</p>



<p>But as many fans have noted, the timing is certainly right for Shelton to take on a new project.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-blake-shelton">What&#8217;s Next For Blake Shelton?</h2>



<p>Following in Gwen&#8217;s footsteps, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/why-blake-shelton-left-the-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake left <em>The Voice</em></a> earlier this year, and he recently wrapped one of the biggest and most ambitious tours of his career.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was one hell of a tour y’all!!!&#8221; Blake wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5WnwIVOvNE/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> this week in tribute to the band and crew that made the tour possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s hear it for the band and crew that worked so hard every day to help us give y’all the best show!!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>So Blake has some time on his hands, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that he&#8217;s planning to join Gwen on stage at Coachella.</p>



<p>In fact, we&#8217;d be surprised if he does &#8212; after all, country and ska would make for a very strange mix of genres.</p>



<p>But hey, it&#8217;s Coachella! Anything is possible!</p>

<p>Gwen Stefani is breaking her silence on the Blake Shelton divorce rumors. </p>



<p>It took the pair 6 years to finally call themselves man and wife. Yet, since the moment Blake put a ring on it, folks have waited to see the couple fail.</p>



<p>After all, Blake Shelton is a divorced man. Has he really gotten it right the second time around?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-still-together">Are Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Still Together?</h2>



<p>Everyone take a deep breath: Gwen and Blake are indeed still together and happily so. And you don&#8217;t have to take our word for it; Gwen will happily speak for herself. </p>



<p>In an April 2024 interview with Nylon Magazine, Gwen opened up about her insecurities and how intrusive thoughts have made her question a lot, even<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/gwen-stefani-speaks-on-blake-shelton-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> her marriage</a>. </p>



<p>“The truth is I am in love with my best friend,” the 54-year-old shared, after confessing to &#8220;overthinking&#8221; her life  during tough times, </p>



<p>In fact, it was those very feelings that led Stefani to write her latest song, “Purple Irises.”</p>



<p>“I had been going through those times where you’re questioning: ‘Oh my gosh, am I just getting older? Am I cute?&#8217;”</p>



<p>Answers: yes and yes, but we digress. That uncertainty started to spill into her questioning her own marriage with Blake.</p>



<p>“In my own relationship, even though I know the truth of what’s happening today, you still create drama in your own mind about your insecurities and what might happen.</p>



<p>“I was in that phase of the relationship with Blake and getting paranoid.”</p>



<p>Now, none of this sounds very good, and even sounds like a one way ticket to divorce town. But no, the point of the confession was to make clear that she now has no doubt (get it?) that she&#8217;s with the right man. </p>



<p>“And all this sh-t I’m thinking of in my brain, that’s all it is — I’m overthinking.”</p>

We&#8217;re big fans of this famous couple.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-shelton-divorced-his-marriage-before-gwen">Blake Shelton Divorced: His Marriage Before Gwen</h2>



<p>Perhaps the reason so many people are convinced the couple have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-marriage-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marriage problems</a> is that they both are divorced from previous partners. </p>



<p>Blake Shelton tied the knot in 2011 to his country music girlfriend Miranda Lambert. If there was a prom king and queen crowned in the music genre, these two were it. </p>



<p>But like most high school romances, this one wasn&#8217;t meant to last. The pair didn&#8217;t even last 5 years, announcing their divorce in July 2015, just hours after things were finalized. </p>



<p>The pair have had a passively continuous relationship ever since, which only adds to the mystery of why they broke up to begin with.  Still, it paved the way for him to be with Gwen. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-497569" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1745087571.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gwen Stefani with her children Kingston Rossdale, Apollo Rossdale, and Zuma Rossdale, along with Blake Sheleton at her Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Ceremony  on October 19, 2023 in Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Gwen also divorced her first husband, Gavin Rossdale, who she had three children with. The exes split the same year as Blake and Miranda.</p>



<p>They first met in 1995, then tied the knot in 2002. They announced their split in 2015 amid rumors that Gavin had been unfaithful. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rumors-gwen-amp-blake-are-over">The Rumors Gwen &amp; Blake Are Over </h2>



<p>But even despite all of this, ever since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/07/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-boom-were-married/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen and Blake married </a>in 2021, &#8220;insiders&#8221; have suggested their just days away from a divorce. </p>



<p>Then of course, there are the fans. They started rumors of trouble in paradise when they noticed that Blake had yet to make his first appearance on Gwen’s Instagram page in 2023.</p>



<p>NOTE: It was like seven weeks into the new year. SPOILER ALERT: He showed up!</p>



<p>But when he did show his face, apparently that wasn&#8217;t good enough either!</p>



<p>Fears that these two cooled on each other seemed to be confirmed when they attended NASCAR’s Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum in L.A. on February 5, 2023.</p>



<p>Spectators noted that while Gwen appeared to be enjoying herself during a cameo in the broadcast booth, Blake did not look to be having such a great time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="659" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229-1024x659.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-497570" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229-1024x659.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229-300x193.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229-768x494.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229-960x618.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229-1080x695.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1734336229.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gwen Stefani and her husband Blake Shelton embrace during her Hollywood Walk of Fame Star ceremony on Hollywood, California, on October 19, 2023. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“They looked miserable,” <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-marriage-problems-burnout-fighting/">one onlooker</a> told <em>Radar Online</em>. “Things just seemed really tense,” a second spectator noted.</p>



<p>The outlet then tapped their insider network to ask if there was trouble brewing, which of course, according to them, there was. </p>



<p>“It seems like they argue constantly now — they’ve even slept in separate bedrooms after particularly bad fights.”</p>



<p>Um, not to poke holes, but if you Google celebs in separate bedrooms, some couples say it actually works wonders for their relationship!</p>



<p>But again, we digress. </p>



<p>Gwen says things are fine, so we just have to take her at her word. If anything changes &#8230; then we&#8217;ll talk. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s be clear right up front, shall we?</p>



<p>There is no drama between Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton.</p>



<p>Back in January, yes, there was some speculation that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-marriage-problems/">the spouses might split up</a>&#8230; but not based on any sort of concrete evidence of any shape, form or kind.</p>



<p>Anonymous sources simply alleged the singers were living separate lives.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-1024x682.jpg" alt="Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton photo" class="wp-image-497469" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2046249769-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton perform onstage during day one for the Warner Music Nashville Lunch during CRS 2024 at Omni Nashville Hotel on February 28, 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Danielle Del Valle/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-super-bowl-2024-divorce-rumors/">Stefani and Shelton were seen acting</a> all close and cozy at the latest Super Bowl, and the rumors have since quieted down.</p>



<p>Still, the former No Doubt lead admitted to insecurities in a new interview, explaining how they can still creep into her mind now and then. </p>



<p>And also into her music.</p>



<p>In fact, it was this very feeling that led prompted Stefani to write her new song, &#8220;Purple Irises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been going through those times where you&#8217;re questioning: &#8216;Oh my gosh, am I just getting older? Am I cute?'&#8221; Gwen told NYLON in an interview for its relaunched print magazine, which was released on April 9. </p>



<p>&#8220;In my own relationship, even though I know the truth of what&#8217;s happening today, you still create drama in your own mind about your insecurities and what might happen. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was in that phase of the relationship with Blake and getting paranoid.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Us Weekly so often says, stars really are just like us, huh? They have relationship concerns, too.</p>

<p>Thankfully for Stefani, she knows these concerns are not based in reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;The truth is I am in love with my best friend,&#8221; the 54-year-old continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;And all this sh-t I&#8217;m thinking of in my brain, that&#8217;s all it is &#8212; I&#8217;m overthinking.&#8221;</p>



<p>We say again: Just like us, wouldn&#8217;t you say? Just like pretty much everyone who has ever loved and ever lived.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been chatter about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/gwen-stefani-pregnant/">Stefani even being pregnant</a> with baby number-four, but the veteran musician says she and Shelton &#8212; who got married in 2021 &#8212; simply try to remain as grounded as possible, whenever possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re in love and have truly aligned values, nobody can get to us. You can say whatever you want to say about our relationship &#8212; I mean, a week ago we were getting divorced again or something,&#8221; Stefani added in this chat about all the speculation. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just lies. The truth is the truth, and we know what that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blake Shelton, one of the OG hosts, has left <em>The Voice</em>.</p>



<p>Between this and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/why-gwen-stefani-left-the-voice-music-family-2024-season-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani&#8217;s departure from <em>The Voice</em></a>, the long-running talent series will never be the same again.</p>



<p>Gwen&#8217;s husband stepping down from the coaching role where he met his wife has hit fans hard.</p>



<p>Fans want to know why Blake quit &#8230; and when, or <em>if</em>, he plans to return.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-shelton-has-been-part-of-the-voice-since-day-1">Blake Shelton has been part of &#8216;The Voice&#8217; since Day 1</h2>



<p><em>The Voice</em> debuted in 2011, and Blake Shelton was part of the original lineup of coaches. Though he is not quite as famous or successful as his wife, Blake is a big name within the Country music niche, and offered his expertise to contestants.</p>



<p>To date, Blake has had the most wins in <em>The Voice</em>&#8216;s history. He has nine victories, from Seasons 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 18, 20, and 22.</p>



<p>Perhaps Blake is an exemplary coach. Or maybe he just has an eye for picking winners. Either way, that&#8217;s an impressive run.</p>

<p>On a more personal level, Blake met his beautiful and talented <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-super-bowl-2024-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wife, Gwen Stefani</a>. She joined The Voice as a coach on Season 7, which aired in 2014.</p>



<p>A couple of years later, Gwen told her fellow coaches the heartbreaking story of cheating that ended her marriage. She and Blake bonded over that.</p>



<p>In 2016, Gwen and Blake were dating &#8212; which came as a shock to their wildly disparate groups of fans. They became engaged in 2020, and married in July of 2021.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-blake-shelton-leave-the-voice-after-all-of-these-years">Why did Blake Shelton leave &#8216;The Voice&#8217; after all of these years?</h2>



<p>In may of 2023, Blake Shelton departed<em> The Voice</em> to spend more <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-marriage-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time with his family</a>. </p>



<p>That family includes not only his beautiful wife, but her three children &#8212; who are his three stepchildren.</p>



<p>“I think being a stepdad has changed my perspective in that I’m not the first person that I think about anymore,&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoGBNQgLHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake explained</a> to <em>Access Hollywood</em> in an interview that you can watch right here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even to the small little things when you go, ‘I think I’ll do this,’ the very next thought is always, ‘Well, wait a minute,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Blake elaborated, describing thinking: &#8220;How’s that going work?&#8217; Or, &#8216;What will they think?&#8217; Or, &#8216;How will that affect a schedule?'&#8221; &nbsp;</p>



<p>That is a decent summary of how human being think about scheduling and priorities.</p>

<p>“I think the only way for me to really do that right is to step away from being committed to something like <em>The Voice</em> that demands a lot of your time,&#8221; Blake then reasoned.</p>



<p>&#8220;There’s no way around it,&#8221; he emphasized. &#8220;If you’re going to do it and do it right, you have to be 150 percent in.&#8221;</p>



<p>Blake acknowledged: &#8220;And I just feel like those days are behind me for now. I got a more important job.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXVRlWlxa2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani explained why Blake Shelton left <em>The Voice</em></a> in her own interview, with <em>Extra</em>. </p>



<p>“I think that Blake — I don’t know, I think he just wants more time, you know what I mean?&#8221; Gwen explained last year. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t know that people realize, if he’s doing two seasons a year, right? In between that, he’s touring,&#8221; Gwen pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he actually has two teams at the same time; at a certain point, they overlap,&#8221; Gwen spelled out.</p>



<p>&#8220;So it’s a lot of brain power, it’s a lot of time away from the family, those kinds of things,&#8221; she elaborated.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he just got to a point where he just wants time in his ranch,&#8221; Gwen reasoned. &#8220;Like time to just do the other things that he loves to do.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-will-blake-shelton-return-to-the-voice-if-at-all">When will Blake Shelton return to &#8216;The Voice&#8217; &#8230; if at all?</h2>



<p>In an interview with <em>People</em>, <a href="https://people.com/country/blake-shelton-putting-family-first-barmageddon-cover-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton hinted</a> that he doesn&#8217;t see this as a permanent departure.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to get some time back away from <em>The Voice</em> and concentrate more on, &#8216;What kind of record do I want to make? Is it going to fit in? Do I care? Do I not care?&#8217; I got a lot to figure out,&#8221; he expressed in late 2022.</p>



<p>When some says talks about &#8220;time away from,&#8221; it usually means that they plan on going back. It sounds like it&#8217;s only a matter of time.</p>
