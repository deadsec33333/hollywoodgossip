<p>Last night, Mikey hosted SNL for the first time. Needless to say, this is definitely an exciting time in her career!</p>



<p>As the reaches one major milestone after another, get to know more about Mikey here!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-began-acting-as-a-teen">Mikey Madison Began Acting As a Teen</h2>



<p>Born in Los Angeles in 1999, Mikey began appearing in short films when she was a teenager. Her first handful of roles were in short films, including 2013&#8217;s <em>Retirement </em>and <em>Pani&#8217;s Box</em>.</p>



<p>Her first feature length film was <em>Liza, Liza, Skies are Grey, </em>which was released in 2017. In 2016, she was cast in a starring role in the dramedy <em>Better Things</em>. She played creator and star Pamela Adlon&#8217;s teen daughter Max.</p>



<p>Prior to her hit role in <em>Anora</em>, she appeared in other major films like <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>, <em>The Addams Family</em>, and <em>Scream</em>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anora-is-her-breakout-role">&#8216;Anora&#8217; Is Her Breakout Role</h2>



<p>In 2024, Mikey became a major star when she portrayed the titular sex worker in <em>Anora</em>. Writer-director Sean Baker had written the part specifically for the actress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-was-a-horseback-rider-before-she-was-an-actress">Mikey Madison Was A Horseback Rider Before She Was an Actress</h2>



<p>Before devoting herself to acting full-time, Mikey had a very intense career path: horseback riding. Her family is made up of dedicated equestrians and cowboys, according to a January 2025 profile in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mikey-madison-anora-lady-in-the-lake-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Cut</em>.</a></p>



<p>While she&#8217;s no longer a competitive horseback rider, the <em>Better Things </em>star has retained an interest in horses. Early in that profile, the writer notes that she was perusing horses available for adoption.</p>



<p>She admitted that it was &#8220;painful&#8221; to give up riding to pursue acting. &#8220;I loved the ritual of getting to the barn and taking care of my horse, but it’s kind of an isolating sport,” she told the outlet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-has-a-twin-brother">She Has A Twin Brother</h2>



<p>Mikey has four siblings, including one twin brother. It&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s very close with her twin, and she&#8217;s referenced him in a few interviews.</p>



<p>She mentioned wanting to collaborate with her brother on a few future projects in the above-mentioned <em>Cut </em>interview. &#8220;I have a couple of personal stories that I’d love to work with my twin brother on,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Additionally, she mentioned that she spoke with her brother after finding out about her Oscar nomination in a <em><a href="https://variety.com/lists/oscars-nomination-reactions-ariana-grandes-demi-moore-mikey-madison/mikey-madison-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> </em>interview. &#8220;I was on FaceTime with my mom, my dad, my dog and my twin brother this morning, and I’m humbled; absolutely overjoyed,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s clear that they&#8217;re very close now, Mikey admitted that back when they were growing up there was some distance between her and her twin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My twin brother would pretend that we weren&#8217;t siblings, people would be like on the last day of school &#8216;Miles why would you be getting into [Mikey&#8217;s] car with her?&#8217; and he was like, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s my sister,'&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGoTBupUZT8&amp;pp=ygUPdyBtaWtleSBtYWRpc29u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W</a>.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;He has since apologized,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-is-a-proud-dog-amp-cat-mom">Mikey Madison Is a Proud Dog &amp; Cat Mom</h2>



<p>Given her background in horseback riding, it should come as no surprise to learn that Mikey has a soft spot for animals. She gushed about both of her pets in an August 2024 <em><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61777335/mikey-madison-interview-2024/">Esquire</a> </em>profile.</p>



<p>Her pets have cute names that go hand-in-hand with each other. &#8220;His name is Jam, because I have a cat named Biscuit,&#8221; she told the magazine. Adorable! </p>

<p>No, to answer the question you may have after reading the headline above. It&#8217;s not Emma Watson.</p>



<p>Instead, Jessie Cave &#8212; best known for playing Lavender Brown in the Harry Potter film franchise &#8212; announced this week that she has opened an OnlyFans account.</p>



<p>Before anyone goes <em>too</em> crazy over this confirmation, the page doesn&#8217;t sound as if it will be <em>too</em> X-rated.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521150" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1353461098-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jessie Cave attends the UK Premiere of &#8220;A Boy called Christmas&#8221; at The Natural History Museum on November 15, 2021 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In an Instagram post, Cave explained to her boyfriend that this OnlyFans account would contain “the best quality hair sounds” and “very sensual stuff.” </p>



<p>She also emphasized the platform would not be sexual, but “it is a fetish, I think. I hope.”</p>



<p>OnlyFans, of course, requires readers/viewers to pay a subscription fee in exchange for exclusive access to various photos and videos &#8212; typically from people who are at least semi-famous&#8230; and typically from those who post scantily-clad images and/or pieces of footage of themselves.</p>



<p>This is not what many folks would expect from an actress who played a key role in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.</p>

<p>Via Substack, Cave further broke down her reasoning for starting an OnlyFans account a couple days ago, stating that it&#8217;s really just a money issue.</p>



<p>She hasn&#8217;t exactly been breaking the bank in Hollywood.</p>



<p>“One year. I’ll try for one year,” Cave wrote. </p>



<p>“My aim? To get the house safe, cover the arsenic/lead wallpaper, build a new roof etc. My aim? To get out of debt. My aim? To empower myself? To prove to those in the past who have misjudged me that I’m not so sweet? To put time into something I never invested in before: self-love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aside from her role in the Harry Potter universe, Cave has appeared in such hits shows as Industry, Call the Midwife, and Black Mirror.</p>



<p>“Were my years of Harry Potter conventions in fact research? [It feels] like I’m doing something naughty, something a little f-cked up. I like that. Ripping up the good little actress rule book,&#8221; Cave added on her Substack page.</p>



<p>Cave is far from the only mainstream actress to turn to OnlyFans. Most notably, The Sopranos cast member Drea de Matteo admitted that she created an account that helped her keep her family residence.</p>



<p>“OnlyFans saved my life, 100 percent,” she previously told TheDailyMail.com. </p>



<p>“I can’t believe I’m saying that, but it really did save us. Anybody that wants to condemn me and put me down, go for it. I just hope you never find yourself in the position I was in to take care of two little kids. It saved my home of many years that was very important to us.”</p>

<p>Bob Dylan is one of the most important figures in all of rock music. And now, over 60 years into his career, he&#8217;s the subject of the new biopic <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>starring Timothée Chalamet. </p>



<p>Timothée&#8217;s performance is already getting buzz, and it seems likely that the movie will be a hit! The James Mangold-directed film is set in the first half of the 60s, chronicling Bob&#8217;s arrival in New York up until his 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance.</p>



<p>The movie is set to hit theaters on Christmas Day 2024, and critics are already starting to praise Timothée&#8217;s portrayal of Bob. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> for the film gave fans a sneak peak in October 2024.</p>

<p>Before going to see Timothée bring Bob&#8217;s early days to the big screen, there are lots of things to know about the <em>Blonde on Blonde </em>singer. Keep reading to learn more about Bob.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-real-name-isn-t-bob-dylan">His Real Name Isn&#8217;t Bob Dylan</h2>



<p>It may come as a surprise to some, but Bob Dylan&#8217;s real name is not &#8220;Bob Dylan.&#8221; Bob was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Minnesota in 1941. </p>



<p>As to why Bob chose &#8220;Dylan&#8221; for his surname, the most common legend refers to him borrowing it from the poet <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/dylan-thomas-patti-smith-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Thomas</a>, who was shouted out on Taylor Swift&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/the-tortured-poets-department-everything-we-know-about-taylor-swifts-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>.</a></p>

<p>Despite this being the most common claim, the man himself actually denied those rumors in a 1961 <em>New York Times</em> interview. &#8220;I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas,&#8221; he said, via <em><a href="https://wmgk.com/2018/05/24/bob-went-zimmerman-dylan/">WMGK</a></em>. &#8220;Dylan Thomas’ poetry is for people that aren’t really satisfied in their bed – for people who dig masculine romance.&#8221; </p>



<p>He did explain that he always intended on changing his name in his memoir <em>Chronicles: Volume 1</em>. He didn&#8217;t explain if there was a deeper meaning to choosing &#8220;Dylan&#8221; as his last name.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first time I was asked my name in the Twin Cities, I instinctively and automatically, without thinking, simply said: ‘Bob Dylan,'&#8221; he wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just called myself Robert Allen. As far as I was concerned, that was who I was – that’s what my parents named me. It sounded like the name of a Scottish king, and I liked it. There was little of my identity that wasn’t in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob has a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/10/bob-dylan-to-nobel-prize-committee-keep-your-sh-tty-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discography</a>. When you&#8217;ve been making music for over 60 years, you&#8217;ve had a lot of time to make some albums, and there&#8217;s plenty of Dylan material for new fans to dive into.</p>



<p>Bob&#8217;s first album was 1962&#8217;s self-titled record, and his most recent was 2023&#8217;s <em>Shadow Kingdom</em>. Over the past 60 years, Bob has released tons of classics like <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/11/bob-dylan-drops-like-a-rolling-stone-music-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highway 61 Revisited</a>, Blood on the Tracks, </em>and many more.</p>



<p>Many of Bob&#8217;s early hits weren&#8217;t for his own performances. Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221;, &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221;, and &#8220;Mr. Tambourine Man&#8221; were all <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/keith-urban-miley-cyrus-ashtray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered by other musicians</a>. Artists like Nina Simone, The Byrds, and Peter, Paul, and Mary recorded their own versions of Bob&#8217;s songs. </p>



<p>Aside from the studio albums, Bob has countless live records, bootlegs, compilations, and writing credits for other hits.</p>

<p>Bob was a major figure in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Many of his songs were considered protest anthems, and they spoke about the civil rights that people were fighting for. </p>



<p>Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221; and &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221; both expressed ideas about the civil rights movement and the fight against racism. Bob&#8217;s song &#8220;Only a Pawn in Their Game&#8221; is about the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers.</p>



<p>Perhaps most notably, Bob also performed at the 1963 March on Washington. He and fellow folk singer Joan Baez were both slated performers, per <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-dylan-only-a-pawn-in-their-game-1963-martin-luther-king-1011996/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a></em>. Bob&#8217;s four song set is not as well known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s famous &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech, which he delivered that day.</p>

<p>One of the most famous moments in Bob&#8217;s career, which is also featured in <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>was his 1965 performance at the Newport Folk Festival. </p>



<p>After making a name for himself as a folk musician (and acoustic performer), Bob shocked the crowd at the 1965 festival by performing with an electric guitar. He was met with outrage.</p>



<p>Bob only managed to play three songs, before he was booed off stage. Many folk fans felt that Bob was betraying his fanbase by performing with electric instruments. Some people had clearly thought he&#8217;d sold out.</p>



<p>Despite the controversy, many of the songs with electric instruments have since gone on to be classics. His first electric song &#8220;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#8221; is a beloved classic, and many of the tracks on <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> are regarded as classics, now.</p>

<p>Over the years, Bob has gotten to share the stage with tons of classic artists. Joan Baez was one of the biggest names that he performed with early in his career. Still, there are two bands that Bob is most often grouped with.</p>



<p>Most famously, Bob is associated with The Band. The classic rockers were already an established act, but Dylan recruited them to be his backing band beginning in 1966. Notably, Bob is the one who changed their name to The Band.</p>



<p>When The Band played their farewell concert <em>The Last Waltz </em>in 1976, Bob joined them for a few songs.</p>



<p>In the late 80s and early 90s, Bob was also a member of the Traveling Wilburys. The supergroup also included George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. They put out two albums together.</p>

<p>While plenty of artists slow down on the road as they get older, that&#8217;s not really the case for Bob. In June 1988, Bob set out on the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. Bob has been on the road consistently ever since. </p>



<p>He usually plays about 100 shows per year, and even though his 2021-2024 tour was dubbed the &#8220;Rough and Rowdy Ways&#8221; tour, many still consider it part of the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. </p>



<p>While many people will likely be interested in catching Bob after seeing <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, it is worth the warning that he does make significant changes to his songs live. Fans often complain about how difficult it can be to tell what songs he&#8217;s performing at recent concerts.</p>

<p>You might wanna turn away right about now, Anthony Mackie and Harrison Ford.</p>



<p>Marvel has released the fourth installment in a previously-beloved franchise &#8212; but, thus far at least, critics don&#8217;t exactly seem smitten with Captain America: Brave New World.</p>



<p>It marks Mackie&#8217;s first time taking on the lead and it features Harrison in the role of the President <em>and</em> the Red Hulk.</p>



<p>So&#8230; why all the negative reviews? Why aren&#8217;t movie critics putting up their shields and defending the film? Scroll down to find out&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>As with other Captain America content, this film attempts a taut political thriller. It works for the most part, though there’s some clunky dialogue and it bends over backwards to avoid being too political</strong>. &#8212; Fat Guys at the Movies</p>



<p><strong>It represents the MCU on autopilot, and while that means everything runs smoothly, it never goes anywhere particularly interesting. </strong>&#8212; Tom&#8217;s Guide</p>



<p><strong>I can&#8217;t believe at one time I complained about these Marvel movies having too many superheroes per movie because Brave New World feels empty with only one, especially one that could more easily die in any fight he&#8217;s in.</strong> &#8212; MullingMovies.com</p>



<p><strong>Anthony Mackie fights hard with his vibranium wings, but the Marvel magic didn’t take flight for this one. Marvel and Disney are still looking for that Brave New World. Maybe in the next one, it will magically appear.</strong> &#8212; Movies and Shakers</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="674" height="307" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/hq720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519370" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/hq720.jpg 674w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/hq720-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Anthony Mackie does all he can to save Captain America 4.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>For his part, Mackie is charismatic and has star power, though he still feels somewhat timid in the role, and he lacks the character moments to truly shine.</strong> &#8212; Detroit News</p>



<p><strong>For the MCU to make it back to their previous standing atop the blockbuster landscape, they’re going to have to deliver much more interesting characters and stories than are present in Captain America: Brave New World. </strong>&#8212; Culture Map</p>



<p><strong>Compared to some of the studio&#8217;s recent misfires, this new entry is at least passable.</strong> &#8212; Newsday</p>



<p><strong>We get a movie that, much like the MCU itself these days, is merely running on autopilot. Captain America may still stand for something, but Brave New World sure doesn’t.</strong> &#8212; Cinemaholics</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="322" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/2667-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519371" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/2667-copy.jpg 537w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/2667-copy-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Harrison Ford as the Red Hulk.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Brave New World is as visually lifeless as the most lifeless MCU thrillers, marred by needless overcutting, flimsy digital backdrops and stilted composition; thematically, it says nothing confidently and even less coherently.</strong> &#8212; Paste Magazine</p>



<p><strong>It’s been a long time since a Marvel movie felt like a building block with its own structural integrity. Even for its flaws, Captain America: Brave New World feels like the series may be finding its soul again. </strong>&#8212; Austin Chronicle</p>



<p><strong>What distinguishes “Captain America: Brave New World,” blissfully under two hours, is that action is kept to a relative minimum, and the actors are actually allowed to find and deepen their cardboard characters, including Danny Ramirez as Falcon</strong>. &#8212; San Francisco Chronicle</p>



<p><strong>Brave New World is a bunch of characters wandering around in search of meaning, the Marvel machine creaking loudly as it tries to whip up some grand mythos around these B-tier figures</strong>. &#8212; Vanity Fair</p>

<p>Game. Set. Match, Blake Lively?</p>



<p>While working on film It Ends With Us, Justin Baldoni seemingly sent his co-star a seven-minute voice memo about the movie&#8217;s iconic rooftop scene&#8230; which he said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-sues-blake-lively-for-defamation-seeks-400-million/">in a January 16 lawsuit</a> that Lively rewrote after he agreed to let her pitch a few changes.</p>



<p>Prior to filing his own lawsuit, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">Baldoni was accused by Lively of sexual harassment</a> on the set of their recent hit movie.</p>



<p>She alleged at the time that Baldoni created a hostile work environment on the movie’s set and later took part in a smear campaign against the Gossip Girl alum.</p>

<p>“Hey Blake, it’s 2 [a.m.] in the morning. Hopefully this does not wake you up. There is so much I want to say to you,” Baldoni begins in this just-released message, which <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/27/justin-baldoni-voice-message-apology-blake-lively/">TMZ obtained</a> in its entirety on Monday, January 27.</p>



<p>The actor, who also directed It Ends With Us, proceeded to pour out his feelings about his and Lively’s big screen adaption, saying, “I want to start with an apology&#8221; and adding:</p>



<p>“Man, reading the second part of your message, my heart sank. I’m really sorry. I for sure fell short and you worked really hard on that. The way you framed it and how it made you feel, I just wanted to say thank you for sharing that with me.”</p>

<p>Nor do we know the specific accusations to which Baldoni is responding here.</p>

<p>Baldoni noted he was “very grateful” that Lively felt “safe enough” to tell him her feelings about the project and her experience in Hollywood as a whole.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry. I f—ed up. That is a fail on my part,” Baldoni said. &#8220;One thing you should know about me, I will admit and apologize when I fail. I am far from perfect. I am a very flawed man as my wife will attest.”</p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/blake-lively-fires-back-accuses-justin-baldoni-of-inappropriate-touching/">Lively alleged that Baldoni touched her</a> against her will.</p>



<p>She also said he talked about intercourse with his wife in an odd and open manner, showed her pornographic material and generally kissed and cozied up to her in ways that were NOT in the movie&#8217;s script.</p>

<p>“I’m gonna f— up. I’m gonna say the wrong thing. I’m gonna put my foot in my mouth. I’m gonna say the wrong thing, probably. But I will always apologize and find my way back to center. That is one thing I can assure you of,&#8221; continued Baldoni in this apparent voice memo, which seems to confirm some of Lively&#8217;s allegations against him.</p>



<p>Baldoni then apologized again (&#8220;I’m sorry I made you feel that way. That must have felt terrible.&#8221;) and vowed:</p>



<p>&#8220;I will for sure do better. That was not my best weekend. I should’ve given it more time.”</p>

<p>About two weeks ago, Baldoni sued Lively and others for $400 million, stating for the legal record that she has defamed him and lied about him.</p>



<p>This may still be the case, we suppose.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in his voice memo, though, Baldoni apologized to Lively for &#8220;what you&#8217;ve been through with these other filmmakers,&#8221; calling them &#8220;f&#8211;kheads&#8221; and saying: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just still kind of blown away that this is the industry we&#8217;re in and that you&#8217;ve experienced that as a woman. Hopefully, it&#8217;s not been the experience with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The release of this voice memo coincided on Monday with  a federal judge ruling that Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively could be headed for a trial on March 9, 2026 in response to their legal filing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominees for the 97th Academy Awards</a> were announced today.</p>



<p>And as usual, the list contained some major surprises.</p>



<p>Some big names were snubbed, while other major talents received their very first nominations. </p>



<p>But the biggest shocker of all might have been the absolute dominance of <em>Emilia Perez.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emilia-perez-is-set-to-win-big-at-the-oscars">Emilia Perez Is Set to Win Big at the Oscars</h2>



<p>The French-produced Netflix film scored a whopping 13 nominations, making it tied for the second-most nods of all time.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s a several-way tie that includes such cinematic heavy-hitters as <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, <em>Forrest Gump</em>, and <em>Oppenheimer</em>.)</p>



<p>The film also received more noms than any other 2024 film by a considerable margin. <em>The Brutalist </em>and <em>Wicked</em> tied for second most with 10 nominations each.</p>

<p>So good news, right? The most nominated film of the year is an energetic musical that features such beloved stars as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/selena-gomez/page/2/">Selena Gomez</a> and Zoe Saldaña. </p>



<p>And it&#8217;s available on a streaming service you probably already subscribe to! What could be better?</p>



<p>Well, we hate to rain on your cinephile parade, but <em>Emilia Perez</em> has become a lightning rod for controversy in recent months, and not for the reasons you might expect.</p>



<p>The film tells the story of Manitas Del Monte, the fictional head of a Mexican drug cartel who undergoes gender-affirming surgery to become the title character.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="666" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1024x666.png" alt="Selena Gomez stars in the Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez." class="wp-image-517616" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1024x666.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-300x195.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-768x500.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-2048x1333.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-960x625.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1080x703.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1200x781.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez stars in the Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (age 114/Why Not Productions/Pathé Films/France 2 Cinéma)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s not the sort of premise one hears every day, and <em>Emilia Perez</em> deserves at least some credit for showcasing the kind of stories that are seldom seen in mainstream cinema.</p>



<p>But the film&#8217;s critics argue that it&#8217;s not doing so responsibly. At all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-criticisms-of-emilia-perez">The (Many) Criticisms of Emilia Perez</h2>



<p>For starters, French director Jacques Audiard has been widely criticized for hiring a mostly non-Mexican cast and crew, including several actors (including Selena) who are not fluent in Spanish. </p>



<p>Audiard does <em>not</em> speak Spanish himself, and when addressing concerns that he chose not to film in Mexico &#8212; or even to study Mexican culture before embarking on this project &#8212; he&#8217;s come off as glib and dismissive.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did Shakespeare need to go all the way to Verona to write a story about that place?&#8221; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250121-why-some-mexicans-are-criticising-oscar-tipped-emilia-perez">Audiard once asked his critics</a>.)</p>



<p>Given its storyline &#8212; which centers a number of hot-button social issues &#8212; you might assume that the film has been targeted by conservative groups who take issue with the its trans protagonist and drug-money-fueled storylines.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2192556222-683x1024.jpg" alt="Jacques Audiard attends the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.

<p>But in an ironic twist worthy of an Oscar-winning screenplay, the loudest complaints about <em>Emilia Perez</em> have mostly come from the progressive end of the political spectrum.</p>



<p>(In fairness, that might be a result of the fact that conservatives were less likely to be familiar with the ultra-niche film, a situation that may change as a result of today&#8217;s nominations.)</p>



<p>Those who might normally be inclined to praise the movie for its prominent representation of a trans character have instead been pointing out that 1. Said portrayal is not terribly nuanced or sensitive, and 2.  <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> &#8212; a film that offered a much more compassionate and insightful take on the trans experience &#8212; was snubbed by the Academy entirely.</p>



<p><a href="https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/">GLAAD</a> slammed the film as “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman”.</p>



<p>&#8220;Emilia Perez is a regressive movie that thinks it’s woke. It will probably win an Oscar,&#8221; <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/390998/emilia-perez-selena-gomez-oscars-green-book-crash-transgender-musical">Vox</a></em> lamented before comparing the film to <em>Crash</em>, another derided (and now largely forgotten) Oscar darling that scored big by playing on left-leaning sympathies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but EMILIA PEREZ getting 13 Oscar nominations is instantly one of the funniest things that has ever happened at the Oscars,&#8221; critic Sonny Bunch <a href="https://x.com/SonnyBunch/status/1882428799150931978">wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>&#8220;I can’t even wrap my head around ‘Emilia Pérez’ getting THIRTEEN (13!!!) #Oscars nominations. Quite possibly the worst movie ever (mid-scores from audiences &amp; critics) to get double digit nominations. Baffling,&#8221; echoed <a href="https://x.com/JeffDLowe/status/1882434456356835437">podcast host</a> Jeff D. Lowe.</p>



<p>Lowe added a clip of one of the film&#8217;s much-mocked musical sequences.</p>



<p>It serves as a reminder that in addition to the criticism it&#8217;s received from the Left, Emilia Perez is not a film that&#8217;s likely to appeal to the more centrist denizens of Middle America, either.</p>



<p>In other words, a big night Audiard and his cast might lead to some very low ratings for this year&#8217;s Oscars telecast.</p>

<p>It Ends With Us?</p>



<p>More like&#8230; it&#8217;s just <em>starting</em> between them.</p>



<p>As you may have already read about, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/blake-lively-actually-sues-justin-baldoni-for-sexual-harassment/">Blake Lively recently accused Justin Baldoni</a> of sexual harassment on the set of their recent hit movie; claiming her co-star created a hostile work environment on the film&#8217;s set and later took part in a smear campaign against his colleague.</p>



<p>And now Baldoni has fired back.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-508059" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-09-at-2.57.00-PM.webp 1360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It seems unlikely Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni will share the screen ever again.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Sony Pictures Releasing / courtesy Everett Collection)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Attorneys for the the 40-year old filed a $400 million lawsuit in the Southern District of New York on January 16 on behalf of Baldoni, producer Jamey Heath, publicist Jennifer Abel and crisis publicist Melissa Nathan.</p>



<p>Baldoni is now backing up his claim by releasing <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/21/justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-raw-footage-dance-scene-no-sexual-harassment-blake-lively/">unedited footage from the set of <em>It Ends With Us</em></a>. He claims the 10 minutes of video refute Lively&#8217;s claims of sexual harassment.</p>



<p>The footage provided shows the actors engaging in playful banter. But of course, they only depict one side of this srory.</p>



<p>Baldoni is taking legal action on allegations of civil extortion&#8230; defamation&#8230; false light invasion of privacy&#8230; breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing&#8230; intentional interference with contractual relations&#8230; intentional interference with prospective economic advantage&#8230; and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.</p>



<p>The actor also directed <em>It Ends With Us</em>.</p>



<p>He says in these documents that Lively was “determined to make Baldoni the real-life villain of her story,” and “falsified stories” of his sexual harassment, noting that the <em>Gossip Girl </em>alum’s damaged reputation following the release of this movie was “of her own making,” and NOT a smear campaign, as <em>her</em> lawsuit states.</p>

<p>Baldoni cites &#8220;disastrous misjudgments&#8221; made by Lively, who served as a producer on the film and who reportedly determined the flick&#8217;s final cut.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lively, working with her husband, her publicist, and Jones, among others, set out on a campaign to tar and feather Plaintiffs in the press,&#8221; reads the lawsuit.</p>



<p>&#8220;They conspired and worked in concert with the New York Times to put out a blockbuster news report as devastating as it was false.”</p>



<p>Lively, of course, is married to Ryan Reynolds.</p>



<p>The lawsuit even documents a meeting at Lively and Reynolds&#8217; New York City apartment awhile back during which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> popped in to applaud a re-write made by Lively on a scene in the movie.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Justin Baldoni at the It Ends With Us premiere on August 6, 2024." class="wp-image-515829" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0102_justinbaldoni_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Baldoni attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 06, 2024 in New York City. attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Cindy Ord/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Baldoni’s filing further claims that Lively “set out to destroy Plaintiffs’ livelihoods and businesses if they did not bend to her incessant demands, and when they refused to give way, she did exactly that, accusing them of foul and reprehensible sexual misconduct.”</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the lawsuit, Baldoni alleges that Lively “had a reputation of being difficult to work with,” and “almost immediately” began “inserting herself into the production process in intrusive ways well beyond the scope of her contractual entitlements.” </p>



<p>This included examples of Lively’s control over her character’s wardrobe and rewriting scripts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-to-blake-lively-stfu-you-bully/">Baldoni&#8217;s lawyer previously denied</a> the claims made against his client.</p>



<p>These claims include how Baldoni caused “severe emotional distress” to Lively as a result of his behavior on set… which included “showing nude videos or images of women to Blake,” along with discussion of Baldoni’s past “pornography addiction” or “sexual conquests.”</p>



<p>In a new statement, the aforementioned attorney says: </p>



<p>&#8220;This lawsuit is a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team’s duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret. </p>



<p>&#8220;Blake Lively was either severely misled by her team or intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the truth.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-1024x682.jpg" alt="Blake Lively in front of a giant It Ends With Us sign on August 8, 2024." class="wp-image-508016" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0827_blakelively_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Blake Lively attends the &#8220;It Ends With Us&#8221; UK Gala Screening at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on August 8, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for Sony Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This message concludes:</p>



<p><em>Let’s not forget, Ms. Lively and her team attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons through their own dangerous manipulation of the media before even taking any actual legal action. </em></p>



<p><em>We know the truth, and now the public does too.</em></p>



<p><em>Justin and his team have nothing to hide, documents do not lie.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Adele is ready to set fire to the screen! The British songstress&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/adele-cancels-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas residency </a>may be done, but she&#8217;s reportedly planning on releasing a concert film, documenting the shows.</p>



<p>The popstar&#8217;s &#8220;Weekends With Adele&#8221; concert series was<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/adele-lying-to-fans-about-canceled-vegas-residency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> one of the hottest tickets </a>in Sin City for two years, and now all of her fans will get to experience the magic.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an excellent decision for Adele to turn her recent concerts into a film and documentary. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/adeles-replacing-katy-perry-on-american-idol-rumor-has-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fellow popstars </a>Taylor Swift and Beyonce had hit films with their <em>Eras Tour </em>and <em>Renaissance </em>films, respectively.</p>

<p>While the &#8220;Someone Like You&#8221; singer has not shared any details about the film herself yet, here&#8217;s everything we know about the movie!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-adele-said-about-the-concert-film">What Has Adele Said About The Concert Film?</h2>



<p>Adele first shared the exciting news that she&#8217;d record her shows back in March of 2023. The singer told the crowd at one of her concerts that she&#8217;d booked some summer dates.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll be back for a few weeks in June, and I’m gonna film it and I’m gonna release it to make sure that anyone who wants to see this show can see it,&#8221; she said, per <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-extend-weekends-with-las-vegas-residency-release-concert-film-1234703875/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rolling Stone</em>. </a></p>

<p>Before announcing the film, Adele admitted &#8220;playing to 4,000 people for 34 nights is not enough.&#8221; She knew fans would want to see more.</p>



<p>While the fans who couldn&#8217;t make the shows are certainly excited, sources close to the singer also noted that she&#8217;s probably going to make a pretty penny off the movie.</p>



<p>An insider closer to the situation reported that Adele would likely earn about $60 million from the movie, according to<em> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/adele-rolling-cash-mega-film-30253934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Adele&#8217;s Vegas shows are not just a massive success critically and with fans, but also financially. And the film special is also going to bring in millions more &#8211; a sum greater than the show payments,&#8221; the source told the outlet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-songs-will-be-in-the-movie">What Songs Will Be In The Movie?</h2>



<p>The film hasn&#8217;t officially been announced yet, so the songs that will be featured are still not clear. The film will likely feature the standard setlist from most of the shows, although Adele did occasionally change things up.</p>



<p>The movie will reportedly be both a concert film and part documentary. It&#8217;s not clear what behind-the-scenes details or new insights Adele will have as part of the documentary.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Adele has announced a <a href="https://shop.adele.com/products/weekends-with-adele-live-in-las-vegas-box-set" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live album</a> from the concerts, which will be released in February. The three LP vinyl box set boasts 21 songs from the singer&#8217;s residency, and it seems likely that it will be a similar setlist for the movie.</p>



<p>The tracklist is as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hello</li>



<li>Easy On Me</li>



<li>Turning Tables</li>



<li>Take It All</li>



<li>I Drink Wine</li>



<li>Water Under the Bridge</li>



<li>Send My Love (To Your New Lover)</li>



<li>Oh My God</li>



<li>One and Only</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t You Remember</li>



<li>Rumour Has It</li>



<li>Skyfall</li>

<p><strong>How do I love the film of the hit stage musical, let me count the ways, starting with the way Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande set the screen ablaze as frenemy witches and sets, costumes and songs to die for. Seeing this joyous eruption once is not enough.</strong> &#8212; Peter Travers, ABC News</p>



<p><strong>This is a sumptuous and unsubtle treat grounded in Erivo’s graceful and subtle performance. When she defies gravity, she lifts us with her, and we lean forward to the next chapter.</strong> &#8212; Movie Mom</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Wicked&#8221; is the most entertaining film of the year and the most dazzling live-action Hollywood musical since “Chicago.” To put it in the kind of lingo used in Oz, I pronuncify it magnifical.</strong> &#8212; Wall Street Journal</p>



<p><strong><em>Cynthia Erivo&#8217;s impassioned performance is the most real thing in the artificial Oz of Jon M. Chu&#8217;s CGI-heavy &#8216;Wicked.&#8217;</em></strong> &#8212; Metro Weekly (Washington DC)</p>

<p><strong>There’s no denying that some people will be very, very happy with this. Others might find themselves wondering how something can be magical and meh at the same time.</strong> &#8212; The List</p>



<p><strong>Erivo and Grande deliver amazing performances in their respective roles as Elphaba and Galinda, capturing their characters&#8217; many facets and singing their hearts out. In terms of musical adaptations, Wicked exceeds all expectations</strong>. &#8212; 411 Mania</p>



<p><strong>Erivo brings a strong sense of dignity to Elphaba, while Grande proves she&#8217;s got comedic chops to go with those golden pipes. Jon M. Chu reaches new heights with this dazzling, vivid, and surprisingly heartfelt movie musical</strong>. &#8212; FlixChatter Film Blog</p>



<p><strong>Though the run time may seem excessive (two hours and 40 minutes?!), it is a testament to Chu and his team’s care that each musical number is carefully built up and celebrated with elaborate set pieces.</strong> &#8212; Little White Lies</p>

<p><strong>I did not care much for Wicked: Part One—I’m desperately tired of movies being one half of one movie, particularly when said movie has a run time of 160 minutes—but Ariana Grande delivers one of the best performances of the year as Glinda</strong>. &#8212; The Bulwark</p>



<p><strong>Radiant with combustible chemistry, Grande and Erivo play off each other with the testy flair of Olympic-class fencers</strong>. &#8212; Chicago Daily Herald</p>



<p><strong>Wicked isn’t really the vehicle to ponder deeper existential questions about the true nature of evil… It does, however, hit more than a few sweet spots for fellow misfits who see themselves in either Glinda or Elphaba.</strong> &#8212; Globe and Mail</p>



<p><strong>[Director John] Chu takes a stab at making a blockbuster for our times, one that doesn’t shy away from contending with the darkness of contemporary politics and society. Though Chu doesn’t always hit the mark, Wicked consistently dazzles.</strong> &#8212; Salon.com</p>

<p>Taylor Lautner has gone there, folks. </p>



<p>He really, truly has.</p>



<p>And now we may need to pray for the actor as a result.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="932" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1024x932.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513447" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1024x932.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-300x273.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-768x699.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-2048x1865.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-960x874.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1080x983.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1996899656-1200x1093.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Lautner attends the 13th annual NFL Honors at Resorts World Theatre on February 8, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This past Saturday, Lautner jumped on TikTok to take part in the latest viral trend… which features user making bold statements before &#8220;accidentally&#8221; turning the camera on themselves.</p>



<p>In his case, Lautner went WAY back in time, starting his footage with a look at the 2011 blockbuster The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 1, as it played on a flat-screen television and honed in on the scene where Bella Swan marries her vampire lover, Edward Cullen.</p>



<p>(Swan was played by Kristen Stewart and Cullen was played by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/robert-pattinson/">Robert Pattinson</a>, both of whom turned into enormous stars after taking on these beloved roles.)</p>



<p>Lautner &#8212; who portrayed Edward&#8217;s occasional rival, Jacob and who has gone on to star in Shark Boy and Lava Girl &#8212; wrote over the clip: </p>



<p>“Honestly screw Edward. Bella should have ended up with Jacob.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="570" height="928" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/taylor-lautner-suggests-twilight-shouldve-93849599.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513450" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/taylor-lautner-suggests-twilight-shouldve-93849599.webp 570w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/taylor-lautner-suggests-twilight-shouldve-93849599-184x300.webp 184w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (TikTok)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 32-year old then jokingly flipped the camera back on himself, acting shocked and afraid with the text “oh no no no” written on the screen.</p>



<p>He was obviously just having fun, but Lautner was also taking a chance because the Bella/Edward romance simply dominated pop culture back in the day.</p>



<p>Stewart and Pattinson became a couple while filming this franchise and loyal Twilight Saga fans engaged in plenty of debates at the time over just who Bella should have married.</p>



<p>We now know where Lautner stands.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513451" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1933571946-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Lautner reacts on the sideline prior to a game between the Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions in the NFC Wild Card Playoffs at Ford Field on January 14, 2024 in Detroit, Michigan. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Nic Antaya/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thankfully, Lautner earned praise for his joke, as nearly every user was well aware he was just kidding around. </p>



<p>“HE WON THIS TREND,&#8221; one person wrote in response, for example.</p>



<p>“This made my year,” another added.</p>



<p>Lautner starred as Jacob Black in the Twilight Saga from 2008 to 2012, earning massive praise and also many comparisons to Pattinson.</p>



<p>“We never really connected on a deep level just because we’re different humans,” Lauter said last year about his former co-star, explaining on the Call Her Daddy podcast that Pattinson is “fantastic” and “the sweetest person ever.”</p>
