<p>Amber Portwood has a long history of not taking accountability for her actions.</p>



<p>This history inevitably includes reactions of extreme outrage when anyone recalls her misdeeds. She feels that she is entitled to forgiveness, no matter what.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this means that watching <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/amber-portwoods-daughter-takes-steps-toward-being-adopted-by-kristina-shirley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leah</a> exclude her from her 16th birthday party and pass on her gift sent Amber into a rage spiral.</p>



<p>She may say that she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/amber-portwood-quit-teen-mom-allegedly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">done with <em>Teen Mom</em></a>, but she isn&#8217;t done watching and angrily reacting on social media.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-even-though-amber-portwood-says-that-she-s-done-with-teen-mom-she-s-still-tuning-in">Even though Amber Portwood says that she&#8217;s done with &#8216;Teen Mom,&#8217; she&#8217;s still tuning in</h2>



<p>Amber Portwood is still watching <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>, presumably so that at least <em>one </em>of the viewers will be sympathetic to Amber&#8217;s side of things.</p>



<p>This meant that she watched Leah celebrate turning 16. She celebrated this milestone birthday without Amber, whom she very understandably did not want there.</p>



<p>Leah discussed her &#8220;abandonment issues&#8221; dating back to age 8 (which barely scratches the surface on Amber&#8217;s whole deal). And she also rejected the gift and the card that Amber had sent over.</p>

<p>Faced with such a scene, many parents might express the guilt that they feel for having a child who has spent half of her life aware that their mom is not fully present in her life. </p>



<p>That &#8230; was not the emotional direction that Amber selected.</p>



<p>Taking to TikTok live, which is more or less always a mistake, Amber shared: “I’m feeling emotional right when it comes to what I just saw.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-those-aren-t-boundaries-is-not-a-good-way-to-respect-boundaries">&#8216;Those aren&#8217;t boundaries&#8217; is not a good way to respect boundaries</h2>



<p>One of the replies &#8212; again, this was live &#8212; noted that Leah Shirley had created some very valid boundaries for herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Amber spat in response. “Those aren’t boundaries. I’m her mother. It’s disrespect.”</p>



<p>Pretty famously, narcissists dislike boundaries because they represent a loss of control. </p>



<p>(One also has to ask &#8230; in what way does Amber believe that she deserves special levels of respect from anyone, let alone Leah?)</p>

<p>Amber continued her rant, demanding: “What? Did I beat her? Is that what I did? Is that what you’re saying.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well &#8230; in addition to physically assaulting <em>both </em>of her baby daddies, teen Amber is shown on camera encouraging Gary Shirley to hit the then-very-young Leah. (Gary did not respond positively to this demand)</p>



<p>It may also be worth noting that parenting is not the story of the Billy Goats Gruff. You don&#8217;t get a pass so long as there&#8217;s a worse parent &#8212; or a billion worse parents &#8212; out there.</p>



<p>“Nobody’s told me to be accountable, darling!” Amber raged on TikTok. “Did you do time in prison? Did you do my time in prison?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-see-no-one-understands-how-hard-leah-s-childhood-has-been-on-amber">See, no one understands how hard Leah&#8217;s childhood has been on Amber</h2>



<p>“Did you sit and talk with my daughter and sit down with her and let her know that you were an addict and everything that happened to you?” Amber&#8217;s rant went on. </p>



<p>“Were you … in my shoes when I had to sit there and go through everything I had to do?!&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Were you paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be in your children’s lives?”</p>



<p>Making a perhaps too-on-the-nose analogy, Amber insisted: “I’ve done nothing in my life, <em>darling</em>, then try to be in my daughter’s life and was pushed out like a cancer!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p> However, as you can see here, Amber eventually changed her tone in a follow-up <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thepinktea_/video/7487326350882114859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok Live</a> video.</p>



<p>“I didn’t see what her reaction was,” Amber said tearfully, having watched the scene where Leah rejects her gift and card. “It’s the only thing in my life, guys, that hurts me.&#8221; Clearly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just want to see my daughter,&#8221; Amber lamented. She continued: &#8220;It’s so hard. I don’t want to make this [Live] for anybody else.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Teen Mom: Family Reunion, Amber Portwood acknowledged that she&#8217;s not necessarily a &#8220;good mom.&#8221; Viewers and family court have clearly drawn similar conclusions over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teen-mom-fans-just-haven-t-seen-how-good-of-a-mom-she-s-been-in-secret">&#8216;Teen Mom&#8217; fans just haven&#8217;t seen how good of a mom she&#8217;s been (in secret)</h2>



<p>“I promise. My hand on the Bible, I did. [I was] consistent, I promise,” Amber insisted, claiming that she was a good mom in ways that viewers have never seen. She continued: “I did exactly what she wanted. I came when the cameras weren’t there, when she brought that up, I promise.&#8221;</p>



<p>She claimed: “I’ve got so many pictures and so many videos that I’ve never posted of us together. Just to keep her from not feeling embarrassed.”</p>



<p>Naturally, some of the commenters suggested to Amber that her emotionally volatile rants on social media might further alienate Leah. Amber was not inclined to take their advice. Perhaps that is for the best, for Leah&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>Amber Portwood says that she has quit <em>Teen Mom</em>.</p>



<p>Even though the <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> star has been open about not having a good time.</p>



<p>Viewers have seen her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/amber-portwood-pregnancy-scare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lie to producers</a> and then admit to it.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-amber-portwood-quit-teen-mom-for-real-this-time">Has Amber Portwood quit &#8216;Teen Mom&#8217; for real this time?</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Amber Portwood has been posting unending rants on TikTok. So much so that she received a temporary ban from the pernicious video platform after her comments about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/amber-portwood-leah-kristina-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Shirley</a>.</p>



<p>For better or for worse, she has been part of the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise since she made her <em>16 and Pregnant</em> debut in 2009.</p>



<p>Now, Amber claims that, earlier this week, she told the <em>Teen Mom</em> bigwigs that she&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>In particular, Amber Portwood seemed determine to quash reports that MTV has fired her.</p>



<p>“You’re not about to say that you’re dropping me when I quit [the show] three days ago!” she announced. “And I told the producer that.”</p>



<p>Amber then taunted: “…You think this is going to be easy, with me going, after what’s going on?” Amber continued. “You think I’m scared? Like, y’all know I ain’t got that kind of fear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They know that, not only do I not fear that, but I don’t care,&#8221; Amber Portwood insisted.</p>



<p>&#8220;How you gonna cancel somebody who doesn’t give a damn?&#8221; she asked, presumably rhetorically.</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re gonna cancel me? Because I already quit, so nice try guys,&#8221; Amber went on (and on). &#8220;Nice try. I already got ahold of my agent. &#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Obviously, given Amber Portwood&#8217;s history of atrocious and at times criminal behavior, a lot of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </em>viewers would not object to seeing her go.</p>



<p>A lot of people feel attached to Leah. Many felt done with Amber the <em>first </em>time that she violently attacked the father of her child. Even more felt the same way after the second incident with the second baby daddy.</p>



<p>It would be nice if MTV could continue to showcase Leah&#8217;s life, exactly as much as she likes, without delving into Amber&#8217;s role. After all, Amber has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/amber-portwoods-daughter-takes-steps-toward-being-adopted-by-kristina-shirley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very little to do with Leah</a> these days. And that is for the best, for Leah&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>However, even some of Amber&#8217;s most resolute critics worry about her. And not just because it&#8217;s unclear how she would make a living without reality television.</p>



<p>Some have pointed out that her nonstop ranting and the comments &#8212; in which she seems to feel unstoppable and doesn&#8217;t care which bridges she burns &#8212; seem like a manic episode. Amber has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.</p>



<p>If it helps, <em><a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/03/15/amber-portwood-says-she-quit-teen-mom-this-week-encourages-catelynn-lowell-to-leave-show-too-it-feels-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley</a></em> reports that there&#8217;s no evidence that Amber Portwood has quit. Rather, it looks like she&#8217;s actively trying to be fired. Her lack of an invitation to the Reunion that recorded in January shows that her efforts may be paying off.</p>

<p>Amber Portwood hasn&#8217;t always been the greatest mom.</p>



<p>In fact, there are many times when she&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-and-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-bizarre-disappearance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a downright terrible parent</a> &#8212; and many of them have been captured on camera.</p>



<p>That might be why Amber&#8217;s daughter, Leah, has decided that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/amber-portwood-leah-kristina-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she wants to be adopted by her stepmother, Kristina Shirley</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leah-hopes-to-legally-cut-ties-with-amber">Leah hopes to legally cut ties with Amber</h2>



<p>Leah doubled down on her decision during Thursday&#8217;s episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to be adopted because Kristina&#8217;s been there my whole life,&#8221; the 16-year-old said. &#8220;I just feel like it should be official. And it&#8217;s more than a piece of paper to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leah&#8217;s dad, Gary Shirley, didn&#8217;t discourage the idea, but he pointed out that the process would not be an easy one.</p>



<p>&#8220;If everything was to go smoothly, after filing paperwork, which you would have to sign some stuff, too, it could take three months,&#8221; he explained to his daughter. &#8220;If Amber contests, then it could take, like, a year. It could take longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we say something or do something, she might try to do stuff and make it harder,&#8221; responded Leah. &#8220;And by then it might take two years. And then at that point, there’s no point in even going through all the trouble for it. So, I don’t know. I’ll have to think about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, Leah will be a legal adult soon, so Amber could potentially thwart her efforts simply by dragging the process out. But Leah was not deterred by that possibility.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really want to do it,&#8221; she said during a confessional segment. &#8220;But I&#8217;m scared it would make Amber mad. I don&#8217;t like being mean to people.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to that conflict, Gary suggested that his teen daughter talk to a therapist in order to figure out &#8220;kind of see what would emotionally be best for you.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;I know that your mom loves you, but for some reason she doesn’t know how to show it. But I want you to know that we’re here to help you and to be with you. I’m what you call your ride or die,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Gary went on to reveal that Amber &#8220;is not really involved,&#8221; claiming that &#8220;in the past year, she has seen her daughter four days.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leah&#8217;s going to weigh her options, talk to her therapist and decide what route she wants to go,&#8221; Kristina said of the situation. &#8220;I will do whatever she wants. Nothing will change the way that I love that girl.&#8221;</p>

But we don&#8217;t yet know what she thinks about Leah&#8217;s steps toward being adopted.</p>



<p>Portwood has reportedly been <a href="https://www.instagram.com/teenmomshaderoom__/p/DHD2RiJuy_c/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned by TikTok</a> after haranguing Gary on the platform, which might be why she has yet to sound off on these latest developments.</p>



<p>But knowing Amber, you can bet she won&#8217;t remain silent for very long.</p>

<p>Amber Portwood had a pregnancy scare.</p>



<p>But, as it turns out, she wasn&#8217;t the one who felt worried. Producers were the ones who got spooked.</p>



<p>Though she is at times reluctant to do so, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/amber-portwood-claims-gary-shirley-is-forcing-her-to-appear-on-teen-mom-begs-fans-to-stop-watching-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber continues</a> to appear on <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>.</p>



<p>Which is why she ended up confessing to lying, on camera. But, as usual, Amber seems reluctant to accept the blame.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amber-portwood-kind-of-ghosted-gary-shirley">Amber Portwood kind of ghosted Gary Shirley</h2>



<p>During Tuesday&#8217;s episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em> (this portion of the season&#8217;s ratings are looking <em>rough</em>, by the way), Leah Shirley reached a major milestone.</p>



<p>Ahead of her sixteenth birthday, she received a car as a present. This isn&#8217;t a reckless choice. Gary and Kristina clearly felt that she could handle it, especially since she got her learner&#8217;s permit.</p>



<p>Amber Portwood had (once again) gone silent when her ex had reached out. So, Gary Shirley didn&#8217;t feel a major obligation to clear this with Leah. (Also, fortunately for Leah, he has custody)</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve messaged Amber a few times, no reply,&#8221; Gary Shirley lamented about Amber Portwood all but ghosting him.</p>



<p>&#8220;A person with bipolar disorder, there&#8217;s up and downs,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;And when she&#8217;s up, she&#8217;s feeling good. She might think everything&#8217;s perfect and want things a certain way. Like, &#8216;Oh, I really am sorry, but now I want you to instantly forgive me for years and years of abandonment.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Gary reasoned: &#8220;It [doesn&#8217;t] work that way. I want Leah to have a relationship with her mother … but at this point, it&#8217;s really not even enough to feel like it&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meanwhile-amber-portwood-had-a-pregnancy-scare">Meanwhile, Amber Portwood had a pregnancy scare</h2>



<p>Later in the episode, we saw a production crew show up at Amber&#8217;s home. Instead of showing her seated on a couch, we saw Amber refusing to open the door. At that point, she asked a producer to bring her a pregnancy test.</p>



<p>Amber refused to film, but her &#8220;private&#8221; conversation with a producer provided plenty of audio.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m freaking out. Can we just do this tomorrow before I cry and go sit in the corner? Don&#8217;t want all of them in here,&#8221; she said. </p>

<p>When asked if she might be pregnant, Amber Portwood admitted: &#8220;It&#8217;s possible. It was an ex.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;I&#8217;m freaked out right now. I&#8217;m scared. Just pray for me that I wasn&#8217;t too much of jackass.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite Amber&#8217;s alleged desperation, she ended up not taking the pregnancy test. And she told the production just that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-she-didn-t-really-have-a-pregnancy-scare">So she didn&#8217;t really have a pregnancy scare?</h2>



<p>&#8220;No, sorry. There&#8217;s been many times in my life where I&#8217;ve had to lie in order to get out of doing things because I&#8217;m not able to get ready, get dressed, move around, do anything,&#8221; Amber Portwood said.</p>



<p>&#8220;You just lie to people and say, &#8216;I&#8217;m busy, I have this sickness,&#8217; you want to make up something,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;To where they&#8217;re like, &#8216;We&#8217;re not going to do anything,&#8217; &#8216;You don’t have to film.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amber then announced that she was not pregnant. She added: &#8220;When you start lying in order to be alone, that&#8217;s me in the darkest.&#8221;</p>

<p>As is often the case with Amber Portwood, she seemed to direct blame away from herself. In this case, the root cause of her lie seemed to be <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ex-fiance Gary Wayt</a>, his temporary disappearance, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-and-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-bizarre-disappearance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their breakup</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more than heartbroken,&#8221; she expressed. &#8220;I&#8217;m f&#8211;ked up from what he did to me. We&#8217;re talking trauma.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amber also took aim at Leah&#8217;s understandable disinterest in a mother-daughter relationship. &#8220;With my daughter, she doesn&#8217;t want to be around me. I&#8217;m understanding right now that I don&#8217;t have a choice. &#8220;Trying to figure out how I&#8217;m gonna wait for my daughter and not be a horrifically depressed person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amber Portwood has leveled some shocking allegations against the father of her eldest child.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/amber-portwood-quits-teen-mom-will-soon-flip-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber has quit the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise</a> multiple times amid a wide array of legal and mental health issues.</p>



<p>Now, she says she was essentially <em>forced</em> to appear on the new season of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </em>after being blackmailed by Gary Shirley.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-allegations-against-gary">The Allegations Against Gary</h2>



<p>The latest drama in Amber&#8217;s life began back on Christmas Eve, when she railed against Gary in TikTok Live tirade.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/12/24/amber-portwood-makes-shocking-claims-against-gary-shirley-during-late-night-tiktok-meltdown-accuses-him-of-rape-more-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a> first reported, Amber referred to Gary as &#8220;a rapist,&#8221; seemingly alleging that he committed statutory rape at the start of their relationship.</p>



<p>Following a six-week hiatus, Amber returned to TikTok Live over the weekend, this time accusing Gary of lying and blackmail.</p>

<p>She also claimed that she only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-new-boyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to the<em> Teen Mom</em> franchise</a> because Gary begged her to.</p>



<p>“Guys, I left the show twice and was completely broke. I knew I wasn’t going to have the money … I came back, yes, but … I was begged by a person who said they needed the money. I’m gonna take care of my f&#8211;king daughter. What would you guys do?” Amber said, according to <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/02/02/amber-portwood-claims-gary-shirley-is-blackmailing-her-encourages-fans-to-stop-watching-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley</a>.</p>



<p>She also alleged that Gary begged her for “months” to return to filming.</p>



<p>“I came back for my daughter, just to have [Gary] lie on me on everything, after I did [the show again] just so [Gary and Kristina] weren’t losing their s&#8211;t,” Amber said. </p>



<p>“I feel so defeated, knowing how much I sacrificed my privacy. I feel really, really defeated. …I’m so sad that people think of me the way they do, and it’s all because of one man– just one man!— who lied out of his f&#8211;king teeth. Just one, that’s all it took.”</p>

<p>Amber also claimed that Gary used her mental illnesses as leverage against her.</p>



<p>“And he’s still doing it. I’m getting blackmailed right now guys. Literally. That’s why I’m not seeing my daughter…”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amber-lashes-out-at-mtv-teen-mom-producers">Amber Lashes Out at MTV, &#8216;Teen Mom&#8217; Producers</h2>



<p>From there, Amber accused <em>Teen Mom</em> producers of defaming her through deceptive editing techniques.</p>



<p>And then she urged her followers to stop watching the show.</p>

<p>“I guess you do watch some bulls&#8211;t version of me…Stop watching it then,” Amber said.</p>



<p>“Stop watching it. I would never advocate for something that shows somebody I don’t even like or know. They let [Gary] talk, talk and talk, and why do you think it is? It’s better TV guys. People want to hate me.”</p>



<p>Amber acknowledged the fact that she&#8217;s contractually obligated to promote the show, which means that encouraging people <em>not</em> to watch could create legal problems for her.</p>



<p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen but I know I’m not going to portray where people are saying lies about what I’ve done as a mom. I think it’s really messed up…” she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either I’m going to be respected for giving half of my life and my soul or I don’t f&#8211;king want anything. Guys, there’s a reason why I left [the show] twice, and I’m telling you, I was broke,&#8221; Portwood continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew I was going to be broke. But I wasn’t scared…I wasn’t going to let that man [Gary] keep using me for money as I wasn’t seeing my daughter and all this crazy stuff…&#8221;</p>



<p>Gary says Amber has not seen daughter Leah in over eight months, but she says he&#8217;s lying about that, as well.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>On this week&#8217;s season finale of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Amber Portwood learned an important truth.</p>



<p>And tried to send an important message to anyone watching.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="691" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1024x691.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509304" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-768x518.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-960x648.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1080x729.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy-1200x810.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-06-26-at-10-22-44-am-copy.jpg 1665w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood does not look too happy in this photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you might recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">Portwood got engaged to a man named Gary Wayt</a> this past June.</p>



<p>Days later, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/">Wayt disappeared</a>.</p>



<p>Gary was finally discovered days later, thankfully in fine physical condition, only for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-and-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-bizarre-disappearance/">him and Portwood to call off their engagement</a>.</p>



<p>What the heck happened to cause such tension and such a scandal?</p>



<p>Portwood shed some light on events during this episode of the MTV reality show.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="613" height="413" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/86678229-13578183-image-m-2_1719539578480-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-509305" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/86678229-13578183-image-m-2_1719539578480-copy.jpg 613w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/86678229-13578183-image-m-2_1719539578480-copy-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood during an episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I guess his dad read my Wikipedia,&#8221; Amber told a producer on the finale&#8230; before a screen capture of her sordid past flasheed across the screen, highlighting her run-ins with the law, along with her abusive history with ex <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/gary-shirley/">Gary Shirley</a>, with whom she shares 15-year-old daughter, Leah.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he was holding in the fact that he maybe heard from his family or something, and not telling me,&#8221; she continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was just saying, &#8216;I can&#8217;t do this. How can we get married then if your family can&#8217;t accept me?&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;And maybe he took that as me breaking up with him. It seemed like, to me, that maybe he was upset and like, hopeless.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="495" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood, a photo" class="wp-image-502759" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood-300x232.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood remains a significant player in the Teen Mom universe.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Amber actually learned on air that Gary had been found, although she then realized that he had not reached out to her afterward.</p>



<p>The mother of two considered this to be a pretty major &#8220;red flag.&#8221;</p>



<p>From there, Portwood headed to her psychiatrist, saying in the Uber ride over there of Wayt:</p>



<p>&#8220;Right now this man broke me&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was stable. And right now, this was the first time in years in my life &#8212; I am 34 &#8212; I am not f-cking right because a man put a ring on my finger.</p>



<p>&#8220;You broke me because we were actually in love. The day that man left, for no reason. And I&#8217;ma say no reason because there was no f-cking reason, and he ruined something so f-cking good. I am f-cking broken right now.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="861" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood makes a face" class="wp-image-502284" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-768x646.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-960x808.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1080x908.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1200x1009.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f.jpg 1272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has an unusual look on her face in this scene from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t just Gary that broke her, either.</p>



<p>Portwood delved into some of the responses she saw on social media to his vanishing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know how that feels when people are calling you a murderer to your f-cking fiancé?&#8221; Portwood screamed. &#8220;Do you know how that f-cking feels? He doesn&#8217;t know what he did! They were calling me a murderer and they said I f-cking killed him!&#8221;</p>



<p>The finale ended with the couple ending its engagement.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you wanna show what heartbreak is, this is it,&#8221; Amber concluded. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about a man. We had something better than we both have even seen in our lives with other people. </p>



<p>&#8220;He looked at my family, my daughter and just asked to be a big, happy family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amber Portwood doesn&#8217;t sound keen on the idea of anyone adopting Leah &#8212; even the woman who&#8217;s raised her.</p>



<p>Both on MTV and off camera, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-and-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-bizarre-disappearance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Portwood&#8217;s life is a mess</a>.</p>



<p>The longtime <em>Teen Mom</em> villain found new humiliation after a recent episode featured her eldest, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/gary-shirley-and-amber-portwood-support-leah-going-on-birth-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leah</a>, expressing an interest in a formal adoption by her father&#8217;s wife.</p>



<p>Amber doesn&#8217;t exactly have a reputation for rational or reasonable reactions. How&#8217;s she handling this?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On MTV, Amber Portwood openly vowed to no longer use her mental illness as an excuse for abhorrent behavior. Fans aren&#8217;t sure if she&#8217;s kept her promise.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leah-shirley-would-love-for-kristina-to-formally-adopt-her">Leah Shirley would love for Kristina to formally adopt her</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, July 18 episode of <em>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</em>, Gary Shirley opened up about 15-year-old Leah Shirley&#8217;s goals.</p>



<p>According to him, she &#8220;wants to be adopted&#8221; by Kristina Shirley.</p>



<p>Gary and Kristina have been together for a long time. Kristina is a mother to her. And, unlike Amber, Kristina seems to be a stable, compassionate, and decent human being.</p>

<p>Gary went on to describe Kristina as &#8220;the best thing that ever happened to Leah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, Gary is a bit biased. Kristina is his wife. They are a parenting team with their kids, including Leah.</p>



<p>But a bias doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;s wrong. Amber is a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/amber-portwood-completes-probation-thats-the-last-time-i-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstrably horrible person</a> and clearly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/andrew-glennon-claims-amber-portwood-bloodied-sons-lip-refused-to-bathe-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a good parent</a>. She set a very low bar, and Kristina has been there for Leah for <em>years</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-amber-portwood-feel-about-that">How does Amber Portwood feel about that?</h2>



<p>According to what an inside source tells <em>Us Weekly</em>, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-wouldnt-support-gary-shirleys-wife-adopting-leah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Portwood feels</a> &#8220;devastated&#8221; that Leah would welcome an adoption by Kristina.</p>



<p>“Obviously, any implication that her daughter wants to be adopted is devastating to Amber,” the insider dished.</p>



<p>“Her two kids are the reason Amber wakes up in the morning,&#8221; the source claimed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Teen Mom: Family Reunion, Amber Portwood acknowledged that she&#8217;s not necessarily a &#8220;good mom.&#8221; Viewers and family court have clearly drawn similar conclusions over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The insider, who seems to be very sympathetic to Amber Portwood and her feelings, continued to discuss her children.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are why she continues filming the show,&#8221; the source insisted.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the insider added of her children, they are &#8220;her motivation for everything.”</p>

<p>“Amber often gets misunderstood because she puts up such a tough front and people think she is so strong,&#8221; the insider claimed. &#8220;But she’s actually quite sensitive.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source complained: &#8220;This has not been an easy time for Amber on top of dealing with her mental health, which she has been very open about.”</p>

<p>Welp.</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t last long.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">Amber Portwood got engaged to Gary Wayt</a>, we can now confirm the following:</p>



<p>Amber Portwood is no longer engaged to Gary Wayt.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="495" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood, a photo" class="wp-image-502759" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Amber_Portwood-300x232.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood remains a significant player in the Teen Mom universe.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>An insider tells Us Weekly that the veteran Teen Mom star has ended her relationship with her short-term fiance in the wake of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/">Wayt disappearing for several days</a>.</p>



<p>“They’ve decided that it’s over between them and their engagement is off,” a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-fiance-gary-wayt-end-engagement-after-his-disappearance/">source told this tabloid</a> late Tuesday, adding of Amber and Gary: </p>



<p>“They have too much to overcome to move forward together.”</p>



<p>The anonymous mole said there has “been some closure” for the MTV personality, emphasizing that the former lovers have communicated and Wayt is “not ghosting her.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="861" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood makes a face" class="wp-image-502284" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-768x646.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-960x808.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1080x908.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1200x1009.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f.jpg 1272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has an unusual look on her face in this scene from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not long after the public learned of Portwood&#8217;s engagement, we also learned that Amber and Gary got into some kind of argument while attending Amber&#8217;s brother&#8217;s wedding in North Carolina.</p>



<p>Wayt then vanished.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am worried&#8230; He is a missing person right now,&#8221; Portwood told social media followers at the time.</p>



<p>“Nobody has found or heard from him yet. I’m trying my best to not think the worst. I have not ate [sic] in three days. I slept maybe an hour.”</p>



<p>The Bryson City Police Department confirmed via Facebook that Gary was missing and later confirmed he had been found.</p>



<p>No other details were made available, however.</p>

<p>Portwood herself has not yet confirmed that her engagement is over. However&#8230;</p>



<p>“Amber took off the engagement ring and it’s the best thing,” the insider went on to Us Weekly. </p>



<p>“She is sad and she cares about him, but she is willing to see that he is not the right guy for her. She wants to be with someone who accepts her fully.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/">Portwood was arrested in 2019 for domestic violence </a>and has had run-ins with the law on numerous occasions; she doesn&#8217;t have custody of her son as a result.</p>



<p>This history appears to have also played a role in the break-up.</p>

<p>“Gary’s family was looking her up online and looking at her past and not everything they saw online was true,” the insider continues. “And it was hard for Amber because she’s been trying so hard to move past it and move forward.”</p>



<p>Amber was previously engaged to Matt Baier and then to Gary Shirley, never making it down the aisle either time.</p>



<p>She shares five-year old son James with ex Andrew Glennon and 15-year old daughter Leah with Shirley.</p>



<p>Back in January, a source said that Portwood and Wayt had been seeing each other after connecting on a dating app months earlier. </p>



<p>“They are taking their time getting to know each other, but it’s getting serious,” this person said back then.</p>

<p>First, the good news about Gary Wayt:</p>



<p>He&#8217;s been found, alive and presumably well.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/">Amber Portwood reported that her fiance had gone missing</a> in North Carolina after the couple got into some kind of argument.</p>



<p>Local authorities have since confirmed, however, that Gary is safe and sound.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="861" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood makes a face" class="wp-image-502284" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-300x252.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-768x646.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-960x808.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1080x908.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f-1200x1009.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/f.jpg 1272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has an unusual look on her face in this scene from a Teen Mom episode.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, for the bad news when it comes to Gary Wayt:</p>



<p>He sort of has a sketchy past.</p>



<p>According to documents obtained by In Touch Weekly, <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/teen-mom-star-amber-portwoods-fiance-garys-criminal-history/">Wayt has been in trouble</a> with the law on multiple occasions. </p>



<p>For example, the 39-year old pleaded guilty and was convicted of illegal consumption of alcohol in 2005 in the state of Indiana.</p>



<p>One year later, Wayt was charged with possession of marijuana. </p>



<p>The new MTV star requested to have the charges expunged for both incidents in 2014&#8230; but the court refused, instructing Wayt to submit a <em>separate</em> petition along with payment.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1005" height="540" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335.webp" alt="Amber Portwood on an episode of MTV's Teen Mom." class="wp-image-501864" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335.webp 1005w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335-300x161.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335-768x413.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000907674335-960x516.webp 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood on an episode of MTV&#8217;s Teen Mom.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Along with these criminal charges, Wayt has been involved in a number of driving incidents. </p>



<p>Also in 2006, Gary was caught driving with a suspended license, eventually pleading guilty to the charge and earning a fine of $1,000.</p>



<p>Two years later, Wayt was caught speeding &#8212; twice. </p>



<p>From 2010 to 2017, Wayt faced <em>additional</em> charges varying from expired plates and speeding to disregarding a stop sign.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="445" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1.jpg" alt="Amber Portwood picture" class="wp-image-501505" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/Teen-Mom-Amber-Portwood-8922-800x445-1-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amber Portwood has had her share of legal trouble over the years.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Portwood, of course, has also had numerous run-ins with the law, most notably <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/">getting arrested in 2019</a> for allegedly attacking her ex-boyfriend with a machete.</p>



<p>She was previously engaged to Matt Baier, although the two never made it down the aisle.</p>



<p>Wayt, however, actually <em>has</em> been married once before.</p>



<p>He exchanged vows on July 21, 2013 with a woman named Caitlin Haynie … who filed for divorce from her husband in 2016.</p>



<p>They had no kids together and the marriage was officially dissolved on June 7, 2016, as the exes divided property amongst themselves and she kept the lease on their marital home. </p>



<p>The pair did not have any shared vehicles or debt amid the marriage.</p>

<p>Portwood went public with her latest romance this past fall and then introduced Gary t to fans during the June 6 episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.</p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-engaged-to-some-dude-named-gary/">got engaged a few weeks ago</a>.</p>



<p>“She’s really, really happy,” a Us Weekly source told the tabloid upon breaking this exciting piece of news, adding:</p>



<p>“They’ve been in couple’s therapy and talk about everything. They’re being very proactive in their relationship and are doing the work to prevent problems before they start.”</p>



<p>This was before the aforementioned fight and subsequent disappearance, but hopefully all hope is not lost for Amber Portwood and Gary </p>



<p>“This new man in her life has actually never seen Teen Mom so she feels she can finally date in the way she’s always wanted to,&#8221; Us Weekly added this month.</p>

<p>Amber Portwood&#8217;s new man was still missing, despite being spotted in video footage far from his North Carolina home, up until a few hours ago. </p>



<p>Nearly a week after the <em>Teen Mom </em>star alerted the police to her missing loved one, officials have released an update on their investigation. </p>



<p>Turns out, they found Gary Wayt, only to have lost him again &#8211; but now he has been found!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amber-portwood-s-missing-fiance-found-spotted-900-miles-away-from-home">Amber Portwood&#8217;s Missing Fiancé Found: Spotted 900 Miles Away From Home </h2>



<p>Now, this story has become a bit confusing, but here&#8217;s the latest that we can share. </p>



<p>On June 11, MTV star Amber Portwood  reported her fiancé <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-please-pray-for-my-missing-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Wayt missing</a> in North Carolina.</p>



<p>On that same day, footage was taken of Gary placing him 900 miles away from his NC resident. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.etonline.com/amber-portwoods-missing-fiance-gary-wayt-spotted-in-oklahoma-227425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement to <em>ET</em></a><em>,</em> a spokesperson for the Bryson City Police Department in North Carolina explained, &#8220;Gary was seen on camera in a Verizon store in Oklahoma&#8221; on June 11. From there, &#8220;it seems he headed toward New Mexico when the tag readers picked up his car there,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>But seeing Gary is not the same as Gary being found. The spokesperson explained that while they have information of Gary being in &#8220;New Mexico at one point&#8221; after June 11th, they have no more information on where he is now. </p>



<p>As such, &#8220;Gary will stay as a missing person until he contacts Bryson City Police or contacts another law enforcement officer,&#8221; the spokesperson said. </p>



<p>But then a few hours later, police shared via Facebook that Gary had been &#8220;located&#8221; and the case had been &#8220;closed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amber, meanwhile, has not confirmed that he&#8217;s back in NC.  </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On MTV, Amber Portwood openly vowed to no longer use her mental illness as an excuse for abhorrent behavior. Fans aren&#8217;t sure if she&#8217;s kept her promise.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-gary-missing-or-just-leaving-amber">Is Gary Missing Or Just Leaving Amber?</h2>



<p>“Amber stated she and Gary were having an argument and Gary picked up his car keys and wallet and walked out the door and drove off in a 2009 Nissan Rouge gray in color,” a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/11610232/amber-portwood-cops-gary-wayt-argued-missing-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>&nbsp;the police gave to reporters read.</p>



<p>While Amber is &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/amber-portwood-fiance-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devastated</a>,&#8221; it remains unclear what the pair fought about and why he&#8217;s been unreachable ever since. Reportedly, he has not spoken to Amber or any member of his family since he left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this likely means he&#8217;s turned himself in to police to call of the search. Glad to know he&#8217;s ok, but this story is far from over. </p>
