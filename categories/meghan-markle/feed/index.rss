<p>Meghan Markle has released the first episode of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-podcast-trailer-released-lets-do-this-ladies/">her new podcast</a>, opening up on the platform about something very personal and very painful.</p>



<p>Talking to Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, the Duchess of Sussex revealed that both she and her guest experienced postpartum preeclampsia&#8230; a unique and potentially life-threatening condition marked by high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine shortly after giving birth.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522948" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex pose for a photo at Centro Nacional de las Artes Delia Zapata during a visit to Colombia on August 15, 2024 in Bogota, Colombia. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Diego Cuevas/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We both had very similar experiences — though we didn&#8217;t know each other at the time — with postpartum, and we both had preeclampsia. Postpartum preeclampsia,&#8221; Markle said on air.</p>



<p>The former actress has two kids with Prince Harry: son, Prince Archie, 5; and daughter, Princess Lilibet, 3.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when the aforementioned condition hit her.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s so rare and so scary,&#8221; Markle continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re still trying to juggle all of these things, and the world doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening quietly. And in the quiet, you&#8217;re still trying to show up for people – mostly for your children — but those things are huge medical scares.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle isn&#8217;t receiving rave reviews for her Netflix series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Wolfe Herd agreed, saying the condition is &#8220;life or death, truly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Markle talked about the Royal Family tradition of introducing a newborn to the world pretty much immediately; just as Princess Diana and Kate Middleton did previously, Markle stood outside with two-day old Archie back in May 2019.</p>



<p>In front of the media and millions watching around the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could barely face a doorbell delivery for takeout food in a robe,&#8221; Wolfe Herd said, prompting a laugh from Meghan.</p>

<p>Markle is a busy woman these days, hosting this new podcast and also a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/">Netflix show everyone hates</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I do love the most about having young kids, in this chapter while I&#8217;m building [business], is the perspective that it brings because you&#8217;re building something while your child&#8217;s going through potty training…and both are just as important,&#8221; she said on this episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like, ‘Great, okay, where&#8217;s the Cheerios? Well done.’</p>



<p>&#8220;And then you&#8217;re championing your team 10 minutes later about something that is really high value for the world. In your own world, that&#8217;s super high value. And in [Lili’s] world, that&#8217;s super high value.&#8221;</p>



<p>Markle has often been accused of acting and sound unrelatable. But plenty of women are likely nodding their heads to this description of how life can be.</p>

<p>Markle and Lemonada Media announced on March 13 that her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, would focus on her entrepreneurial journey launching the As ever lifestyle brand (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-finally-launches-as-ever-entire-inventory-sells-out-immediately/">which sold out its first batch</a> of products last week) and feature honest conversations with fellow female founders over eight installments.</p>



<p>Wrote the polarizing star via Instagram at the time:</p>



<p><em>I’ve been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities, and scaled small ideas into massively successful businesses. They’re opening up, sharing their tips, tricks (and tumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build out my own business, As ever. I</em></p>



<p><em>t has been absolutely eye-opening, inspiring…and fun! (Because what’s the point if we can’t have some fun on this wild adventure?)</em></p>

<p>These days, Meghan Markle is making a name for herself as a lifestyle guru.</p>



<p>That means tirelessly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-finally-launches-as-ever-entire-inventory-sells-out-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoting her new brand, As Ever</a>, by whatever means necessary.</p>



<p>Given that the brand focuses on home life, it&#8217;s not surprising that Meghan&#8217;s two young children have cropped up in some of her promotional materials.</p>



<p>But while the move might make sense, it seems that Meg&#8217;s husband, Prince Harry, still isn&#8217;t happy about it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-and-harry-clashing-over-kids-exposure">Meghan and Harry: Clashing over kids&#8217; exposure?</h2>



<p>While she keeps their faces concealed, Meghan has featured her kids in multiple social media posts designed to drum up publicity for her latest venture.</p>



<p>And one royal expert believes that Harry is not thrilled with that decision.</p>



<p>“Harry is probably not overly happy,” Matt Wilkinson, royal editor at <em>The Sun,</em> said on his podcast this week (via <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/06/royal-family/prince-harry-not-overly-happy-with-meghan-markle-using-kids-to-promote-brand-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>).</p>



<p>“My understanding of this is that up to a certain stage Harry would much rather his children were not seen,” Wilkinson added.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1024x683.jpg" alt='Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex speak on stage at the "Friends @ Home Event" at the Station Airport during day three of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 12, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany.' class="wp-image-522867" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex speak on stage at the &#8220;Friends @ Home Event&#8221; at the Station Airport during day three of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 12, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-harry-and-meghan-have-differing-views-on-privacy">Do Harry and Meghan have differing views on privacy?</h2>



<p>Indeed, Harry&#8217;s devotion to his kids&#8217; privacy is the stuff of legend.</p>



<p>That makes sense, of course, considering the ways in which his own childhood has destroyed by media intrusions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/prince-harry-settles-hacking-suit-against-the-sun-tabloid-apologizes-for-harassing-princess-diana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry has sued tabloids</a> and gone to other great lengths in order to ensure that his son and daughter are permitted at least a modicum of normalcy.</p>



<p>And according to Wilkinson, Meghan is simply not as concerned with the issue.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want them to be [photographed]. He’s got this idea that if he takes them outside of Montecito, that there is a hoard of us out there trying to take photos of his kids,&#8221; Wilkinson explained.</p>



<p>“Meghan grew up in California, she once said she would like to have a more California-style lifestyle, take them down the beach, go out, do stuff,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>“She doesn’t want to hide them away.”</p>



<p>To be fair, Meghan is generally pretty protective of her kids&#8217; privacy.</p>

<p>But on the whole, she does seem less worried about the media than Harry is.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s a matter that they&#8217;ve discussed in detail, and despite Wilkinson&#8217;s speculation, we&#8217;re sure that Harry approved of the kids&#8217; involvement in Meghan&#8217;s recent social media posts.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s an issue that will only become more complex as the Archie and Lilibet get older.</p>



<p>And Harry and Meghan won&#8217;t be able to hide their faces forever.</p>

<p>The big day is finally here!</p>



<p>After months of planning and a few unexpected setbacks, Meghan Markle has finally launched <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-called-out-by-clothing-designer-over-as-ever-brand-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her lifestyle brand, As Ever</a>.</p>



<p>Products went on sale today via the As Ever website, and not surprisingly, everything is already sold out.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle isn&#8217;t receiving rave reviews for her Netflix series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-markle-s-new-products-sell-out-instantaneously">Meghan Markle&#8217;s new products sell out instantaneously</h2>



<p>There are only a handful of items available at the moment: some jams, teas, and batter mixes for making crepes and cookies.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, they all sold out within hours of the site&#8217;s launch.</p>



<p>According to a press release that appeared on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-announces-as-evers-first-collection-will-be-available-for-purchase-today-302418248.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR Newswire</a>, Meghan&#8217;s highly anticipated brand was rolled out “in partnership with Netflix’s CPG division&#8221; and “products will be available to ship nationwide across all 50 states with plans to expand globally.”</p>



<p>To promote her new wares, Meghan gave an in-depth interview to the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/dining/meghan-markle-kitchen-as-ever.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a></em>:</p>

<p>Asked about the controversy over her decision to turn her back on royal life and focus on entrepreneurship, Meghan replied, “I need to work, and I love to work.” </p>



<p>“This is a way I can connect my home life and my work.”</p>



<p>In response to those who have accused her of being &#8220;inauthentic&#8221; and &#8220;unrelatable,&#8221; Meghan points out that she got divorced in her thirties and often grappled with economic uncertainty in her young adulthood.</p>

<p>“Don’t they know my life hasn’t always been like this?” Meghan asked the <em>Times</em> reporter as she &#8220;gestured&#8221; around her $14 million Montecito home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-much-needed-win-for-meghan-markle">A much-needed win for Meghan Markle</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been following Meghan&#8217;s career in recent years, you know that it&#8217;s been through numerous ups and downs.</p>



<p>Her recent rough patch began with the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/meghan-markle-was-humiliated-by-spotify-firing-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelation of her Spotify podcast</a> after a single season, and it continued through a succession of disappointing projects.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain's Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary." class="wp-image-522389" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain&#8217;s Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by KOLA SULAIMON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s cooking show</a> has been renewed for a second season, and her line of treats has sold out within hours.</p>



<p>And in the very near future, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan will launch a new podcast</a>, this one about female entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>To be fair, Meghan probably still has a ways to go before her haters will be convinced that she has the makings of a successful businesswoman.</p>



<p>But after a year of decline, her career prospects appear to be on the upswing.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, Meghan Markle is currently working hard to make a name for herself as a lifestyle mogul.</p>



<p>And with a successful <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix cooking show</a> and her own line of luxury housewares, she&#8217;s off to a good start.</p>



<p>But the established icons of that world &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bethenny-frankel-blasts-meghan-markles-martha-stewart-perfect-persona/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Martha Stewart</a> &#8212; may not have been as welcoming as Meghan would have hoped. </p>



<p>And now, the Duchess of Sussex has gone on the attack against Stewart, making it clear that <em>no one</em> will stop her from claiming her place as queen of the kitchen. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-to-martha-don-t-test-me">Meghan to Martha: &#8216;Don&#8217;t test me&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;I had the entire British tabloid media come after me &#8212; and those people are full-blown evil. If Martha Stewart thinks I&#8217;m scared of her, she&#8217;s got another thing coming,&#8221; Meghan said this week in an interview with Sidd Finch of <em>Variety</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only so much disrespect I&#8217;m willing to tolerate, and if Martha keeps pushing me, she&#8217;s gonna find out where my line is,&#8221; the duchess added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the situation to get physical, but I&#8217;m not opposed to taking it there. I&#8217;m from LA, okay? What Kendrick did to Drake will look like an act of mercy by the time I&#8217;m done with Martha.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, these are not the kind of comments we&#8217;re accustomed to hearing from Meghan.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s worth noting that she and Prince Harry have been forced to deal with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-prince-harry-accused-of-bullying-non-profit-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one controversy after another</a> in 2025. And clearly, all that negative press is beginning to take a toll.</p>



<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re supposed to think Martha is this supreme badass because she hangs out with Snoop and she served some time? B-tch, please,&#8221; Meghan continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;If you ask me, they should&#8217;ve left that loser in jail. She was more useful making pinecone centerpieces for her fellow jailbirds than she&#8217;s ever been out here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not to be outdone, Martha took to social media to respond with some scathing remarks of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is the Duchess mad at me?&#8221; Martha wrote in a lengthy screed that appeared on her Facebook page at 3:17 this morning.</p>



<p>Stewart also added a photo of Queen Elizabeth II, writing, &#8220;Meghan, I might be 83, but this won&#8217;t be the first time that you got wrecked by an old lady.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reached for comment, fellow lifestyle maven Gwyneth Paltrow told <em>Variety</em>:</p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly, I hope they settle it in the ring. I&#8217;m sick of all the yapping from those two. And if either one of them tries to come at <em>me</em>, I&#8217;ll roll up with my whole Goop Troop behind me, know what I mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Gwyneth proceeded to make &#8220;elaborate&#8221; gunshot sound effects for several minutes.</p>



<p>We really don&#8217;t know what to say about this story, other than &#8212; April Fools! </p>

<p>Last week, we reported on the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-defends-unthinkable-decision-to-step-down-from-charity-honoring-princess-diana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry has stepped down from Sentebale</a>, a charitable organization that he co-founded in 2006.</p>



<p>It was clear at the time that Harry had clashed with Sentebale CEO Sophie Chandauka.</p>



<p>Some of the details of the conflict remain mysterious, but the picture is coming into clearer focus every day.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1024x713.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-522156" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1080x752.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1200x836.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andy Stenning  &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sophie-allegedly-clashed-with-meghan-markle-at-a-photo-op">Sophie allegedly clashed with Meghan Markle at a photo-op</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/31/royal-family/video-of-meghan-markle-with-charity-chair-resurfaces-after-prince-harry-bullying-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, the trouble began when Meghan started &#8220;barking orders for [Sophie] to stand elsewhere in a photo-op.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meghan made a surprise appearance at the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in Wellington, Florida last summer, and Chandauka was forced to shuffle around to let her into a group photo. </p>



<p>In reality, Meghan didn&#8217;t &#8220;bark orders.&#8221; She merely asked Sophie, “You want to come over here?” Still the awkward clip quickly went viral.</p>



<p>“We would have been really excited had we known ahead of time [Meghan was coming], but we didn’t,” Sophie said in a new interview with <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/prince-harry-accused-of-harassment-and-bullying-at-scale-by-sentebale-chair-sophie-chandauka-13338558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky News</a>.</p>



<p>“And so the choreography went badly on stage because we had too many people on stage,” she explained. </p>



<p>“The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the Duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me.”</p>

<p>Sophie says that Harry asked her to issue a statement “in support” of Meghan amid the controversy. She refused.</p>



<p>“Not because I didn’t care about the Duchess, but because I knew what would happen if I did so, number one,” she explained. “And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.”</p>



<p>Sophie claims that Harry then sent her an even harsher note, in which he asked her to “explain herself.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I knew what would happen if I did so, number one. And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes,” she said, going on to accuse Harry of “harassment and bullying.”</p>

<p>According to royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams, that incident was the beginning of the end for Sentebale.</p>



<p>In a new interview with the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14553837/awkward-video-meghan-harry-sentebale.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, Fitzwilliams claims that “the ferocious feud that has split Sentebale” will be “a bitter blow to [Harry].”</p>



<p>Harry announced his departure from Sentebale last week in a sternly worded statement.</p>



<p>“What’s transpired is unthinkable,” he wrote. “It is devastating that the relationship between the charity’s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, it sounds like there&#8217;s more drama to come from this situation.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is one of the most famous women on the planet. But she&#8217;s got an army of haters, and unlike some A-list celebs, her defenders are not quite as outspoken.</p>



<p>Thanks to her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix series</a> and housewares brand, the Duchess of Sussex is finally making a name for herself as a lifestyle guru, but her success has attracted a new level of criticism.</p>



<p>These days, high-profile media figures are dunking on Meghan, a trend that seems to stem from the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-netflix-show-is-awful-should-end-the-career-of-thirsty-star-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative response to her show</a>.</p>

<p>Now, in a move that would&#8217;ve been unimaginable just a few years ago, former Meghan and Harry ally Graydon Carter is roasting the duchess at every opportunity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graydon-carter-blasts-meghan-markle-with-literary-zinger">Graydon Carter blasts Meghan Markle with literary zinger</h2>



<p>In a new conversation with <em><a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/graydon-carter-on-guest-lists-dress-codes-and-meghan-markle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview</a></em> magazine, the former <em>Vanity Fair</em> editor labeled Meghan the “Undine Spragg of Montecito.”</p>



<p>The comment refers to the main character in Edith Wharton&#8217;s 1913 novel <em>The Custom of the Country</em>. And it&#8217;s not meant as a compliment.</p>



<p>Undine Spragg is a conniving, hyper-ambitious woman who marries and divorces several times in an effort to secure the wealth and position she covets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26950.The_Custom_of_the_Country?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads</a> describes her as &#8220;a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating&#8221;  and one who engages in &#8220;social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-custom-of-the-country/characters/undine-spragg#:~:text=Undine%20Spragg%20is%20the%20daughter,society%20in%20New%20York%20City." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LitCharts</a> “feels little satisfaction in achieving her goals and often finds herself haunted by her failures.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, that&#8217;s not the kind of character you want to be compared to. And that&#8217;s not the only time that Carter has taken a shot at Meghan in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Meghan appeared on the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em> in 2017. Carter claims he never heard her name until the day when one of his colleagues suggested her as a cover model.</p>



<p>“Jane Sarkin, who booked our covers, came in and said, ‘We should do a cover on Meghan Markle,’” he recently told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/24/royal-family/meghan-markle-thought-she-landed-vanity-fair-cover-for-charity-work-not-prince-harry-relationship-ex-editor-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“I said, ‘I have no idea what that is, why should we do a story on her?’” Carter asked.</p>



<p>“So she said, ‘Because she’s going to marry Prince Harry.’”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain's Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary." class="wp-image-522389" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain&#8217;s Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by KOLA SULAIMON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Carter says Meghan became irate when she learned that the magazine was more interested in her love life than her charity work.</p>



<p>“Excuse me, Is this going to all be about Prince Harry? Because I thought we were going to be talking about my charities and my philanthropy,&#8221; Meghan allegedly complained.</p>



<p>“This woman is slightly adrift on the facts and reality,” Carter noted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graydon-carter-says-princess-di-would-not-be-team-meghan">Graydon Carter says Princess Di would not be Team Meghan</h2>



<p>Carter was a longtime friend of Princess Diana&#8217;s, and he also shared his thoughts on what Di might think of Harry&#8217;s wife.</p>



<p>“I would think she would feel great sorrow for her son to have been pulled away from his family like this, especially his brother but also his father,” he said. “Anytime someone comes between siblings, that’s a disaster, horrible for a family.”</p>



<p>So, yeah. Meghan probably isn&#8217;t thrilled with Graydon Carter at the moment.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is forging ahead.</p>



<p>Critics be damned.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard, Markle is starring in a Netflix series that most <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-netflix-show-is-awful-should-end-the-career-of-thirsty-star-review/">viewers believe to be truly awful</a>.</p>



<p>The former actress, and wife of Prince Harry, seems intent on rebuilding her reputation/changing the narrative/making lots of money, however&#8230; because she isn&#8217;t done relaunching her entertainment career.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/">Markle is coming out with a podcast</a>.</p>



<p>The Duchess of Sussex and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-called-out-by-clothing-designer-over-as-ever-brand-name/">As Ever founder</a> has teamed up with Lemonada Media for her latest foray into podcasting &#8212; and People Magazine has released the first trailer for this project.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Meghan, and this is <em>Confessions of a Female Founder</em>, a show where I chat with female entrepreneurs and friends about the sleepless nights, the lessons learned and the laser focus that got them to where they are today,&#8221; Markle says in the preview, which was released on March 25.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re diving into the highs — and the lows – and the kind of advice that turns small ideas into billion-dollar businesses. And of course, we&#8217;re going to get some girl talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>The snippet was interspersed with audio from the show, <a href="https://people.com/meghan-markle-new-podcast-trailer-listen-confessions-of-a-female-founder-lemonada-exclusive-11701291">courtesy of People</a>, where various guests speak about their own successes and their own struggles.</p>



<p>&#8220;It just started climbing and climbing, and there was 5,000, 10,000 people on our website,&#8221; one individual shares, while another says on air: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m broke, and no one is calling me.&#8221; </p>



<p>Yet <em>another</em> looks back at the turning point of, &#8220;I knew in that moment that I&#8217;d rather stand for something than sell a whole ton of product and stand for nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain just who any of these guests actually are. Guess we&#8217;ll need to tune in to the podcast to find out.</p>

<p>Markle will go beyond business, too, it seems.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you saying you&#8217;re not single now? Have I missed something in the past couple weeks? What&#8217;s happening?&#8221; Meghan asks one guest, which makes them both laugh.</p>



<p>To wrap up the teaser, Markle says:</p>



<p>&#8220;And through it all, I&#8217;m building a business of my own, and getting all sorts of practical advice along the way that I&#8217;m very excited to share with you. So join me for Confessions of a Female Founder from Lemonada Media, which by the way, is also female-founded. Launching April 8, wherever you get your podcasts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do this, ladies.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle isn&#8217;t receiving rave reviews for her Netflix series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-slammed-as-manipulative-liar-following-st-patricks-day-instagram-post/">Markle isn&#8217;t very popular these days</a>, but she clearly thinks this podcast will show listeners a new and appealing side to her.</p>



<p>At the end of the trailer, the ex-Suits cast member says simply: &#8220;This is not Shark Tank, think of this as &#8216;dolphin tank.&#8217; These are very friendly waters, it&#8217;s all going to be good.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Confessions of a Female Founder</em> will be Markle&#8217;s second-ever pod, as she previously hosted <em>Archetypes</em> on Spotify in 2022.</p>



<p>The show didn&#8217;t last long, but it topped Spotify&#8217;s international charts upon its premiere and somehow went on to win the People’s Choice Award for pop podcast.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is making a name for herself as a lifestyle guru.</p>



<p>The Duchess of Sussex has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Netflix show</a>, and she&#8217;s currently in the process of rolling out her own luxury brand.</p>



<p>Of course, by entering the lifestyle space, Meghan is inviting comparisons to famous predecessors like Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>



<p>Gaining the approval of these queens of the kitchen would surely bolster the legitimacy of Meghan&#8217;s latest business venture &#8212; unfortunately, that approval has been hard to come by.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been widely rumored that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martha is not a fan of Meghan&#8217;s latest pivot</a> and would prefer to see the duchess stay in her lane.</p>



<p>And Gwyneth? Well, that situation is a little harder to read.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-paltrow-may-have-had-a-change-of-heart-about-meghan-markle">Gwyneth Paltrow may have had a change of heart about Meghan Markle</h2>



<p>At first, Gwyneth seemed supportive of Meghan&#8217;s new career.</p>



<p>“I don’t know Meghan and Harry. I mean, I’ve met Meghan, who seems really lovely, but I don’t know her at all. Maybe I’ll try to get through their security detail and bring them a pie,&#8221; Paltrow told<em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Vanity Fair</a></em> last week.</p>



<p>Asked about Meghan’s lifestyle show and brand, Gwyneth explained that when “there’s noise about certain women in the culture, I do have, always, a strong instinct to stand up for them….Everybody deserves an attempt at everything that they want to try.”</p>

<p>But on the heels of those remarks, Gwyneth posted an Instagram clip (above) in which she seems to be making light of Meghan&#8217;s new persona.</p>



<p>Fans noted that Gwyneth paired the footage with “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)” by Natalie Cole, a song that Meghan used in the promos for her show.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-kitchen-skills-get-roasted-in-the-comments">Meghan&#8217;s kitchen skills get roasted in the comments</h2>



<p>In the comments section of the post, fans were convinced that Gwyneth was throwing shade at Meghan, and many noted that she filmed the scene in her own home (Meghan famously shot her show at a rental property).</p>



<p>“Gwyneth Paltrow continues to throw shade &amp; I’m here for it! No makeup in her actual kitchen!” commented one user (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-netflix-show-is-awful-should-end-the-career-of-thirsty-star-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Markle filmed her show</a> in the kitchen of a nearby rental home).</p>

<p>“Gwyneth is so genuine what a breath of fresh air compared to Markle,” added another, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/23/celebrity-news/fans-think-gwyneth-paltrow-is-throwing-shade-at-meghan-markle-in-new-cooking-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“Love this. No fake house, fake kitchen, fake hair extensions, fake friends just your beautiful true self. Such a breath of fresh air to see,” said a third person.</p>



<p>“Lol isn’t it this the song they keep using in the Meghan Markle promo?” a fourth chimed in.</p>



<p>So yeah, whether Gwyneth intended to shade Meghan or not, fans are interpreting the clip as an actor of hostility.</p>

<p>In other Meghan news, the duchess shared a new photo of her kids this week. Once again, their faces are obscured, but we can see that they&#8217;re both sporting red hair.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t catch many glimpses of the Sussex children, as their parents are understandably protective of their privacy. But Harry recently confirmed that they both take after him in the hair department.</p>



<p>&#8220;Definitely my mum. The ginger gene is a strong one!&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/meghan-markle-princess-lilibet-prince-archie-star-new-photo-red-hair-11702165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry told Stephen Colbert</a> when asked which royals the kids most resemble.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Spencer gene is very, very strong,&#8221; Harry added, referring to his mom&#8217;s maiden name. &#8220;I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids that there&#8217;s no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife&#8217;s genes, but I was wrong! Go gingers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps by posting the new pic, Meghan was trying to send the message that she&#8217;s bigger things to worry about than petty social media drama.</p>



<p>Or maybe she&#8217;s just genuinely unaware of Gwyneth&#8217;s subtle shade!</p>

<p>Well, apparently the fact that so many of them have cut ties with the Duke of Sussex tells us just about everything we need to know.</p>



<p>Yes, according to royal journalist Tom Quinn, the rumors of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/meghan-markle-prince-harry-losing-friends-in-la-amid-latest-pr-crises-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry getting dumped by his pals</a> are 100 percent true.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-turned-harry-woke-former-friends-allege">Meghan turned Harry &#8216;woke,&#8217; former friends allege</h2>



<p>These days, Quinn is promoting a new book titled <em>Yes Ma’am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants</em>. And he may have ruffled some feathers while promoting the tome in a new interview with Fox News.</p>



<p>“Meghan was blamed for … making Harry ‘too woke,’” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-blamed-by-prince-harrys-pals-making-him-too-woke-royal-exit-author" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quinn told the outlet</a> this week. </p>



<p>“One of Harry’s best friends said, ‘I can’t understand what Harry sees in her. She’s a tree hugger. She’s so woke.’ For Harry’s traditional friends, being woke was not a good thing,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;But I think Harry was, in a way, entranced by the fact that Meghan was able to offer him an alternative world from the one he’d always known.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-harry-s-friends">The beginning of the end for Harry&#8217;s friends</h2>



<p>Quinn went on to reveal that there was a specific incident that led to widespread discouragement among Harry&#8217;s closest friends.</p>



<p>“There’s a famous occasion where Meghan went with Harry and some of his friends from school and from the army — she went on a pheasant shoot at Sandringham, the royal family’s country home,” Quinn explained.</p>



<p>“She hated it because all of Harry’s friends were making the sorts of jokes that suggested they disliked everything to do with ‘woke.’ They made rude comments about tree-huggers. They just don’t like that kind of thing because, to a large extent, it’s seen as left-wing. They just didn’t like it.”</p>



<p>But while Harry&#8217;s friends seem to have assumed that he shifted his political beliefs in order to appease Meghan, Quinn notes that he may have found <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her views and beliefs</a> genuinely compelling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-new-beliefs">Harry&#8217;s new beliefs</h2>



<p>“With Meghan, [Harry] shifted across,” Quinn said. “He became much more sympathetic as she is about wanting to do good in the world. </p>



<p>&#8220;The idea of Harry being worried about those things before Meghan — it would never have occurred to him. I think Meghan really took him away from that [old] world, and they didn’t like that.”</p>



<p>Quinn&#8217;s book is primarily about the palace staff who serve the royals, so it should come as no surprise that one of the hottest Harry takes came from an employee.</p>

<p>“That terrible modern word ‘woke’ has often been used, and although I don’t like it, I can see why it is applied to Harry — he did become far more concerned about social issues and the rights of minorities than he’d ever been before Meghan’s arrival,” a former palace aide told Quinn.</p>



<p>The source added that Harry went from “being pretty easygoing” to being “more disgruntled” after he met Meghan.</p>



<p>Well, if he&#8217;s disgruntled, he&#8217;s certainly hiding it well. In most pics with Meghan, Harry looks to be happier than ever.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is making headlines for her skills in the kitchen (or lack thereof).</p>



<p>And no, we&#8217;re not talking about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-uses-daughter-lilibet-to-promote-netflix-show-cant-do-anything-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s new Netflix cooking show</a>.</p>



<p>Despite mixed reviews and relatively low ratings (more on that later), the series has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renewed for a second season</a>.</p>



<p>The renewal was a much-needed win for Meghan following a rough 2024. But the reaction to the duchess&#8217; latest Instagram post probably dampened her celebratory mood.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1024x572.png" alt="Meghan Markle in a scene from her upcoming Netflix cooking show." class="wp-image-515840" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1024x572.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-2048x1145.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-960x537.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1080x604.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle in a scene from her upcoming Netflix cooking show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-gets-blasted-as-walking-scam-in-response-to-latest-post">Meghan gets blasted as &#8216;walking scam&#8217; in response to latest post</h2>



<p>Things started out innocently enough.</p>



<p>Meghan posted an Instagram Story in which she whipped up some green waffles for her kids in honor of St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>But viewers quickly noticed that the ridges on the waffle maker in Meghan&#8217;s video did not match up with those on the finished product.</p>



<p>So Meg&#8217;s latest bit of content might not have been completely authentic. That might not be such a big deal, were it not for the fact that authenticity and reliability are huge parts of Meghan&#8217;s public persona these days.</p>

<p>As she continues to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roll out her new lifestyle brand</a>, Meghan is trying harder than ever to present herself as the kind of mom who can offer helpful tips and tricks to other moms.</p>



<p>But her waffle video did not move her closer to that goal. In fact, it had the opposite effect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-haters-have-a-field-day">Meghan&#8217;s haters have a field day</h2>



<p>“Meghan Markle’s relentless compulsion to lie about everything is baffling—even over something as trivial as a waffle. She posted a video of herself using a waffle maker with a divider, yet the so-called ‘homemade’ waffle she presented looked exactly like a store-bought one, missing the dividers that should have been there,” one viewe wrote on X, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/18/royal-family/fans-accuse-meghan-markle-of-faking-activity-with-kids-for-social-media-shes-a-walking-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t be surprising at all! The effort she puts into staging even the simplest things is almost impressive. Imagine going through all that just to fake a waffle — it’s like she can’t help herself,” a second person agreed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187696856-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex arrives for The Paley Center for Media gala honoring actor and director Tyler Perry, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills on December 4, 2024.

<p>“She didn’t fresh make them for her kids. She used these frozen waffles,” a third chimed in, along with a photo from the Kellogg’s that they say Meghan stole for her Story. “Why the big deal? Because her post is showing she made it all from scratch. She is a total manipulative liar. About everything.”</p>



<p>“I immediately saw the difference when I saw the video. I couldn’t grasp the reason to lie about waffles. What kind of person needs to do that? Meghan Markle is a walking scam,” a fourth added.</p>



<p>Obviously, the commentary is unnecessarily harsh, but sadly, that&#8217;s par for the course with Meghan.</p>



<p>The truth is, she probably did cut come corners while putting her latest video together. But clearly, the harshest criticism is coming from people who already hated her for some absolutely unhinged reason.</p>
