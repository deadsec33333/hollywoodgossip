<p>Though <em>Snow White</em> enjoyed a strong opening weekend, it fell short of some more optimistic projections.</p>



<p>Some are blaming audience fatigue with Disney&#8217;s live action remakes. Others are blaming <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/snow-white-controversy-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Snow White</em>&#8216;s controversies</a>.</p>



<p>And some are straight-up blaming Rachel Zegler, the star who plays the titular Disney princess.</p>



<p>One of those people is the adult son of the film&#8217;s producer. In a since-deleted rant, he seemingly accused Zegler of &#8220;narcissism&#8221; and of sabotaging her own film&#8217;s box office numbers.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler for Snow White on March 15 of 2025." class="wp-image-522248" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the World Premiere of Disney&#8217;s Snow White at El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on March 15, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-snow-white-made-nearly-90-million-on-its-opening-weekend">&#8216;Snow White&#8217; made nearly $90 million on its opening weekend</h2>



<p>Last weekend, Disney&#8217;s live-action<em> Snow White</em> remake opened a little below expectations. It made $43 million domestically and $87.3 million globally.</p>



<p>While that&#8217;s <em>far </em>from a flop, people are already looking to assign blame. </p>



<p>In part because there is a cottage industry rooting for every new thing &#8212; television, film, and video games specifically to fail, and then to provide a poisonous &#8220;explanation.&#8221;</p>



<p>In this case, <em>Snow White</em> was controversial for both valid and invalid reasons long before it premiered. And there are certain figures who seem eager to blame the star, Rachel Zegler.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler stuns on March 20, 2025." class="wp-image-522250" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the special screening of Disney&#8217;s Snow White at The Whitby Hotel on March 20, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, Rachel Zegler&#8217;s acting in the film has received very positive reviews. Some people have taken umbrage because Zegler is of Colombian and Polish descent. You can likely guess which side of her family tree has elicited ire from <em>the usual crowd</em>.</p>



<p>Zegler is also outspoken with positive messaging. In 2024, she wrote a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/rachel-zegler-trump-apology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scathing takedown of Donald Trump</a>. She has also been adamant about the liberation of Palestinians amidst the genocidal bombing campaign by the IDF.</p>



<p>The latter has come up again. <em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/snow-white-death-threats-zegler-social-media-guru-1236347433/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> </em>recently reported that producer Marc Platt flew to meet with Zegler in August of 2024 to ask her to remove a &#8220;free Palestine&#8221; comment that she had made on social media. The context was that she was thanking fans for watching the <em>Snow White</em> trailer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jonah-platt-is-not-a-rachel-zegler-fan-it-seems">Jonah Platt is not a Rachel Zegler fan, it seems</h2>



<p>Obviously, the story elicited numerous comments &#8212; including hefty criticisms of Disney (who seemingly prompted the social media intervention) and of producer Marc Platt himself.</p>



<p>When a commenter called Platt &#8220;creepy as hell&#8221; for policing Zegler&#8217;s social media commentary, Platt&#8217;s son saw it.</p>



<p>Jonah Platt launched into a rant &#8212; one that he, in what one might call irony, has since deleted.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on March 2, 2025." class="wp-image-522254" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“You really want to do this? Yeah, my dad, the producer of enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to fly across the country,&#8221; Jonah Platt began his now-deleted comment, according to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/snow-white-marc-platt-jonah-slams-rachel-zegler-1236173434/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>.</p>



<p>He complained that his father &#8220;<em>had</em>&#8221; to fly out &#8220;to reprimand his 20 year old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie.&#8221;</p>



<p>A film, he noted, &#8220;for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicity for.”</p>

<p>“This is called adult responsibility and accountability,&#8221; Jonah Platt, who despite the tone of his message is only 38, continued. &#8220;And her actions clearly hurt the film’s box office.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continued: &#8220;Free speech does not mean you’re allowed to say whatever you want in your private employment without repercussions.&#8221; That much, at least, is generally true.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation,&#8221; Jonah Platt claimed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on March 15, 2025 with a dazzling smile." class="wp-image-522256" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Rachel Zegler attends the world premiere of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Snow White&#8221; at the El Capitan theatre in Los Angeles, March 15, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jonah Platt went on to allege that she &#8220;hijacked&#8221; promotion of <em>Snow White</em> &#8220;for her own immature desires.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added that she did so &#8220;at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a bizarre twist, Jonah Platt concluded with: &#8220;Narcissism is not something to be coddled or encouraged.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-casting-is-probably-not-where-this-film-went-awry">Casting is probably not where this film went awry</h2>



<p>Fellas, is it <em>narcissism </em>to, in a social media thread thanking your own fans for watching a movie trailer, advocate against ongoing atrocities?</p>



<p>Just for the record, both Jonah Platt and Marc Platt have used their own platforms to speak out publicly on issues near and dear to their own hearts.</p>



<p>Unlike his rant about Zegler, Jonah Platt was absolutely right when he has repeatedly condemned <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-takes-out-super-bowl-ad-for-yeezy-website-that-only-sells-swastika-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a>. And Snow White isn&#8217;t even the first film in the past year that Marc Platt has produced where one or more stars have spoken out on behalf of the Palestinian people.

<p>Did Rachel Zegler commenting influence the <em>Snow White</em> box office? Sure. Everything does. Gal Gadot&#8217;s too. Peter Dinklage&#8217;s commentary surely did, too, and he&#8217;s not even <em>in </em>the film.</p>



<p>But then, Zegler cannot conceivably be responsible for the film&#8217;s budget ballooning to $270 million. Reportedly <em>Snow White</em> also went through nearly half a dozen script doctors. By most accounts, her performance <em>carries </em>the film.</p>



<p>Pretending that a lead actor saying something decent on social media can tank a film seems like a great way to discourage other actors from saying decent things on social media. </p>



<p>But that does not make it a reality.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin is very much in the <em>Rust </em>trailer, in case you were wondering how they&#8217;d handle that.</p>



<p>More than three years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/alec-baldwin-im-not-responsible-for-halyna-hutchins-death-if-i-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tragedy</a> struck the set of the Western film. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins lost her life.</p>



<p>Now, the trailer is out.</p>



<p>Watch the <em>Rust </em>teaser for yourself. A sense of unease permeates every moment &#8212; at least, if you know what happened.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1024x576.png" alt="Alec Baldwins on 'The Baldwins' during the series premiere." class="wp-image-520049" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the premiere episode of &#8216;The Baldwins,&#8217; Alec Baldwin had clearly seen happier times.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rust-trailer-is-out">The &#8216;Rust&#8217; trailer is out</h2>



<p>As you can see below, the <em>Rust </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6q3scsTwg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> is full of Western vistas, horses, tension, death, and old-timey shootouts.</p>



<p>Yes, some of it feels uncomfortably close to the tragedy that befell that film set.</p>



<p>And yes, Alec Baldwin takes center stage in multiple scenes in the trailer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The film follows 13-year-old orphan, Lucas Hollister, who accidentally kills a Kansas rancher. He then has to go on the run with his grandfather, an aging outlaw who reemerges to protect the boy.</p>



<p>Patrick Scott McDermott plays Lucas. And Alec Baldwin plays his grandfather, Harland Rust.</p>



<p>The cast includes Travis Fimmel of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> and <em>Warcraft (2016)</em>, Frances Fisher, Josh Hopkins, and more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-filming-this-cost-halyna-hutchins-her-life">Filming this cost Halyna Hutchins her life</h2>



<p>Notably, the Rust credits honor the late Halyna Hutchins as cinematographer. </p>



<p>After her death, Bianca Cline stepped into the cinematographer role. Those were big shoes to fill.</p>



<p>Additionally, Halyna Hutchins&#8217; husband &#8212; now widower &#8212; Matthew Hutchins appears as Executive Producer. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="658" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1024x658.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin on July 12, 2024." class="wp-image-522184" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-300x193.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-768x494.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-2048x1316.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-960x617.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1080x694.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1200x771.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alec Baldwin gets emotional at the conclusion of his trial for involuntary manslaughter in First Judicial District Court on July 12, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ramsay de Give-Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Throughout the trailer, there is a palpable discomfort &#8212; and it has nothing to do with the trailer itself, which promises tension, violence, and warm moments.</p>



<p>But the rest of us are aware of the tragedy of Hutchins&#8217; death.</p>



<p>The world at large also knows of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/alec-baldwin-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious prosecutor</a> who seemed determined to put Alec Baldwin in prison over the senseless accident &#8212; so determined, it seems, that she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-shooting-trial-dismissed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sabotaged her own case</a>. (Judges as a rule do not enjoy when you allegedly commit Brady violations)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-a-film-s-quality-overcome-its-baggage">Can a film&#8217;s quality overcome its baggage?</h2>



<p><em>Rust </em>will hit theaters on May 2. There were, for obvious reasons, multiple delays.</p>



<p>The film has already premiered at the Camerimage Film Festival in Poland. The reviews seem to be fairly positive.</p>



<p>But the dismissal of Baldwin&#8217;s manslaughter charges did not undo <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/alec-baldwin-ptsd-rust-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his trauma</a>. Similarly, the specter of what took place on set hangs over the trailer for <em>Rust</em>. It&#8217;s unclear what sort of public reception the film will receive.</p>

<p><em>Snow White</em> is releasing amidst controversy.</p>



<p>All of Disney&#8217;s live-action adaptations ruffle some feathers. Usually, it&#8217;s a discussion about art or copyright.</p>



<p>Starring <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/rachel-zegler-trump-apology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Zegler</a> as the titular fairy tale princess and Gal Gadot as the Queen, this adaptation will once again retell a Brothers Grimm classic.</p>



<p>Adaptations can often be polarizing. But the controversy surrounding this <em>Snow White</em> has little to do with the story.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on February 10, 2025." class="wp-image-521169" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the 2025 New York Theatre Workshop Gala at Gotham Hall on February 10, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rachel-zegler-plays-the-lead-in-snow-white">Rachel Zegler plays the lead in &#8216;Snow White&#8217;</h2>



<p>Sometimes, discussing a controversy means delving into the heart of a complex issue, or questioning whether we can separate a piece of media from a horrible person who is a part of it. Both of those do come up when discussing this film.</p>



<p>But in this case, the first &#8220;controversy&#8221; about <em>Snow White</em> is neither. There is a certain group of people who are furious that a latine actor like Rachel Zegler would play Snow White.</p>



<p>To be clear, Zelger has extremely fair skin and very dark hair. She matches the description of Snow White, despite not being white within the social construct of &#8220;race.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a 2022 interview, Zegler pointed out that the classic animated <em>Snow White</em> is an enduring favorite in many Spanish-speaking countries.</p>



<p>&#8220;I get to be a Latina princess,&#8221; she excitedly told <em><a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/rachel-zegler-snow-white-casting-backlash-1235165496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a></em> at the time. </p>



<p>This excitement, which will connect her and the story to many viewers, is exactly what makes this <em>Snow White</em> a controversy among certain people. If you see other people&#8217;s mere existence as a threat to yourself, then you will react negatively to their excitement and joy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-snow-white-ableist-towards-little-people">Is &#8216;Snow White&#8217; ableist towards little people?</h2>



<p>This is where we get into a <em>Snow White</em> controversy that is actually worthy of discussion rather than derision. Because Snow White famously finds refuge with seven dwarves.</p>



<p>In some versions of the story, this means seven creatures from folklore. But in others, it means seven little people &#8212; people with dwarfism.</p>



<p>“You’re still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&#8221; remarked <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/peter-dinklage-disney-responds-snow-white-criticism-1235080612/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Dinklage</a> in 2022. &#8220;Take a step back and look at what you’re doing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Emmy-winning actor continued: &#8220;It makes no sense to me. You’re progressive in one way, but then you’re still making that f&#8211;king backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together?”</p>



<p>At the time, Disney responded by consulting with the dwarfism community. In 2023, it was revealed that of the seven dwarves in this <em>Snow White</em> adaptation, one is a little person, while the other six are not. Is that the right call? Or is it taking away acting jobs from little people?</p>



<p>As we said, a complex topic. The blurring of little people with mountain-dwelling fantasy people makes this casting complex. Some little people would rather see seven disabled actors fill the role. Others would prefer to not have their disability treated as a separate species, even in film. </p>



<p>(Just a reminder, <em>many </em>fantasy stories cast little people actors without portraying them as non-humans, from Nyomi Sedai on <em>Wheel of Time</em> to Dinklage&#8217;s <em>Game of Thrones</em> character)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-this-snow-white-adaptation-be-feminist">Will this &#8216;Snow White&#8217; adaptation be feminist?</h2>



<p>In 2023, Rache Zegler suggested during a red carpet interview that Snow White will be more feminist than the 1937 film. </p>



<p>“It’s no longer 1937 . . . She’s not going to be saved by the prince, and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be,” she excitedly told Variety.</p>



<p>In a sane world, that would be good news. Most people enjoy it when main characters have their own agency, making choices during a story rather than simply reacting with panicked hysterics. Unfortunately, we live in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a world gone mad</a>.</p>

<p>The usual clowns reacted with fury and indignation, taking aim at Rachel Zegler and raising the specter of controversy about the new <em>Snow White</em>.</p>



<p>Zegler herself expressed sadness that people tried to twist her words into criticism of the original film, which she loves.</p>



<p>She emphasized that Snow White can have love and independence, noting that the &#8220;love story is very integral.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rachel-zegler-and-gal-gadot-clash-on-the-genocide-in-gaza">Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot clash on the genocide in Gaza</h2>



<p>In late 2023, the government of Israel launched a massive bombing campaign and invasion of Gaza, ostensibly to liberate Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack.</p>



<p>Some very deliberate conflation of Palestinians with Hamas combined with literal generations of propaganda meant that many Americans lack a contextual understanding of the plight that Palestinians already faced.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> reports that the Israeli military slaughtered nearly 50,000 Palestinians. </p>



<p>More than half of the victims were women, children, or the elderly. And yes, this all ties in to the Snow White controversy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot on March 2, 2025 at the Oscars." class="wp-image-521174" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot speak onstage during the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Rachel Zegler has publicly affirmed her support for the people of Palestine. Yet the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel has called for a boycott of <em>Snow White</em>.</p>



<p>The reason for that is Gal Gadot, who portrays the Queen. Gadot served in the IDF for two years, and has been openly and publicly pro-Israel. She even <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/gal-gadot-bearing-witness-screening-los-angeles-hamas-massacre-october-7-israel-1234873701/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screened Israeli propaganda footage</a> in an attempt to rally support for Israel&#8217;s ongoing atrocities.</p>



<p>In other words, people on both sides of one of the most polarizing atrocities in decades believe that one of the lead actresses is on the right side and that the other is not. Which means that people on both sides will be avoiding it, for either good or bad reasons.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-box-office-decide">Will the box office decide?</h2>



<p>Disney is a behemoth, in part because the massive and controversial corporation routinely prioritizes profits over art and over people. The latest example is the company&#8217;s rollback of DEI policies, seemingly out of a craven desire to avoid being targeted by the Trump administration.</p>



<p>Even Disney has flops, however. And upsetting various and disparate (even mutually exclusive) groups of potential viewers can help make that happen.</p>



<p>At the same time &#8230; not everyone is aware of literally any of this. There are millions of blissfully offline people who will see &#8220;that pretty girl and the lady from <em>Wonder Woman</em>&#8221; and not know a single thing about either of them. What is <em>that </em>like?</p>

<p>Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli are longtime Bond producers. There is a new joint venture, in which three parties are co-owners of the franchise &#8212; while Amazon MGM has creative control.</p>



<p>And, if Bezos&#8217; followers have any say in it, that creative control would start with casting a talented and absurdly good-looking actor, Henry Cavill, to portray James Bond.</p>

<p>In addition to the actor&#8217;s name, the replies filled with photos and GIFs of Henry Cavill.</p>



<p>Obviously, he is a skilled actor with a long history of nuanced portrayals of different types of characters.</p>



<p>But, in a sense, Cavill&#8217;s photos and GIFs speak for themselves. He is notoriously good-looking &#8212; and is clearly not one of those actors who gets hot for like three years and then is merely &#8220;distinguished&#8221; thereafter. He&#8217;s still turning heads and attracting people to screens well over a decade after most first heard of him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-you-know-that-henry-cavill-auditioned-to-play-james-bond-many-years-ago">Did you know that Henry Cavill auditioned to play James Bond many years ago?</h2>



<p>In 2006, the James Bond franchise did a bit of a reboot with <em>Casino Royale</em>. It starred Daniel Craig, who is himself a beloved and extraordinarily talented actor.</p>



<p>Last year, that film&#8217;s director Martin Campbell spoke to <em><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/1782718/Henry-Cavill-James-Bond-audition-Casino-Royale-director-Martin-Campbell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Express UK</a></em> and recalled Henry Cavill&#8217;s audition: “He looked great in the audition. His acting was tremendous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Campbell continued; “And look, if Daniel didn’t exist, Henry would have made an excellent Bond. He looked terrific, he was in great physical shape…very handsome, very chiseled. He just looked a little young at that time back then.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Henry Cavill on January 18 of 2024." class="wp-image-519789" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0221_henrycavill_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hypnotically photogenic Henry Cavill attends a press conference for &#8220;Argylle&#8221; on January 18, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Martin Campbell also weighed in on the idea of Henry Cavill being the next James Bond now that Daniel Craig is done with the role.</p>



<p>“Henry’s 40, so by the time he’s done the third one he’s going to be 50,&#8221; he reasoned. Henry Cavill was born in 1983.</p>



<p>&#8220;And anything beyond that’s two, three years per Bond,&#8221; Campbell reasoned. The director then affirmed: &#8220;He’s in good shape Henry, he’s a good guy. He did very well in the audition, but ironically he was too young.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-he-is-too-old-to-play-bond-but-was-previously-too-young-for-the-role">So he is &#8216;too old&#8217; to play Bond, but was previously &#8216;too young&#8217; for the role?</h2>



<p>It sounds like Henry Cavill may have fallen into an age trap that has limited countless other actors in the entertainment industry. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that most of those actors have been women &#8212; playing young love interests and then those roles often dry up until they&#8217;re old enough to play &#8220;hot moms&#8221; until they metamorphize into playing <em>my </em>favorite role: badass, unfriendly grandmas (sometimes at the ripe-old age of 46).</p>



<p>Cavill is notoriously good looking. Even comments sections filled almost entirely with heterosexual men tend to remark upon it. But it&#8217;s possible that he&#8217;ll never play James Bond.</p>



<p>On the plus side, he&#8217;ll likely keep playing deeply nerdy roles that he prefers. Isn&#8217;t he working on <em>Warhammer </em>right now? His dance card&#8217;s probably pretty full.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominees for the 97th Academy Awards</a> were announced today.</p>



<p>And as usual, the list contained some major surprises.</p>



<p>Some big names were snubbed, while other major talents received their very first nominations. </p>



<p>But the biggest shocker of all might have been the absolute dominance of <em>Emilia Perez.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emilia-perez-is-set-to-win-big-at-the-oscars">Emilia Perez Is Set to Win Big at the Oscars</h2>



<p>The French-produced Netflix film scored a whopping 13 nominations, making it tied for the second-most nods of all time.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s a several-way tie that includes such cinematic heavy-hitters as <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, <em>Forrest Gump</em>, and <em>Oppenheimer</em>.)</p>



<p>The film also received more noms than any other 2024 film by a considerable margin. <em>The Brutalist </em>and <em>Wicked</em> tied for second most with 10 nominations each.</p>

<p>So good news, right? The most nominated film of the year is an energetic musical that features such beloved stars as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/selena-gomez/page/2/">Selena Gomez</a> and Zoe Saldaña. </p>



<p>And it&#8217;s available on a streaming service you probably already subscribe to! What could be better?</p>



<p>Well, we hate to rain on your cinephile parade, but <em>Emilia Perez</em> has become a lightning rod for controversy in recent months, and not for the reasons you might expect.</p>



<p>The film tells the story of Manitas Del Monte, the fictional head of a Mexican drug cartel who undergoes gender-affirming surgery to become the title character.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="666" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1024x666.png" alt="Selena Gomez stars in the Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez." class="wp-image-517616" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1024x666.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-300x195.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-768x500.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-2048x1333.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-960x625.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1080x703.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-1.24.00-PM-1200x781.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez stars in the Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (age 114/Why Not Productions/Pathé Films/France 2 Cinéma)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s not the sort of premise one hears every day, and <em>Emilia Perez</em> deserves at least some credit for showcasing the kind of stories that are seldom seen in mainstream cinema.</p>



<p>But the film&#8217;s critics argue that it&#8217;s not doing so responsibly. At all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-criticisms-of-emilia-perez">The (Many) Criticisms of Emilia Perez</h2>



<p>For starters, French director Jacques Audiard has been widely criticized for hiring a mostly non-Mexican cast and crew, including several actors (including Selena) who are not fluent in Spanish. </p>



<p>Audiard does <em>not</em> speak Spanish himself, and when addressing concerns that he chose not to film in Mexico &#8212; or even to study Mexican culture before embarking on this project &#8212; he&#8217;s come off as glib and dismissive.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did Shakespeare need to go all the way to Verona to write a story about that place?&#8221; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250121-why-some-mexicans-are-criticising-oscar-tipped-emilia-perez">Audiard once asked his critics</a>.)</p>



<p>Given its storyline &#8212; which centers a number of hot-button social issues &#8212; you might assume that the film has been targeted by conservative groups who take issue with the its trans protagonist and drug-money-fueled storylines.</p>

<p>But in an ironic twist worthy of an Oscar-winning screenplay, the loudest complaints about <em>Emilia Perez</em> have mostly come from the progressive end of the political spectrum.</p>



<p>(In fairness, that might be a result of the fact that conservatives were less likely to be familiar with the ultra-niche film, a situation that may change as a result of today&#8217;s nominations.)</p>



<p>Those who might normally be inclined to praise the movie for its prominent representation of a trans character have instead been pointing out that 1. Said portrayal is not terribly nuanced or sensitive, and 2.  <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> &#8212; a film that offered a much more compassionate and insightful take on the trans experience &#8212; was snubbed by the Academy entirely.</p>



<p><a href="https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/">GLAAD</a> slammed the film as “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman”.</p>



<p>&#8220;Emilia Perez is a regressive movie that thinks it’s woke. It will probably win an Oscar,&#8221; <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/390998/emilia-perez-selena-gomez-oscars-green-book-crash-transgender-musical">Vox</a></em> lamented before comparing the film to <em>Crash</em>, another derided (and now largely forgotten) Oscar darling that scored big by playing on left-leaning sympathies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but EMILIA PEREZ getting 13 Oscar nominations is instantly one of the funniest things that has ever happened at the Oscars,&#8221; critic Sonny Bunch <a href="https://x.com/SonnyBunch/status/1882428799150931978">wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>&#8220;I can’t even wrap my head around ‘Emilia Pérez’ getting THIRTEEN (13!!!) #Oscars nominations. Quite possibly the worst movie ever (mid-scores from audiences &amp; critics) to get double digit nominations. Baffling,&#8221; echoed <a href="https://x.com/JeffDLowe/status/1882434456356835437">podcast host</a> Jeff D. Lowe.</p>



<p>Lowe added a clip of one of the film&#8217;s much-mocked musical sequences.</p>



<p>It serves as a reminder that in addition to the criticism it&#8217;s received from the Left, Emilia Perez is not a film that&#8217;s likely to appeal to the more centrist denizens of Middle America, either.</p>



<p>In other words, a big night Audiard and his cast might lead to some very low ratings for this year&#8217;s Oscars telecast.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the moment all music theater majors have been waiting for:</p>



<p>The big screen adaptation of Wicked is now playing across the country.</p>



<p>Starring Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elpahaba, Wicked tells the story of the Witch of the West &#8212; before she became, well, wicked.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a prequel to the Wizard of Oz.</p>

<p><strong>How do I love the film of the hit stage musical, let me count the ways, starting with the way Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande set the screen ablaze as frenemy witches and sets, costumes and songs to die for. Seeing this joyous eruption once is not enough.</strong> &#8212; Peter Travers, ABC News</p>



<p><strong>This is a sumptuous and unsubtle treat grounded in Erivo’s graceful and subtle performance. When she defies gravity, she lifts us with her, and we lean forward to the next chapter.</strong> &#8212; Movie Mom</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Wicked&#8221; is the most entertaining film of the year and the most dazzling live-action Hollywood musical since “Chicago.” To put it in the kind of lingo used in Oz, I pronuncify it magnifical.</strong> &#8212; Wall Street Journal</p>



<p><strong><em>Cynthia Erivo&#8217;s impassioned performance is the most real thing in the artificial Oz of Jon M. Chu&#8217;s CGI-heavy &#8216;Wicked.&#8217;</em></strong> &#8212; Metro Weekly (Washington DC)</p>

<p><strong>There’s no denying that some people will be very, very happy with this. Others might find themselves wondering how something can be magical and meh at the same time.</strong> &#8212; The List</p>



<p><strong>Erivo and Grande deliver amazing performances in their respective roles as Elphaba and Galinda, capturing their characters&#8217; many facets and singing their hearts out. In terms of musical adaptations, Wicked exceeds all expectations</strong>. &#8212; 411 Mania</p>



<p><strong>Erivo brings a strong sense of dignity to Elphaba, while Grande proves she&#8217;s got comedic chops to go with those golden pipes. Jon M. Chu reaches new heights with this dazzling, vivid, and surprisingly heartfelt movie musical</strong>. &#8212; FlixChatter Film Blog</p>



<p><strong>Though the run time may seem excessive (two hours and 40 minutes?!), it is a testament to Chu and his team’s care that each musical number is carefully built up and celebrated with elaborate set pieces.</strong> &#8212; Little White Lies</p>

<p><strong>I did not care much for Wicked: Part One—I’m desperately tired of movies being one half of one movie, particularly when said movie has a run time of 160 minutes—but Ariana Grande delivers one of the best performances of the year as Glinda</strong>. &#8212; The Bulwark</p>



<p><strong>Radiant with combustible chemistry, Grande and Erivo play off each other with the testy flair of Olympic-class fencers</strong>. &#8212; Chicago Daily Herald</p>



<p><strong>Wicked isn’t really the vehicle to ponder deeper existential questions about the true nature of evil… It does, however, hit more than a few sweet spots for fellow misfits who see themselves in either Glinda or Elphaba.</strong> &#8212; Globe and Mail</p>



<p><strong>[Director John] Chu takes a stab at making a blockbuster for our times, one that doesn’t shy away from contending with the darkness of contemporary politics and society. Though Chu doesn’t always hit the mark, Wicked consistently dazzles.</strong> &#8212; Salon.com</p>

<p>Are Elphaba and Glinda gay?</p>



<p>Since <em>Wicked </em>first debuted on Broadway (and, arguably, many decades before that), fans have been shipping the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch of the North.</p>



<p>Their tense opposites-attract dynamic is all there. The song &#8220;What Is This Feeling?&#8221; begins almost as if describing a mutual schoolgirl crush.</p>



<p>Ariana Grande <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/cynthia-erivo-wicked-poster-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Cynthia Erivo</a> are weighing in on their characters&#8217; sexualities. And so is the OG <em>Wicked</em> Glinda, Kristin Chenoweth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-have-theorized-that-glinda-is-gay-for-many-years">Fans have theorized that Glinda is gay for many years</h2>



<p><em>Wicked </em>is out in theaters. Even among Broadway musicals, <em>Wicked </em>has a particularly strong following within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>



<p>So it is only natural that Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba in the theatrical adaptation, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/ariana-grande-wicked-boyfriend-ethan-slater-breaks-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Ariana Grande</a>, who plays Glinda, would chat with <em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gaytimes/video/7439810119589776673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gay Times</a></em> on the topic.</p>



<p>As you can se in the video below, neither shied away from suggestions that their characters&#8217; friendships &#8212; and animosity &#8212; had an undercurrent of romantic love.</p>

<p>“I think Elphie, she goes wherever the wind blows,” Cynthia described of her verdant character. </p>



<p>She added: “I think she loves Glinda. I think she loves love.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cynthia then emphasized: &#8220;And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with celebrating the deep connection that both of them have.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-is-true-love">&#8216;It is true love&#8217;</h2>

<p>“And trust and truth,&#8221; Ariana Grande chimed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just such a safe space for one another, which is what all relationships should be,&#8221; she expressed. &#8220;Whether it’s romantic or platonic.&#8221;</p>



<p>Delving into her character&#8217;s sexuality, Ariana commented: &#8220;Glinda might be a little in the closet. You never know! Give it a little more time.”</p>

<p>Kristin Chenoweth, who portrayed Glinda in its original Broadway run, replied to <em>E! News</em>&#8216; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCqC2tNRfl_/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post that shared part of the aforementioned discussion.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought so too way back when &#8230;&#8221; the Broadway legend commented.</p>



<p>Truth be told, Elphaba and Glinda have a story that makes more sense if you see the gay undertones of mutual yearning &#8212; and frustration. </p>

<p>Obviously, not everyone will agree that Glinda is gay.</p>



<p>First of all, some folks do not want to see clear relationships. There are people who watch <em>X-Men </em>movies and don&#8217;t see them as Professor X and Magneto making their divorce everyone&#8217;s problem. There are people who think that Xena and Gabrielle were just very good friends.</p>



<p>Also, to be fair, there are many excellent adaptations of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. The Glinda in NBC&#8217;s short-lived but excellent<em> Emerald City</em> is not the same as the <em>Wicked </em>version who is not the same as the Glinda who debuted in Technicolor nearly a century ago.</p>



<p>Just another prime example of love is love. </p>

<p>Denzel Washington will film his last movie one day. And he&#8217;s discussing some possibilities.</p>



<p>Though Denzel Washington can get a little ornery about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/denzel-washington-slams-meme-lovers-needs-to-lighten-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>, he is a legendary actor who has earned tremendous respect over his storied career.</p>



<p>He will also turn 70 years old in December. Some actors remain on screen until their 80s and beyond. Others choose retirement.</p>



<p><em>Gladiator II</em> won&#8217;t be Denzel Washington&#8217;s last movie. But what will?</p>

<p>Back in August, Denzel Washington acknowledged that, at this stage in his monumental career, there aren&#8217;t many films left for him to do.</p>



<p>However, the Oscar winner has some candidates in mind for his last movie.</p>

<p>“I played Othello at 22. I am about to play Othello at 70,” Denzel Washington commented. That production will co-star Jake Gyllenhaal.</p>



<p>“After that, I am playing Hannibal,&#8221; he noted. Washington refers there to the historical Carthaginian general, not to the iconic fictional antihero, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.</p>



<p>&#8220;After that, I’ve been talking to Steve McQueen about a film. After that, Ryan Coogler is writing a part for me in the next ‘Black Panther,'&#8221; he listed. Denzel Washington continued: &#8220;After that, I’m going to do the film ‘Othello,’ After that, I’m going to do King Lear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ultimately, Denzel Washington vowed: &#8220;After that, I’m going to retire.”</p>



<p>Incidentally, this is not the Oscar winner&#8217;s first connection to the <em>Black Panther</em> films. Prior to his tragic passing in 2020, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-mourned-remember-by-stunned-friends-and-co-star/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the late Chadwick Boseman</a> revealed that Denzel Washington had paid for his acting classes one summer.</p>



<p>That lineup of films sounds like a fine send-off to a storied acting career. That said, perhaps the order will surprise even Denzel Washington. And maybe something else will crop up and turn out to be his <em>actual </em>last movie.</p>

<p>Cole Hauser could make a<em> Fast &amp; Furious</em> return, reprising his earlier role. Should he?</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/is-taylor-sheridan-a-republican-yellowstone-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone</a></em>, which returns November 10,<em> </em>has been a hit. The show has spawned spinoffs and fan theories and whole new fandoms for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/yellowstone-josh-lucas-engaged-brianna-ruffalo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its stars</a>.</p>



<p>One of those stars is Cole Hauser. But many also know him from the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> franchise.</p>



<p>After his success as Rip Wheeler, is it time for Cole Hauser to make a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> return?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cole-hauser-plays-rip-wheeler-on-yellowstone">Cole Hauser plays Rip Wheeler on &#8216;Yellowstone&#8217;</h2>



<p>On <em>Yellowstone</em>, Cole Hauser portrays the character of Rip Wheeler. </p>



<p>He is the foreman of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch. He has a direct outlook on the world but a complex blend of motivations that help to make him a compelling character.</p>



<p>Cole Hauser has been a big part of bringing the character to life. There is, after all, more to acting than dressing the part and reading lines.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Cole Hauser on January 10, 2023." class="wp-image-512629" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cole Hauser attends the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 10, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Yellowstone </em>viewers can attest that Rip Wheeler (what a name) balances ruthlessness and vulnerability. Sometimes, fans find themselves rooting for people who are clearly not good people.</p>



<p>Cole Hauser has done a commendable job portraying a character whose family trauma haunts him well into adulthood. His commitment to the Duttons, who took him in, explains &#8212; but does not excuse &#8212; much of his behavior.</p>



<p>But if you think that Cole Hauser looks vaguely familiar, you&#8217;re not wrong. His acting career has spanned decades, including cult classic masterpieces like<em> Pitch Black</em>. And one role in particular comes to mind.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="662" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-1024x662.jpg" alt="Cole Hauser on May 30, 2019 while wearing a mustard yellow jacket." class="wp-image-512630" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-300x194.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-768x496.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-2048x1324.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-960x620.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-1080x698.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_03-1200x776.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cole Hauser from &#8216;Yellowstone&#8217; attends the Comedy Central, Paramount Network and TV Land summer press day  at The London Hotel on May 30, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Comedy Central, Paramount Network and TV Land)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-before-yellowstone-cole-hauser-was-part-of-the-fast-amp-furious-franchise">Before &#8216;Yellowstone,&#8217; Cole Hauser was part of the &#8216;Fast &amp; Furious&#8217; franchise</h2>



<p>Fans are hopeful for a Cole Hauser <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> return because he has been in the films before. Specifically, one film: <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>.</p>



<p>That is the second film in the series, and perhaps the one with the most famous title. Cole Hauser took on the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> role of Carter Verone, a drug lord and an all-around not good dude.</p>



<p>Several antagonists from the <em>The Fast &amp; The Furious</em> franchise have undergone character arcs that make them more sympathetic, cooperative, and likable. But Carter Verone didn&#8217;t give off those vibes. And that&#8217;s due to Cole Hauser&#8217;s portrayal of him as an unscrupulous villain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="2 Fast 2 Furious - &quot;I&#039;ll Take My Cutter Back&quot; HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgTKQpmIEKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As part of the events of <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>, Carter Verone ends up under arrest. But that doesn&#8217;t have to mean the end of Cole Hauser&#8217;s character.</p>



<p>Fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fastandfurious/comments/15ujy1v/we_need_cole_hauser_carter_verone_to_return_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> and beyond are suggesting that Cole Hauser could launch his <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> return. One commenter notes that a rich bad guy getting out of prison after 20 years is the &#8220;least unrealistic thing&#8221; for the franchise to do.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re specifically noting that Cole Hauser is getting added attention for his <em>Yellowstone </em>success. That sort of spotlight can mean that an obscure villain from a series&#8217; past can return with a vengeance.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="929" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-929x1024.jpg" alt="Devon Aoki and Eva Mendes in 2003." class="wp-image-512633" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-929x1024.jpg 929w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-272x300.jpg 272w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-768x847.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-1858x2048.jpg 1858w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-871x960.jpg 871w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-980x1080.jpg 980w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_evamendes_devonaoki_01-1088x1200.jpg 1088w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Devon Aoki and Eva Mendes pose at the premiere after-party for &#8220;2 Fast 2 Furious&#8221; at the Universal Amphitheatre on June 3, 2003.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-everyone-is-on-board-however">Not everyone is on board, however</h2>



<p>But some longtime <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> fans don&#8217;t want to see a Cole Hauser return, but it&#8217;s not because of the actor himself. He&#8217;s acquitted himself well on screens large and small.</p>



<p>Some note that, if someone from <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em> is going to return, it should be Devon Aoki or Eva Mendes. They, these fans argue, would be more interesting.</p>



<p>Also? Cole Hauser did such a good job portraying the villainous Carter Verone that offering the character a return or a redemption arc could rub some fans the wrong way. Either way, he&#8217;s doing a bang-up job on <em>Yellowstone</em>.</p>

<p>In honor of <a href="/2016/10/mean-girls-day-an-appreciation/"><em>Mean Girls</em> Day</a>, we thought there was no better time to check in on the possibility of a Mean Girls sequel.</p>



<p>In short, anyone who is anyone who was involved with the first movie wants to see a sequel happen. This includes Lindsay Lohan! </p>



<p>For the better part of the last decade or so, Lindsay has been hinting that the gang should get back together. </p>



<p>Now, with her brand being reboots and nostalgia and a few reunions already under her belt, it might just be time for a Mean Girls sequel to to finally be a thing. </p>



<p>So fetch, right? Let&#8217;s fill you in on what we know. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-lohan-s-wanted-a-mean-girls-sequel-for-years">Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s Wanted A Mean Girls Sequel For YEARS! </h2>





<p>Travel back with us, if you will, to 2016. </p>



<p>As Lindsay Lohan lives on Lindsay Lohan time, she was spotted celebrating <em>Mean Girls </em>Day a week and a half late that October with a throwback that brings to mind that girl in your Facebook feed who peaked in high school.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s back-in-the-day Lindsay along with Gretchen Wieners and Regina George.</p>



<p>Okay, considering the film came out 20 years ago, and they&#8217;re both grown-ass women in their thirties, Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert would probably prefer to be referred to by their proper names, but we just have a hard  time letting go of Tina Fey&#8217;s cult classic.</p>



<p>And it seems we&#8217;re not the only ones&#8230;</p>



<p>Lindsay posted a pic on October 13th of the Mean Girl girlies, along with a caption reading: &#8220;#tbt &#8230; miss you all&#8230; sequel?&#8221;</p>



<p>Now,  of course we know that a Insta post doesn&#8217;t mean much. Except that floated the idea out there &#8230; and some interesting things happened after that. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mean-girls-reunion-everyone-wanted-and-now-wants-more-of">The Mean Girls Reunion Everyone Wanted &#8211; And Now Wants More Of!</h2>



<p>In 2020, Lindsay, along with creator Tina Fey, and most of the original cast, reunited on October 3 for a special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU17wW4MYSU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted by Katie Couric</a> to encourage people to vote in the election. </p>



<p>A few days later, Lindsay delighted fans again as she Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried re-created their famous four-way phone call from the 2004 comedy.</p>



<p>And THEN, Lindsay returned to North Shore High along with Lacy and Amanda to reprise their characters as adults in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TUe3XWz1d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart&#8217;s Black Friday commercial</a> in 2023. </p>



<p>So you see, these ladies just can&#8217;t keep away from each other. And frankly, no one wants them to! But what about an actual MOVIE? Well, there is good news on that front. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-lohan-amp-rachel-mcadams-interested-in-making-mean-girls-sequel">Lindsay Lohan &amp; Rachel McAdams &#8216;Interested&#8217; in Making <em>Mean Girls</em> Sequel </h2>



<p>Now, glaringly absent from the Walmart ad was Rachel, who played everyone&#8217;s favorite baddie, Regina Geroge.</p>



<p>The rumor was she didn&#8217;t participate due to her schedule, but it opened up the conversation about a sequel down the line. And according to sources, it sounds like everyone&#8217;s in! </p>



<p>“She has no regrets about not doing a Walmart commercial, which is a different thing,&#8221; a source shared with <em>People Magazine</em> about Rachel. </p>



<p>&#8220;She is super busy, but likes her former cast members and would be interested in <a href="https://people.com/lindsay-lohan-rachel-mcadams-interested-in-mean-girls-sequel-20-years-later-exclusive-8641140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking about a sequel </a>if it becomes a reality.”</p>



<p>The same goes for Lindsay, who the same source said “wants to do another [<em>Mean Girls</em>] and has a good relationship with her former cast members.”  </p>



<p>“They are her friends and have been. Another film would be great for her and for audiences who loved the original.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">No question &#8211; so is anything in the works? Like a script?! </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">Funny you should ask! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lindsay-has-the-story-all-planned-out">Lindsay Has The Story All Planned Out! </h2>



<p>Yes, if you frequently read Lindsay&#8217;s interviews, and your family hasn&#8217;t yet intervened with a Kindle and a library card, then you know the actress is still hyped on the idea of a <em>Mean Girls</em> sequel.</p>



<p>Back in 2014, Linds revealed that MG2 was part of her &#8220;<a href="/2014/09/lindsay-lohan-reveals-hilarious-five-year-plan-mean-girls-2-an-o/">five year plan</a>.&#8221; (which also included an Oscar, but never mind that)</p>



<p>She even revealed she has an (extremely rough) plot outline:</p>



<p>&#8220;Like an older version where they&#8217;re all housewives and they&#8217;re all cheating,&#8221; she once told an interviewer.</p>



<p>A year later, she posted a photo from the set of the original film with a caption reading:</p>



<p>&#8220;Next step: #MEANMOMS (I&#8217;m trying to make it happen!)&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, LiLo&nbsp;is basically Gretchen Wieners when it comes to making this happen.</p>



<p>But unlike &#8220;fetch,&#8221; the idea of <em>Mean Girls 2</em> has a chance of catching on.</p>



<p>Nostalgia is all the rage these days, and Lindsay is already riding the wave with the sequel to Freaky Friday. </p>



<p>Honestly, it just makes sense to get Mean Girls 2 going next!</p>



<p>And yes, we are aware there is technically a Mean Girls 2 out there, but just like the limit, to us, it does not exist. </p>
