<p>For not the first time, TV sister Jodie Sweetin and Candace Cameron Bure find themselves on very different sides of an issue. </p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/celine-dion-paris-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony</a>, Candace posted her &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/candace-cameron-bure-olympics-opening-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgust</a>&#8221; over a particular section involving drag queens. To her, the performance as an affront to her Christian faith.</p>



<p>Despite reassurances from the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/kate-middleton-at-the-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olympics</a> committee, Candace has stirred up a fury of rage from her community  &#8211; but also, a flurry of defense from those who don&#8217;t agree with her indignation. </p>



<p>Enter Stephanie Tanner to say, in a way, &#8220;HOW RUDE!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jodie-sweetin-defends-olympics-drag-queens-after-candace-cameron-bure-blasts-disgusting-performance">Jodie Sweetin Defends Olympics Drag Queens After Candace Cameron Bure Blasts ‘Disgusting’ Performance </h2>



<p>While it’s very well documented that Candace is a Christian, so it is understood that Jodie is a fervent LGBTQ activist and ally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So it should come as no surprise that Jodie seemingly clapped back at her former <em>Full House </em>costar after the former criticized the now controversial drag show during the 2024 Olympics opening ceremony.</p>



<p>In posts over the weekend on Instagram, Candace spurned the performance which she believed was a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s painting of &#8220;The Last Supper&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She called it &#8220;completely blasphemous&#8221; and downright &#8220;disgusting&#8221;.</p>



<p>Since then, organizers have insisted that in fact, the performance was a depiction of a painting called &#8216;Feast of the Gods&#8217; by Johann Rottenhammer.</p>



<p>When Candace refused to accept this explanation and carried on ranting about how inappropriate it all was, others stepped in to play devil’s advocate. </p>

<p>That when Jodie shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jodiesweetin/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> gallery to her stories from influencer Matt Bernstein&#8217;s account highlighting the comparisons and frankly, the hypocrisy of it all. </p>



<p>“The drag queens at the olympics were re-creating the feast of Dionysus, not the last supper,” he wrote on the post Jodi shared.</p>



<p>“And even if you thought it was a christian reference &#8211; what’s the harm? Why is it a parody and not a tribute? Can drag queens not be christian too?”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-candace-digs-in-her-heels-i-m-mad">Candace Digs In Her Heels: &#8216;I&#8217;m Mad&#8217;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/simone-biles-retiring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="48">Paris Olympics</a> 2024 organizers reacted to the backlash the opening ceremony received on Sunday, July 28, offering apologies to anyone who was offended by the drag-filled performance on <em>X</em> (formerly <em>Twitter</em>).</p>



<p>That apparently wasn’t good enough for Candace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Since posting, many have tried to correct me saying it wasn’t about an interpretation of DaVinci’s The Last Supper, but a Greek god and the festival of Dionysus,” she said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9891rPRYEm/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post</a> on Monday morning. </p>

<p>Pointing to Dionysus’ being the “god of lust, insanity, religious ecstasy,” among other things, she insisted that the performance was unacceptable “for children to watch.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“In any case, I’m not buying it,” she added, rebuking the committee’s assurances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her Instagram, she carried on:</p>



<p>&#8220;It made me so sad, and someone said, &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t be sad. You should be mad about it.&#8217; I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Trust me, it makes me mad, but I&#8217;m more sad because I&#8217;m sad for souls.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I pray for my heart to break over what breaks God&#8217;s heart and I just think about all the people that have rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ or don&#8217;t know the gospel of Jesus Christ,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Candace Cameron Bure is sharing her feelings  about the Olympics as only she knows how.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 26, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/celine-dion-paris-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony</a> stunned and delighted millions of viewers all around the globe.</p>



<p>However, other spun conspiracy theories about the ceremony as it celebrated French history and culture.</p>



<p>Enter the <em>Full House</em> alum and former <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-view-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The View</em> villain</a> to the chat. Candace Cameron Bure chimed in, calling the artistic display an attack on Christians &#8211; but was it really?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-candace-cameron-bure-is-not-happy-with-the-olympics-opening-ceremony">Candace Cameron Bure is not happy with the Olympics Opening Ceremony</h2>



<p>On Saturday, the Great American Family Channel actor took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/candacecbure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story to claim that the 2024 Paris Olympics had &#8220;completely blasphemed and mock[ed] the Christian faith.&#8221;</p>



<p>She called the performance &#8220;disgusting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her issue? At one point during the performance, a collection of drag queens posed alongside a long table. Her interpretation &#8211; as was the view of many others, to be fair &#8211; was that it was a live-action riff Leonardo Da Vinci&#8217;s <em>The Last Supper</em>, a painting that depicts the final dinner of Christianity&#8217;s central figure</p>



<p>These performances almost always feature costumes and more. In this case, it included everything from Marie Antoinette (headless, of course) to French <em>Drag Race</em> stars and more. But this celebration of French history and culture ruffled feathers among evangelicals and conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Instagram Story posts automatically delete. However, allegedly at the request of her followers, Candace Cameron Bure reposted her Olympics rant to her page.</p>



<p>&#8220;You asked me to make this shareable on story, so here it is,&#8221; the actor wrote in the caption. &#8220;My take on the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since posting, many have tried to correct me saying it wasn’t about an interpretation of DaVinci’s The Last Supper,&#8221; she noted. Correct &#8212; Olympics organizers confirmed that not everyone who appears at a table is a reference to <em>that</em> Leonardo Da Vinci painting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-believes-that-olympics-organizers-are-lying-about-the-performance">She believes that Olympics organizers are lying about the performance</h2>



<p>Candace Cameron Bure acknowledged hearing that the performance at the table was not The Last Supper &#8220;but a Greek god and the festival of Dionysus; who is a god of lust, insanity, religious ecstasy, ritual [madness] etc.&#8221;</p>



<p>She complained: &#8220;I still don’t see how that relates to unifying the world through competitive sports and acceptable for children to watch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cameron Bure then spun a conspiracy theory, suggesting that organizers are lying. &#8220;In any case, I’m not buying it,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you’ll listen all the way through,&#8221; Candace Cameron Bure expressed about her Olympics rant.</p>



<p>She then penned a lengthy message for fellow Christians, concluding with: &#8220;Let us rend our hearts back to God, father of Abraham. Let us pray.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cameron Bure also tied it back into a discussion about the Olympic games with: &#8220;And pray for the Christian athletes to shine their light for the glory of God.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-was-the-opening-ceremony-bit-really-about-the-last-supper">So, Was the Opening Ceremony Bit really about The Last Supper?</h2>



<p>Answer: No.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, a group of people standing on one side of a catwalk could be a reference to Leonardo Da Vinci&#8217;s <em>The Last Supper</em>, a painting that depicts the final dinner of Christianity&#8217;s central figure.</p>



<p>But not only was that not the intention behind this section of the performance, but the symbolism isn&#8217;t secret or even subtle. &#8220;The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings,&#8221; the official <a href="https://x.com/Olympics/status/1816929100532945380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> account of The Olympic Games livetweeted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Numerous followers of Candace Cameron Bure also objected to her extreme reaction to the performance.</p>



<p>Some sought to remind her that her beliefs are not universal, and that not every piece of art is designed to either agree or disagree with her.</p>



<p>Others pointed out that the purpose of this section of the Opening Ceremony was to highlight the cultural diversity of France &#8212; and, indeed, of the world. And it seemed that the message did not hit home with Cameron Bure.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="496" height="496" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_candacecameronbure_ig_02.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of Candace Cameron Bure's Instagram replies in July 2024." class="wp-image-504911" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_candacecameronbure_ig_02.png 496w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_candacecameronbure_ig_02-300x300.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0729_candacecameronbure_ig_02-80x80.png 80w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Comments under Candace Cameron Bure&#8217;s Olympics Opening Ceremony rant on Instagram highlight how her narrow worldview causes her to take offense where there is no intention to offend.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-this-extreme-reaction-really-about">What is this extreme reaction really about?</h2>



<p>Additionally, some social media users observed that perhaps the actor&#8217;s apparent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/neal-bledsoe-exits-gaf-network-following-candace-cameron-bures-homophobic-dogwhistle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal prejudices</a> regarding the LGBTQ+ community were the larger issue. (That and, of course, her implication that portraying anyone else&#8217;s religion is not family-friendly.)</p>



<p>None of this is new. Candace Cameron Bure has repeatedly expressed the belief that she, a wealthy celebrity with numerous public platforms, experiences oppression <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/candace-cameron-bure-cancel-culture-is-real-im-a-target-because-im-a-christian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because she is a Christian</a>. Roughly two-thirds of the United States is Christian. Cameron Bure&#8217;s own God is mentioned on US currency and in courthouses.</p>



<p>Millions of Christians watched the Olympics Opening Ceremony without issue. Candace Cameron Bure may accuse them of being &#8220;lukewarm&#8221; in their faith. But it is possible that she&#8217;s the one with the faulty temperature gauge?</p>

<p>Last year, Candace Cameron Bure praised her new network&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/jojo-siwa-trashes-candace-cameron-bure-cites-remarks-about-traditional-marriage-as-rude-and-hurtful/">focus on &#8220;traditional marriage&#8221;</a> in its programming.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/neal-bledsoe-exits-gaf-network-following-candace-cameron-bures-homophobic-dogwhistle/">The homophobic dogwhistle</a> seemed to indicate that Hallmark&#8217;s endless parade of Christmas movies were somehow too un-Christian. Or perhaps <em>too inclusive</em>. Maybe, to Candace, those are the same thing.</p>



<p>A lot of people called her out over this not-so-subtle bigoted jab.</p>



<p>But Candace is labeling the backlash as &#8220;cancel culture,&#8221; decrying &#8220;divisive&#8221; media. Oh, and she&#8217;s comparing critical remarks to <em>actual persecution</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Though better known for her distant acting career and her role as a talk show antagonist, Candace Cameron Bure also likes to share her opinions on the internet. (Image Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Is the &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; in the room with us right now, Candace?</p>



<p>The <em>Full House</em> alum and former <em>The View</em> villain spoke on <a href="https://thejuliasadlershowpodcast.libsyn.com/candace-cameron-bure-on-full-house-her-faith-journey-being-a-christian-in-hollywood">the <em>Unapologetic With Julia Jeffress Sadler</em> podcast</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know there’s all the places in the world, all different countries, where people get severely persecuted for their faith,&#8221; Bure oddly commented. </p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like we’ve had this cushion here in North America,&#8221; Bure then opined. </p>



<p>She noted that we live in the US &#8220;where someone yells at us or someone says a mean, negative thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Bure expressed, &#8220;our feelings get so hurt over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cancel culture is real, and it’s difficult, and it’s hard,&#8221; Bure claimed.</p>



<p>In her opinion, people targeted her for being a Christian &#8212; one of the most culturally dominant faiths on the planet. More than 60% of Americans are Christians.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s difficult,&#8221; Bure complained about allegedly becoming a target for her faith. &#8220;And it’s hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But listen, I just want to encourage you that you are not the only one,&#8221; Bure said vaguely.</p>



<p>&#8220;And there are lots of us,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and we are always stronger together.&#8221;</p>



<p>In her mind, Christians &#8212; who have enjoyed political representation since the US government&#8217;s inception, whose God receives mention on our money and in courthouses &#8212; face special challenges when they stand up for their beliefs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Candace Cameron Bure shared this photo of herself wearing a &#8220;Not Today, Satan&#8221; shirt, which caused some controversy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bure says that despite these &#8220;challenges,&#8221; she is a big believer in leading with her heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard no matter what,&#8221; she expressed. </p>



<p>&#8220;Especially when you are a compassionate person,&#8221; Bure claimed, &#8220;and you have a heart for people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it’s important that we speak truth in love,&#8221; Bure said vaguely.</p>



<p>She explained: &#8220;’cause, listen, nobody’s gonna change, nobody’s gonna listen to you when it comes out angry, when it comes out in a harsh way.&#8221;</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that she believes in letting other people live their lives without facing bigotry. Bure added: &#8220;It’s important that we don’t back down.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="466" height="586" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-talks.jpg" alt="Candace Cameron Bure Talks" class="wp-image-249824" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-talks.jpg 466w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-talks-239x300.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-talks-266x335.jpg 266w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-talks-276x347.jpg 276w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-talks-414x520.jpg 414w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Candace Cameron Bure was never shy about offering her opinion on The View. Did you like her as a panelist?</figcaption></figure>



<p>And yes, in her mind, by stepping away from Hallmark &#8212; which only recently began telling LGBTQ+ stories after a jarringly long delay &#8212; was her standing her ground. Against, you know, other people existing.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you know what your boundaries are, that’s the most important,&#8221; she insisted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because if you don’t make them for yourself, the entertainment industry will make them for you,&#8221; Bure warned. &#8220;And that’s what you don’t want.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Bure says that she now believes that the entertainment industry is a &#8220;battlefield.&#8221; Huh.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was where I could go and make a difference in the art of my work that I get to do and look at it through a new lens, and that was to share the Lord with people,&#8221; she expressed.</p>



<p>Despite her obvious bigoted dogwhistles under a thin veneer, Bure added: &#8220;It absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would ever think I intentionally would want to offend and hurt anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It saddens me that the media is often seeking to divide us, even around a subject as comforting and merry as Christmas movies,&#8221; Bure claimed.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, given the toxic climate in our culture right now, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; she commented. Bure then claimed: &#8220;We need Christmas more than ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>A lot of that comes across as deeply disingenuous. Except for the &#8220;battlefield&#8221; part. Anyway, just a reminder that being nice to people is free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Following Candace Cameron Bure&#8217;s homophobic dogwhistle, actor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/neal-bledsoe-exits-gaf-network-following-candace-cameron-bures-homophobic-dogwhistle/">Neal Bledsoe departed the GAF network</a>.</p>



<p>Her words were not the only force behind that decision. The network&#8217;s head didn&#8217;t help matters.</p>



<p>Though many know Danica McKellar from <em>The Wonder Years</em> or <em>Young Justice</em>, much of her recent on-screen work has been on Hallmark. And, yes, on Great American Family.</p>



<p>In fact, she co-starred with Neal on multiple GAF projects. But <em>she&#8217;s</em> not going anywhere.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8230; would you believe she&#8217;s now a mathematician and respected author of four non-fiction books?</figcaption></figure>



<p>Author and actress Danica McKellar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/danica-mckellar-co-stars-exit-candace-cameron-bures-comments-traditional-marriage">spoke to <em>Fox News Digital</em></a> over the weekend about her co-star&#8217;s departure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neal is a wonderful person,&#8221; she strongly affirmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s such a great actor,&#8221; Danica praised, &#8220;and I have enjoyed working with him so much.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-683x1024.jpg" alt="Danica McKellar at the AMAs" class="wp-image-160871" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/danica-mckellar-at-the-amas-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;He and I both share our love and support of the LGBT community for sure,&#8221; Danica McKellar emphasized.</p>



<p>However, that does not mean that they see eye to eye on Candace Cameron Bure&#8217;s homophobia scandal.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with his interpretation of her comments,&#8221; Danica admitted. &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t see them the same way.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">It&#8217;s Winnie Cooper! Okay, it&#8217;s really Danica McKellar. But she&#8217;ll always be Winnie Cooper to us.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We will certainly unpack why it is no surprise that Danica and Neal might see things differently.</p>



<p>Our intention will not be to shame Danica in any way.</p>



<p>In fact, it is the nature of dogwhistles &#8212; be they homophobic, transphobic, racist, or otherwise &#8212; to rely upon people&#8217;s generosity and better natures. They&#8217;re called <em>dogwhistles </em>because some will hear the intended meaning, and others will not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Hallmark films are known for leaning conservative. Not just conservative &#8212; homogeneous.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking about a brand best known for stories about straight, white, culturally Christian people celebrating the much-hyped <em>magic of Christmas</em>.</p>



<p>But if Hallmark&#8217;s extremely recent inclusion of same-sex couples drives away bigoted viewers, Candace Cameron Bure and the Great American Family channel have an alternative.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view.jpg" alt="Candace Cameron Bure on The View" class="wp-image-249822" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view.jpg 634w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-186x300.jpg 186w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-207x335.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-215x347.jpg 215w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-322x520.jpg 322w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-396x640.jpg 396w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-476x768.jpg 476w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-on-the-view-594x960.jpg 594w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Candace Cameron Bure is pictured here on The View. She announced her departure from that show in late 2016.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just a few weeks ago, Bure announced that she is leaving Hallmark and entering a partnership with Great American Family.</p>



<p>Bure emphasized her desire for entertainment featuring &#8220;traditional family&#8221; content.</p>



<p>&#8220;Traditional family&#8221; is meaningless, because neither family nor tradition are a monolith. That ambiguity is what makes it such an effective dogwhistle &#8212; one to malign LGBTQ+ individuals, relationships, and families.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Candace Cameron Bure attends Cosmopolitan&#8217;s &#8216;Cosmo 100&#8217; luncheon held at Michael&#8217;s restaurant in New York City on December 7th, 2015.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Hallmark&#8217;s saccharine tripe about Christmas magic and love is somehow too Leftist, Bure suggests Great American Family.</p>



<p>She is not the only one there who feels that way.</p>



<p>Bill Abbott previously headed Hallmark and is now the chief executive at GAF &#8230; and seemingly referred to the LGBTQ+ community and their representation in media as a &#8220;trend.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is where Neal Bledsoe, who co-starred with Danica in The Winter Palace and Christmas at the Drive-In, comes into play.</p>



<p>He announced that he is walking away from Great American Family after starring in multiple projects.</p>



<p>Neal explained that &#8220;the thought that my work could be used to deliberately discriminate against anyone horrifies and infuriates me.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="404" height="594" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/candace-cameron-bure-at-the-peoples-choice-awards.jpg" alt="Candace Cameron Bure at the People's Choice Awards" class="wp-image-253434" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/candace-cameron-bure-at-the-peoples-choice-awards.jpg 404w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/candace-cameron-bure-at-the-peoples-choice-awards-204x300.jpg 204w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/candace-cameron-bure-at-the-peoples-choice-awards-228x335.jpg 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/candace-cameron-bure-at-the-peoples-choice-awards-236x347.jpg 236w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/candace-cameron-bure-at-the-peoples-choice-awards-354x520.jpg 354w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Candace Cameron Bure went for an elegant look at the People&#8217;s Choice Awards. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, he wasn&#8217;t writing off the network forever.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope GAF will change,&#8221; he expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;But until everyone can be represented in their films with pride,&#8221; Neal continued, &#8220;my choice is clear.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Danica may simply be giving Candace Cameron Bure the benefit of the doubt.</p>



<p>People do this a lot. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they see the good in people. Other times, it&#8217;s easier to not allow yourself to see the malice in another&#8217;s heart.</p>



<p>So Danica&#8217;s reluctance to disavow Bure or GAF could simply be rooted in not perceiving Bure&#8217;s words as malicious. That&#8217;s how dogwhistles work.</p>

<p>Some people just have a natural ability to bring everyone together with their words and ideas.</p>



<p>Candace Cameron Bure is like that. In that she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/jojo-siwa-trashes-candace-cameron-bure-cites-remarks-about-traditional-marriage-as-rude-and-hurtful/">says horrible things</a>, and everyone unites to call her out on it.</p>



<p>She recently Candace Cameron<em> Burned</em> some bridges with Hallmark, disparaging the LGBTQ+ community while partnering with a new, even more conservative network.</p>



<p>One of that network&#8217;s actors is leaving. He&#8217;ll do cheesy Christmas movies until the cows come home, but he draws the line at outright bigotry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>For most people, the Hallmark Channel and its movies are cheesy things to watch ironically. Or to watch if one of your favorite actors is in it.</p>



<p>The channel has a reputation for showcasing white, straight, Christian conservative families. That also describes their target audience.</p>



<p>Hallmark didn&#8217;t even show a same-sex kiss until 2020. Apparently, that was still too much, too soon for Candace Cameron Bure.</p>

She announced her departure from that show in late 2016.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recently, Bure announced that she was parting ways with Hallmark and partnering with Great American Family. She cited wanting programming with &#8220;traditional family,&#8221; a dogwhistle for homophobic rejection of LGBTQ+ people, partners, and families.</p>



<p>Great American Family seems to be something of a halfway house for those who think that Hallmark&#8217;s bland Christmas programming is too <em>radical </em>and <em>secular</em>.</p>



<p>Bill Abbott, who is the chief executive at GAF and previously headed Hallmark, referred to the LGBTQ+ community as a &#8220;trend.&#8221; So she&#8217;s clearly not alone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Actor Neal Bledsoe was working on Great American Family. <em>Was</em>, past tense. He has announced that he is walking away in the wake of Bure&#8217;s comments.</p>



<p>He already starred in two GAF films this year: <em>The Winter Palace</em> and <em>Christmas at the Drive-In</em>. Those will be the last.</p>



<p>This week, Bledsoe <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/neal-bledsoe-leaves-great-american-family-lgbtq-1235449812/">told <em>Variety</em></a><em> </em>that &#8220;the thought that my work could be used to deliberately discriminate against anyone horrifies and infuriates me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope GAF will change,&#8221; Bledsoe expressed.</p>



<p>&#8220;But until everyone can be represented in their films with pride,&#8221; he noted, &#8220;my choice is clear.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bledsoe continued: &#8220;I look forward to working with creators who put no limits on the stories we tell and follow through on their message of values with open arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As someone who struggled as a young man with our society’s extremely narrow definition of masculinity,&#8221; Bledsoe continued.</p>



<p>He noted that &#8220;it was [the LGBTQIA+] community that provided me with refuge and a guiding light when my life felt lost.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bledsoe affirmed: &#8220;If I cannot stand up for that community in their time of need, my debt to them means nothing.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;So, I want to be very clear: my support for the LGBTQIA+ community is unconditional,&#8221; Bledsoe emphasized.</p>



<p>He added that &#8220;nothing is worth my silence or their ability to live and love freely in a world that we are lucky enough to share with them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Notably, he did not single out Candace Cameron Bure in those quotes. In fact, he may have been responding more to Bill Abbott&#8217;s &#8220;trends&#8221; comment than to anything else. No matter what, good for Neal Bledsoe. Being a decent person isn&#8217;t always easy.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <em>Fuller House</em> actress <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/hilarie-burton-trashes-candace-cameron-bure-for-hating-on-gay-marriage-youre-a-greedy-bigot/">Candace Cameron Bure outed herself as a bigot </a>when she spoke about her reasons for leaving the Hallmark Channel in favor of the ultra-conservative Great American Family network.</p>



<p>In an interview with <em>WSJ</em> Magazine, Bure revealed that she was uncomfortable with the more progressive direction that Hallmark had taken with regard to its portrayal same-sex couples.</p>



<p>Basically, Hallmark decided to acknowledge that these couples exist, and that was too much for Candy.</p>



<p>Pro tip: When the Hallmark Channel is too edgy and raw for your delicate sensibilities, it might be time to leave your career in media behind. </p>

<p></p>



<p>“My heart wants to tell stories that have more meaning and purpose and depth behind them,” Bure told the outlet.</p>



<p>“I knew that the people behind Great American Family were Christians that love the Lord and wanted to promote faith programming and good family entertainment.”</p>



<p>Asked if GAF would follow Hallmark into the 21st century by offering more diverse content, Bure stated that her new network would would be keeping “traditional marriage at the core.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Numerous celebs were quick to call Bure out, none more memorably than Hilarie Burton, who blasted her former Hallmark colleague in a series of scathing tweets.</p>



<p>“Bigot. I don’t remember Jesus liking hypocrites like Candy,” Burton Morgan tweeted.</p>



<p>“But sure. Make your money, honey. You ride that prejudice wave all the way to the bank.”</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a shooting took place at an LGBTQIA+ club in Colorado Springs, and Burton took the opportunity to remind the Candace of the dangers of hate and bigotry.</p>



<p>“THIS! This is why we have to speak out against bigotry of any kind — even the ‘aren’t-I-cute-girl-next-door’ bulls–t that I called out last week. The bigotry of @GAfamilyTV is the most dangerous kind,” Burton tweeted on Sunday, alongside an article about the shooting.</p>



<p>“It normalizes exclusion under the guise of ‘protecting traditional values.&#8217;”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Burton went on to offer her support to those who had been affected by the shooting.</p>



<p>“To the people of Colorado Springs, I am heartbroken and sending you love and fierce support. To my LGBTQ friends? I love you,&#8221; the actress wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are perfect and made in God’s image and you deserve inclusion. To the bigots? Your ‘traditional values’ killed at least five people last night.”</p>

<p>Burton went on to blast both Bure and GAF CEO Bill Abbott.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s the excuse of white German women in the 1930s. It’s a dog whistle for protecting white supremacy,” she continued. </p>



<p>“So when Candy and Bill Abbott and GAF wanna ‘protect traditional values’ against LGBTQ influence? This is what happens. Look no further than the comments their fan base left on.”</p>

<p>Burton proceeded to head off criticism that she&#8217;s engaging in anti-Christian prejudice:</p>



<p>“I never said a word about Christianity. Newsflash: I am a lifelong Christian. But the sheer volume of people who felt emboldened to put their bigotry in writing – to live forever on the internet – was all the evidence you need,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d like to join Burton in offering our condolences to those who those who were impacted by this week&#8217;s shooting.</p>



<p>A better future is possible &#8212; and it starts with rooting out bigotry in all its forms.</p>

<p>One problem with former child stars is that too many of them continue to think their opinions are more important than everyone else&#8217;s even after they&#8217;ve slogged through decades of adult mediocrity.</p>



<p>Their parents drove them to the right audition back in 1986, and because of that, they have the ability to spew their unique brand of idiocy to like a million Twitter followers in the year of our lord 2022.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like the Butterfly Effect for anti-vax MAGA chuds.</p>



<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s a little backstory on while we&#8217;re all being forced to listen to Candace Cameron Bure&#8217;s bigotry this week.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, Candace outed herself as a homophobe this week with outrageous comments about &#8220;traditional marriage&#8221; and the importance of ousting marginalized people from mainstream television.</p>



<p>Thankfully, many celebs quickly clapped back at the <em>Full House</em> star&#8217;s foolish remarks.</p>



<p>In fact, when actress Sophia Bush criticized Cameron Bure, country star Maren Morris joined in by hilariously roasting Candace in the comments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“Make DJ [Tanner] gay again,” Morris wrote, according to Us Weekly.</p>



<p>The joke was a reference to Cameron Bure&#8217;s character on <em>Full House</em>, the crappy &#8217;90s sitcom that made her famous.</p>



<p>While the show was never what you would call &#8220;good,&#8221; it did launch the careers of several charismatic stars, including John Stamos, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, and the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/bob-sagets-daughter-posts-moving-fathers-day-tribute-he-wasnt-just-my-dad/">late, great Bob Saget</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Bob Saget and John Stamos attend The Friars Foundation Annual Applause Award Gala honoring Don Rickles back in June 24, 2013 in New York City. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;d say it did the same for Candace, but she was never charismatic or a star.</p>



<p>The meme that Bush reposted and Morris replied to is a doozy, and it comes to us courtesy of content creator Matt Bernstein.</p>



<p>“You went decades without ever having to see an LGBTQ character on screen. Now, we’re in 1 out of 5 movies. Sorry if this disturbs you. Sending thoughts and prayers,&#8221; Bernstein wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Bernstein continued:</p>



<p>&#8220;Full House’s Candace Cameron Bure has starred in Hallmark holiday films since 2008, but no more. </p>



<p>&#8220;This year — while Hallmark is releasing its first ever film featuring a gay couple — Bure has left the network, motiving to the Great American Family network (GAF) instead.</p>



<p>&#8220;What exactly does ‘traditional marriage’ mean? Is it a marriage with a 50% chance o fending in divorce? A marriage between a man, a woman, and a mistress? </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Candace Cameron Bure shared this photo of herself wearing a &#8220;Not Today, Satan&#8221; shirt, which caused some controversy. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;A marriage that doesn’t end in divorce but really should? … If you mean heterosexual, just say that.”</p>



<p>The backlash comes in response to Candace&#8217;s comments about her decision to leave the Hallmark Channel for the ultra-conservative Great American Media network.</p>



<p>“My heart wants to tell stories that have more meaning and purpose and depth behind them,” the actress told the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>earlier this month.</p>

(Photo via ABC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I knew that the people behind Great American Family were Christians that love the Lord and wanted to promote faith programming and good family entertainment.”</p>



<p>Candace criticized Hallmark&#8217;s programming and argued that the network is now “a completely different network than when I started because of the change of leadership.”</p>



<p>Former Hallmark actresses like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/hilarie-burton-trashes-candace-cameron-bure-for-hating-on-gay-marriage-youre-a-greedy-bigot/">Hilarie Burton blasted Cameron Bure for her remarks</a>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“Now they’re just openly admitting their bigotry,” the <em>One Tree Hill</em> star tweeted on Monday. </p>



<p>“I called this s–t out years ago when Abbott was at Hallmark. Glad they dumped him. Being LGBTQ isn’t a ‘trend.’ That guy and his network are disgusting. You too Candy. There is nothing untraditional about same-sex couples.”</p>



<p>Bure has yet to respond to Burton or Morris but maybe she&#8217;s just saving her strength.</p>



<p>After all, we&#8217;re sure a lot more criticism is coming her way!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>JoJo Siwa has a new reason to think VERY little of Candace Cameron Bure.</p>



<p>Back in July, the former Dance Moms standout labeled <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/jojo-siwa-destroys-candace-cameron-bure-as-rudest-celebrity-ive-met/">Bure as the rudest celebrity she had ever met</a> because the ex-Full House star once snubbed her for a photo opportunity.</p>



<p>Now, however?</p>



<p>Siwa, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/jojo-siwa-says-she-really-happy-to-be-part-of-lgbtq-community/">came out last year as bisexual</a>, has once again attacked Bure after the actress made remarks in a Wall Street Journal article about traditional marriage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Bure, you see, left the Hallmark channel in April and joined the Great American Family network in order to work on projects that “will keep traditional marriage at the core,&#8221; adding in the aforementioned article:</p>



<p>&#8220;My heart wants to tell stories that have more meaning and purpose and depth behind them. </p>



<p>&#8220;I knew that the people behind Great American Family were Christians that love the Lord and wanted to promote faith programming and good family entertainment.&#8221;</p>



<p>In response to these comments, Hilarie Burton <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/hilarie-burton-trashes-candace-cameron-bure-for-hating-on-gay-marriage-youre-a-greedy-bigot/">labeled Bure as a hypocrite and a bigot</a>.</p>

<p>As for Siwa, who already had issues with Bure?</p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly, I can&#8217;t believe after everything that went down just a few months ago, that she would not only create a movie with intention of excluding LGBTQIA+, but then also talk about it in the press,&#8221; Siwa wrote on social media.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is rude and hurtful to a whole community of people.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perfectly said, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Siwa&#8217;s critique of her rival was applauded by fellow Dance Moms alum Maddie Ziegler, who commented, &#8220;go off jojo!!!!!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Cameron Bure&#8217;s former Full House costar Jodie Sweetin even shared her support for Siwa in the comments, writing: &#8220;You know I love you,&#8221; along with a red heart emoji.</p>



<p>Natasha Bure, the 24-year old daughter of the veteran actress, conversely, is sticking by her mother&#8217;s side.</p>



<p>As one would expect her to, right?</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you @candacecbure for continuously choosing Christ before all,&#8221; Natasha wrote in a November 15 Instagram post, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;I applaud you every time for how you handle yourself with the upmost grace. As they continuously twist the narrative to beat down on the Kingdom, you stand firm in faith.&#8221;</p>



<p>Natasha added that words often get twisted, a development she thinks is &#8220;so incredibly sad to watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Hallmark announced it had plans to show a more diverse lineup, including movies with LGBTQIA+ leads.</p>



<p>Hence, Bure&#8217;s decision to walk away.</p>



<p>Bill Abbott, chief executive of Great American Media — who used to head Hallmark — appeared to confirm Bure’s comments above, stating of whether or not his network will focus on same-sex couples:</p>



<p>“It’s certainly the year 2022, so we’re aware of the trends. There’s no whiteboard that says, ‘Yes, this’ or ‘No, we’ll never go here.&#8217;”</p>

<p>Remember a few months ago when JoJo Siwa said Candace <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/jojo-siwa-destroys-candace-cameron-bure-as-rudest-celebrity-ive-met/">Cameron Bure was the rudest celebrity</a> she&#8217;s ever met?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got a feeling that Hilarie Burton would now echo that sentiment.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal published a profile on the Fuller House actress&#8230; in which Bure explained her decision to start doing holiday movies for the Great American Family Channel instead of the Hallmark Channel.</p>



<p>What was the basis behind this move? </p>

<p>Bure told the aforementioned outlet that this little-known network is filled with &#8220;Christians that love the Lord and want to promote faith programming and good family entertainment.&#8221;</p>



<p>The actress then criticized Hallmark, calling it &#8220;a completely different network than when I started because of the change of leadership,&#8221; prior to claiming same-sex couples likely wouldn&#8217;t be featured in Great American Family&#8217;s programming. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core,&#8221; Bure said.</p>



<p>Upon seeing this quote, Burton entered the online fray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bigot. I don&#8217;t remember Jesus liking hypocrites like Candy,&#8221; wrote Burton on Twitter, adding of her acting counterpart:</p>



<p>&#8220;But sure. Make your money, honey. You ride that prejudice wave all the way to the bank.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>For the record, Burton used to star in Hallmark films and recently made the switch to Lifetime.</p>



<p>Bill Abbott, chief executive of Great American Media &#8212; who used to head Hallmark &#8212; appeared to confirm Bure&#8217;s comments above, stating of whether or not his network will focus on same-sex couples:</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly the year 2022, so we&#8217;re aware of the trends. </p>

<p>Continued Burton, responding to both Bure and Abbott:</p>



<p>&#8220;Now they&#8217;re just openly admitting their bigotry. I called this s&#8212; out years ago when Abbott was at Hallmark.</p>



<p>&#8220;Glad they dumped him. Being LGBTQ isn&#8217;t a &#8216;trend.&#8217; </p>



<p>&#8220;That guy and his network are disgustig [sic]. You too Candy. There is nothing untraditional about same-sex couples.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Abbott and Bure spoke with Variety in September about Great American Family, saying at the time that its primary focus at first will be Christmas and Christianity. </p>



<p>“I think we know the core audience and what they love is exactly how Bill originally built the Hallmark Channel,&#8221; Bure said back then. </p>



<p>&#8220;That was Christmas and those traditional holidays, so that’s what the focus is going to be. You’ve got to start somewhere. </p>



<p>&#8220;You can’t do everything at once.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/jojo-siwa-destroys-candace-cameron-bure-as-rudest-celebrity-ive-met/">JoJo Siwa identified Candace Cameron Bure as the &#8220;rudest celebrity&#8221;</a> she has met.</p>



<p>The teen performer didn&#8217;t accuse her of being a bad person. She just recalled a memorably unpleasant run-in.</p>



<p>Since then, the simple comment spurred a feud, with Candace and her strangely crotchety daughter both responding.</p>



<p>Now, JoJo&#8217;s mother is throwing her hat into the ring. It turns out that Jessalynn Siwa has told this story before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>On Monday, August 1, Jessalynn took to Instagram to share a clip from her own podcast, <em>Success With Jess</em>.</p>



<p>This was an older clip, she explained, but absolutely on-topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;I talked about this on my podcast a while back,&#8221; Jessalynn noted in the caption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;The recent story told wasn’t quite right,&#8221; Jessalynn explained, &#8220;so here is the real version.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At the end of the day this story,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;it’s not about a simple photo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jessalyn reasoned: &#8220;It’s about how you treat people.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="664" height="556" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited.jpg" alt="Candace Cameron Bure Gets Excited" class="wp-image-249826" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited.jpg 664w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited-300x251.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited-335x281.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited-347x291.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited-520x435.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/candace-cameron-bure-gets-excited-640x536.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /><figcaption>Candace Cameron Bure sure is excited about something in this photo from The View.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Real, genuine kindness always goes a long way,&#8221; she pointed out.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s super easy to quote a Bible verse when everyone is looking at you,&#8221; Jessalyn quipped.</p>



<p>She then wisely continued: &#8220;But morals are what you have when no one is looking.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>JoJo Siwa is a former Dance Moms star who acts like a cartoon version of a small child although she is 15.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the video itself, Jessalynn spoke about JoJo&#8217;s encounter with Candace when JoJo was just a tween.</p>



<p>“First of all, I have been obsessed with her since the premiere episode of Full House,&#8221; she affirmed.</p>



<p>Jessalynn&#8217;s disclaimer continued: &#8220;And second of all, JoJo was obsessed with her.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Candace Cameron Bure shared this photo of herself wearing a &#8220;Not Today, Satan&#8221; shirt, which caused some controversy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“So it’s still cool, we still like her,&#8221; Jessalynn emphasized, reiterating JoJo&#8217;s sentiments.</p>



<p>In the video, she explained: &#8220;It was just a bad moment.”</p>



<p>This happened, of course, at a premiere for <em>Fuller House</em> in Los Angeles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The cast and crew of &#8216;Fuller House&#8217; &#8211; Jeff Franklin, John Stamos, Lori Loughlin, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos, Michael Campion, Candace Cameron Bure, Elias Harger, Soni Bringas, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Juan Pablo Di Pace at the series premiere in Los Angeles on February 16th, 2016.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was awesome and quaint,&#8221; Jessalynn described. &#8220;There’s not a lot of people there.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;All of the people from the show are there [and] they show you two episodes. It was so fun.” </p>



<p>Jessalynn narrated: “After that we were all upstairs on the balcony.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>JoJo Siwa did the &#8220;Wipe It Down&#8221; TikTok Challenge the day before her 17th birthday, smiling in fake surprise at her natural look.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Uncle Jesse [John Stamos] was there, Joey [Dave Coulier] and Stephanie [Jodie Sweetin],&#8221; Jessalynn listed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And everyone was taking pictures,&#8221; she shared. &#8220;It was amazing.”</p>



<p>The party then moved on to a smaller venue, where things became &#8220;crowded.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/0803-Jessalynn-Siwa-Podcast.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Jessalynn recalled, &#8220;JoJo ran into DJ and was like, ‘Oh, my God, I love you so much. Can we please take a selfie?’&#8221; </p>



<p>She described: &#8220;And she was like, ‘Not now. Maybe later.’ Word for word &#8212; ‘Not now, maybe later.’”</p>



<p>This led to Jessalynn joking that JoJo should give Candace the same response if she one day wants a selfie.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Ultimately, like her daughter, she&#8217;s not accusing Candace of being a bad person. She acknowledged that being a celebrity is &#8220;hard.&#8221;</p>



<p>But they&#8217;d liked Candace for years. In just a few seconds, she gave mother and daughter a very different impression of her.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a big deal. But JoJo has every right to describe her experiences with people.</p>
