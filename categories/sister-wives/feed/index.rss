<p>Garrison Brown would have turned 27 years old on April 10.</p>



<p>We phrase it that way, of course, because the occasional Sister Wives cast member took his own life about 13 months ago&#8230; having died of a self-inflicted gun shot, according to local police in New Mexico.</p>



<p>The tragedy has left mother Janelle Brown reeling.</p>



<p>On Thursday, meanwhile, she took to social media in order to honor her late son on this occasion.</p>

<p>“You seem so alive in the millions of photos I have. I sometimes forget I won’t see you again — and then I remember, Grief is so strange,” the 55-year wrote via Instagram &#8212; alongside a carousel of photos where Garrison is smiling from ear to ear. </p>



<p>“I’ve loved all the remembrances of you posted by family and friends. And I had to re-share the reel from the county fair because it shows who you were so well. Till we meet again sweetheart.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle has been forced to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/janelle-brown-mourns-late-son-6-months-after-tragic-suicide/">pen tributes such as these</a> on numerous occasions since she lost Garrison.</p>



<p>The Browns as a whole, for the most understandable reasons possible, have not moved past the young man&#8217;s passing.</p>

<p>For example, Hunter Brown also honored his brother with a heartfelt birthday message about one year after his tragic death at 25.</p>



<p>“Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory,” Hunter wrote on Instagram, referencing a quote from Dr. Seuss. </p>



<p>“Remember to spend the time you have with those you love! Happy Birthday to my Boi! Love you, dude!”</p>



<p>In his post, Hunter added photos from over the years, featuring some of his favorite Garrison memories.</p>

<p>Garrison was one of six children shared by Janelle and her ex-husband, Kody Brown. His siblings include Logan, 30, Madison, 29, Hunter, 27, Gabriel, 23, and Savanah, 20.</p>



<p>In March 2024, The Coconino County Medical Examiner confirmed that Garrison died from a gunshot wound to the head, with his death officially ruled a suicide. </p>



<p>The report also noted ethanol intoxication &#8212; commonly known as alcohol poisoning &#8212; as a contributing factor.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just so, so sad all around.</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/janelle-brown-i-was-stunned-by-my-sons-suicide/">Janelle opened up to People Magazine</a> about Garrison&#8217;s suicide.</p>



<p>“We just had no idea that he was in that place,” Janelle told People of her son&#8217;s mental health last year, adding that “substance abuse” likely played a role in his state of mind prior to his death. “But he didn’t ever express any kind of extreme sad feelings.”</p>



<p>In a text message the night before he died, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/garrison-brown-admits-to-suicidal-tendencies-in-heartbreaking-final-text-messages/">Garrison did admit to suicidal tendencies</a>… which prompted Janelle to ask son Gabe to go check on his brother.</p>



<p>He did so, and discovered Garrison&#8217;s body.</p>



<p>“It just wasn’t for lack of love or lack of anything,” Janelle added months ago of Garrison taking his own life.</p>



<p>“And all I can do is think… we always ask ourselves could we have done something more, but I don’t know. I think that’s a grief trap because I think, ultimately, everybody is responsible for their own actions and their own decisions. But we did everything.</p>



<p>“We really did everything that we could have done. And unfortunately, sometimes [that] still isn’t enough.”</p>

<p>There&#8217;s peace at last between Kody Brown and his former sister wives.</p>



<p>At least when it comes to any potential legal battles.</p>



<p>As fans of this reality series know well, there&#8217;s long been a dispute over the status of Coyote Pass&#8230; a piece of land in Arizona that Kody purchased for $820,000 in 2018.</p>



<p>The idea was to build some sort of compound on this property for himself and spouses Robyn, Christine, Janelle and Meri.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="735" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-1024x735.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522677" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-300x215.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-768x551.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-960x689.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-1080x775.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy-1200x861.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-984251859_0e943c-copy.jpg 1392w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown looks very disturbed in this photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Nothing has come of the planned project since, however, while three of the four aforementioned women have walked away from their polygamous husband since that time.</p>



<p>Of late, both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meri-brown-threatens-kody-beware-ill-sue/">Janelle and Meri have threatened</a> lawsuits against Kody when it comes to Coyote pass, as the women aim to ensure that they see some money from any future sale.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/13925152/sister-wives-kody-brown-settles-land-war-janelle-meri/">court records obtained</a> by The U.S. Sun, however, these concerns have appeared to have been assuaged.</p>



<p>This outlet reports that two of the five parcels of land Kody purchased seven years ago were transferred from grantors Kody and Robyn to grantees Kody, Robyn, Janelle and Meri on March 26&#8230; meaning the <strong>property is now in all four of their names.</strong></p>



<p>“As long as that property remains a source of contention, I can’t fully move on,” Janelle says a new preview for the back half of Sister Wives Season 19&#8230; prior to Meri opening up to her former sister wife about her own feelings on the topic.</p>



<p>“Janelle, I’m so mad,” Meri states. “I’m gonna have to get some lawyers involved.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="501" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-1024x501.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-522312" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-1024x501.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-300x147.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-768x376.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-960x470.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-1080x528.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown seems very happy to have left Kody behind.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These scenes were filmed months ago, it&#8217;s important to note.</p>



<p>Those documents published in part by The Sun read of the two parcels, “Kody Winn Brown and Robyn Alice Brown, Husband and Wife, as Community Property with Right of Survivorship, as to an undivided 50% interest.</p>



<p>“Janelle Brown, an Unmarried Woman, as to an undivided 25% interest and Meri Caroline Brown, An Unmarried Woman, as to an undivided 25% interest the following real properties.”</p>



<p>As for the third parcel, Kody and Janelle are listed as the grantors transferring the land in Janelle and Meri’s names in the amount of $10.</p>



<p><em>Janelle Brown, An Unmarried Woman, as to an undivided 50% interest and Meri Caroline Brown, An Unmarried Woman, as to an undivided 50% interest.</em></p>



<p>The final parcel remains in just Kody and Robyn’s name; the two remain legally married.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-10.41.02%E2%80%AFAM-909x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-518896"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is interviewed here by TLC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The U.S. Sun previously reported Christine signed over the parcel in her name to Kody and Robyn Back July 28, 2022, Christine signed over her parcel of land to Kody and Robyn for just $10.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s married at this point to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a> and just wants to move on with her life.</p>



<p>(We must note, though, that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/christine-brown-lawsuit-against-kody-deemed-significant-custody-dispute-by-court/">Christine is suing Kody</a> for a very different reason.)</p>



<p>Kody never started construction of any kind on Coyote Pass and it looks like the plan now is just to sell the whole thing to the highest bidder.</p>



<p>“It’s come to the point where the family is not going to live here. Robyn was the last to give up on the dream. But she’s finally consented, ‘Yeah let’s go ahead and sell,'&#8221; Kody says in a trailer for upcoming episodes, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;I paid for the entire lot myself. When I sell, I’m going to divide the money four ways. My wife, me and the two exes. I think they’re worried whether I’m going to be fair or not, because divorce takes away the trust. But I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it stands right now, Kody Brown may soon have more lawsuits on his hands than he has wives at home.</p>



<p>First, as previously detailed, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/christine-brown-lawsuit-against-kody-deemed-significant-custody-dispute-by-court/">Christine Brown is suing</a> her ex-spouse for child support.</p>



<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/robyn-brown-questions-meri-sister-wives-trailer/">revealed in a trailer</a> for the back half of Sister Wives Season 19, we see that Meri Brown may also be taking legal action against the father of 18.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="501" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-1024x501.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-522312" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-1024x501.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-300x147.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-768x376.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-960x470.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19-1080x528.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Meri-Brown-season-19.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown seems very happy to have left Kody behind.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This trailer was released a few days ago.</p>



<p>In the sneak peek, it quickly becomes evident that Meri and Kody are at major odds over the division of Coyote Pass, the parcel of land Kody and company purchased way back in 2018.</p>



<p>No construction ever took place on the property.</p>



<p>Fast forward all this time and Kody is only still married to Robyn Brown and clearly no compound will ever be built there, which has created quite a messy issue.</p>



<p>What will happen to it? And how will the money from a potential sale be divided among the Browns?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Meri Brown gestures outdoors on Sister Wives." class="wp-image-521872" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_sisterwives_01_meribrown-Cropped.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gesturing dramatically on Season 19 of Sister Wives, Meri Brown discusses the future of what was once a shared marital property.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“As long as that property remains a source of contention, I can&#8217;t fully move on,&#8221; Janelle Brown says in this preview prior to Meri opening up to her former sister wife about her own feelings on the topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Janelle, I&#8217;m so mad,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna have to get some lawyers involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cut to a voiceover by Meri and Kody&#8217;s first wife referencing his current wife, Robyn, and stating:</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a few things that I will fight for, and this is one of them. There&#8217;s so many people that are like, &#8216;She was a liar. She was manipulating.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, the concern is that only Robyn and Kody will profit from a Coyote Pass sale.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="995" height="756" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg" alt="Kody Brown versus Meri Brown" class="wp-image-507193" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy.jpg 995w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-768x584.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/rs_1024x759-240814024428-kodymeri-copy-960x729.jpg 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown and Meri Brown on Sister Wives Season 19.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Kody and Robyn are also featured in the trailer&#8230;  reacting to Meri&#8217;s ongoing fight for her portion of Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to rip you off, Meri,&#8221; Kody says in a confessional, while Robyn addresses the camera and tries to play all innocent as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I always had Meri&#8217;s back, even when people were plotting against her, ignoring her,&#8221; she adds.</p>



<p>For those in need of a refresher:</p>



<p>Meri was Kody’s first wife, but Kody filed to divorce her in 2010 so that he could marry Robyn instead. The couple then split after 32 years of marriage in December 2022&#8230; mere days after Kody and his second wife, Janelle, announced <em>they</em> were parting ways. </p>



<p>Christine started all of this, of course, walking away from Kody and their unhealthy relationship in November 2021. </p>



<p><strong>New episodes of Sister Wives kick off on Sunday, April 20 at 9/8c on TLC.</strong></p>

<p>We have an update on Sister Wives Season 19.</p>

<p>According to an announcement made this past Friday on The Sarah Fraser Show, the network will dedicate a full episode this spring to the life and legacy of Garrison Brown.</p>



<p>The 25-year old died just over a year ago from a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">self-inflicted gunshot wound</a>.</p>



<p>Reading a press release from TLC, Fraser stated that Garrison’s death will be addressed via some kind of unique installment, although she did not say for certain just when it will originally air.</p>



<p>“As the season progresses, the family must face a tragic loss with the death of their son, Garrison,” the press release reads. </p>



<p>“In moments of reflection and honor, family members come together to share cherished moments, visit places significant to their past, and commemorate his life.”</p>

<p>The nine new Season 19 episodes that will debut on April 20 will <em>also</em> include four “Tell-All” specials, featuring one-on-one episodes with host Suki Krishnan.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the popular season will return for Season 20.</p>



<p>As for the trailer released a few days ago by producers of Sister Wives?</p>



<p>“I had this bond with her,” Meri says in the footage, referencing Kody Brown&#8217;s sole remaining spouse, Robyn. “I’m now questioning, why tell me that you want to have a relationship with me and then ghost me?”</p>

<p>The 54-year-old &#8212; who shares son Leon Brown with Kody &#8212; confesses in the preview that there have always been concerns about Robyn’s intentions from those around her&#8230; especially after Meri agreed to legally divorce Kody in 2010 so Robyn could marry him and Kody could adopt her kids from a previous relationship.</p>



<p>“There are so many people that are like, ‘She was a liar. She was manipulating,'&#8221; Meri says.</p>



<p>As always, however, Kody will be standing staunchly by his wife&#8217;s side.</p>



<p>“I’m so sick and tired of being guilted for loving Robyn,&#8221; he says in this same teaser.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, members of the Brown family paid tribute on their own accord to Garrison &#8212; on the one-year anniversary of his death. </p>



<p>His grieving mother was one of the first of these loved ones to post about Garrison via social media on March 5.</p>



<p>“I stay busy but in EVERY quiet moment you are first and foremost in my thoughts,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/janelle-brown-honors-son-garrison-on-1-year-anniversary-of-his-suicide/">Jenelle wrote at the time</a>. “It’s been a year baby. We miss you so much. I miss you so much.”</p>



<p><strong>May Garrison Brown rest in peace.</strong></p>

<p>Coyote Pass drama has Robyn Brown &#8220;questioning&#8221; where she stands with Meri.</p>



<p>In the new <em>Sister Wives</em> trailer for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/sister-wives-canceled-season-19-plan-stirs-up-controversy-confusion-among-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the remainder of Season 19</a>, we&#8217;re seeing how dividing marital property doesn&#8217;t get <em>simpler </em>in a plural marriage.</p>



<p>Meri is threatening legal action &#8212;  especially since Kody seems to think that he&#8217;s the sole decider for Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Robyn is reeling from Meri&#8217;s attitude, and wondering if they were ever really friends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-brown-is-not-a-happy-camper-on-sister-wives">Meri Brown is not a happy camper on &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217;</h2>



<p>On Thursday, March 20, TLC released the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHbOkYbseDK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> for the remainder of <em>Sister Wives </em>Season 19.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the teaser clip, Meri Brown and Janelle Brown are reflecting upon the seemingly unending Coyote Pass drama.</p>



<p>“As long as that property remains a source of contention, I can’t fully move on,” Janelle admits to the confessional camera.</p>

<p>Janelle was not the only ex feeling stuck. Meri Brown told her that she felt &#8220;so mad,&#8221; even suggesting legal action.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna have to get some lawyers involved,&#8221; she threatened.</p>



<p>“There’s a few things that I will fight for, and this is one of them,” Meri continued. “There’s so many people that are like, ‘She was a liar. She was manipulating.’” (Not all of the context is clear; this is a trailer)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-robyn-brown-is-questioning-her-bond-with-meri">Now, Robyn Brown is &#8216;questioning&#8217; her &#8216;bond&#8217; with Meri</h2>



<p>“I always had Meri’s back,&#8221; Robyn Brown insisted during the trailer.</p>



<p>Kody&#8217;s sole remaining wife insisted that this remained true &#8220;even when people were plotting against her, ignoring her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Robyn stated that she and Meri always had a &#8220;bond,&#8221; one that she was &#8220;now questioning.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>“Why tell me that you want to have a relationship with me and then ghost me?” Robyn Brown asked, seemingly continuing to voice her frustrations over Meri.</p>



<p>As you might guess, Kody Brown insisted that he was &#8220;not trying to rip&#8221; off Meri Brown when it comes to the shattered homestead dreams on Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>Discussion of Coyote Pass has dominated many seasons. In Season 19, it&#8217;s more about what becomes of the property now that Kody&#8217;s plural marriage is now singular.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-will-become-of-coyote-pass">What will become of Coyote Pass?</h2>



<p>Earlier this season, it was clear that Meri and Janelle Brown do not believe that Kody &#8212; or Robyn, or anyone &#8212; gets to unilaterally decide what becomes of the property.</p>



<p>“I don’t think you get to decide what we do with it,” Meri stressed. “Sorry, you are not the head of my family.”</p>



<p>The only person with no skin in this game is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/christine-brown-book-cover-unveiled-cleavage-heavy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine</a>, who sold her portion to Kody and Robyn for a whopping $10. Sometimes, taking the loss is worth it to wash your hands of a messy, miserable situation.</p>



<p><em>Sister Wives</em> Season 19 resumes on April 20.</p>

<p>Garrison Brown has received a new tribute from a close relative.</p>



<p>As the family continues to mourn, they also find ways to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honor his memory</a>.</p>



<p>Late last year, Maddie <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/maddie-brown-pregnant-with-baby-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed her pregnancy</a>. This is Baby #4!</p>



<p>Now, she has welcomed her baby &#8230; and the name appears to be a tribute to her late brother.</p>

<p>“Absolutely worth the wait, Miss Emilia Estelle Brush has finally made her grand entrance!” she captioned a precious baby photo.</p>

<p>Maddie detailed: &#8220;Born on 3/14, she arrived absolutely perfect.&nbsp;We are completely smitten with our newest little love.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-that-name-a-tribute-to-garrison-brown">Is that name a tribute to Garrison Brown?</h2>



<p>As fans mused over the name Emilia Estelle Brush, many latched onto the middle name and its connection to the late Garrison Brown.</p>



<p>Most English-speakers likely recognize Estelle as meaning &#8220;star.&#8221; </p>



<p>And a series of commenters drew a connection to Maddie&#8217;s dearly departed brother.</p>

<p>“She’s adorable, I love her name especially Estelle,” wrote one Instagram commenter.</p>



<p>“Is it like a tribute to Garrison since Estelle means Star in Latin,&#8221; the commenter asked. &#8220;Either way her and her name are adorable.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maddie then confirmed that the name is an homage to Garrison Brown, replying: “ … that is exactly what it is.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-a-beautiful-tribute">What a beautiful tribute</h2>



<p>Garrison Brown died by suicide on March 5, 2024 &#8212; and Emilia was born just days after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/janelle-brown-honors-son-garrison-on-1-year-anniversary-of-his-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the one year anniversary</a>. He was only 25 years old.</p>



<p>In addition to his famous passion for rescuing cats, he was also known for sharing stellar photography. Many fans remember him fondly for this &#8212; and so, clearly, do his mourning family members.</p>



<p>This was a beautiful way to honor Garrison. </p>



<p>Estelle also just happens to be a beautiful name (first or middle), making this a doubly tasteful choice.</p>

<p>Via People Magazine, the Sister Wives star unveiled <a href="https://people.com/christine-brown-woolley-new-memoir-see-the-cover-exclusive-11689766">the book cover</a> this week, with at least two notable items standing out:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Christine is using her married last name. The cover has this author listed as Christine Brown Woolley.</li>



<li>Christine is showing off a great deal of cleavage. No judgment. Just an observation.</li>
</ol>



<p>According to the official synopsis, also published by People, Brown Woolley &#8220;had always dreamed of having a picture-perfect family &#8212; beautiful children, an adoring husband, and of course, a sisterhood of wives to share him with.</p>



<p>This family image was heavily informed by her own Utah household growing up, continues the rundown: </p>



<p>&#8220;Christine knew her life was less than normal, but that didn&#8217;t stop her from loving the full house of her childhood any less.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine married Kody Brown back in 1994&#8230; in the spiritual sense, that is.</p>



<p>After welcoming six kids with the polygamist, Christine was the first of Kody&#8217;s four sister wives to walk away in November 2021.</p>



<p>Just about two years later, the TLC personality married <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want a partnership,&#8221; she told People prior to meeting and falling for her now-husband. &#8220;I want a guy who actually loves me [and] wants to be with me intimately.&#8221;</p>

<p>One month ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/christine-brown-teases-gritty-honest-memoir-order-it-now-sister-wives-fans/">Christine broke her silence</a> about this project.</p>



<p>“It is gritty and honest as I tell my story living polygamy as a child, to my marriage and family life. It shows my heartache with leaving religion and my marriage to FINALLY meeting David,&#8221; Brown wrote as a caption to a number of photos on Instagram at the time.</p>

<p><em>Becoming Kody Brown’s third wife in 1994, Christine finally found the big, happy family she had hoped for. When TLC’s hit show Sister Wives premiered in 2010, Christine knew it was her chance to shine a light on the brighter side of polygamy—the helping hands, the lively discussions, and their unmatched devotion to each other.</em></p>



<p><em>But the cameras also revealed a much darker truth.</em></p>



<p><em>In this candid tell-all, Christine shares for the first time the journey that led her away from the Morman church and the bold path she is carving to live apart from all she has ever known.</em></p>



<p><em>Moving, genuine, and insightful, this is a uniquely powerful tour de force of Christine’s journey toward and beyond her time in the spotlight as a sister wife.</em></p>

<p>Janelle Brown has shared a new message about her late son.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star did so on the most heartbreaking of occasions: The one-year anniversary of Garrison Brown taking his own life.</p>



<p>“I stay busy but in EVERY quiet moment you are first and foremost in my thoughts. It’s been a year baby,” Janelle wrote via Instagram on Wednesday, March 5&#8230;. alongside a photo of her late son smiling while holding one of his cats. </p>



<p>“We miss you so much.”</p>

<p>As most readers likely know by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">Garrison committed suicide in early 2024</a> via self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>



<p>In memory of her son, Janelle has often taken to social media on various occasions to pay Garrison tribute.</p>



<p>For example, his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-sends-message-to-late-son-on-first-christmas-without-him/">mom took some time late last year</a> to commemorate Garrison on Instagram Stories, sharing a set of photos of her family together taken on Christmas Eve in 2023.</p>



<p>“Miss you so much sweetheart,” Brown wrote alongside the lovely snapshot. “I am so beyond grateful we were all together last year and got pictures.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510011" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-960x540.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/unnamed.jpg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown is deep in thought on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In this latest case, the TLC personality encouraged her followers to consider making a donation to their local animal shelter, rescue or humane society, adding: </p>



<p>“This cause was close to Garrison’s heart &#8212; he adopted all three of his cats from shelters.”</p>



<p>Garrison was only 25 years old at the time of his passing.</p>



<p>Horribly, his younger brother, Gabriel Brown, found the young man on the morning of March 5 in his home in Flagstaff, Arizona after Janelle asked if one of her children could check on Garrison.</p>



<p>Janelle and ex-spouse Kody Brown broke their silence about their son’s death in a shared statement on their separate Instagram accounts, which read as follows:</p>



<p>“Kody and I are deeply saddened to announce the loss of our beautiful boy Robert Garrison Brown. He was a bright spot in the lives of all who knew him. His loss will leave such a big hole in our lives that it takes our breath away. We ask that you please respect our privacy and join us in honoring his memory.”</p>

<p>As it turns out, Garrison was struggling with alcohol dependence and Depression around this time last year.</p>



<p>Janelle, as mentioned previously, has made a point to honor Garrison on every major occasion since his death.</p>



<p>She previously opened up about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/">celebrating the holidays without Garrison</a> after she and her family got together for Thanksgiving.</p>



<p>After everyone packed their bags and left Janelle’s home, the Sister Wives cast member dedicated an Instagram post to Garrison… along with a throwback picture of him as a child.</p>



<p>“First of the ‘big’ holidays without you sweetheart. We all gathered in NC to celebrate together and kept your photo close by,” Janelle captioned her December 1 post.</p>



<p>“We laughed about your silly sense of humor and told so many stories honoring you. We ate, played games and enjoyed each other’s company. Everyone is returning home now and normal life resumes tomorrow. But I feel you close by.”</p>

<p>For his part, Kody has not said nearly as much about this tragedy.</p>



<p>However, he did talk to People Magazine prior to the premiere of the latest Sister Wives season, saying &#8220;it’s strange having your child pass&#8221; and adding:</p>



<p>“The wave of grief is different that any wave of grief I have ever had with a best friend passing, with a relative passing. It’s different. And it is different in the idea that it’s irreconcilable — the future that we missed with him.”</p>



<p>In looking back at the time he <em>did</em> spend with his son (the two were estranged when Garrison died) <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sister-wives-kody-brown-garrison-death/">Kody tried to remember</a> the part about him that he’ll miss the most, telling People:</p>



<p>“I want to go out to dinner again. I want to sit down. I want to have a beer. I want him to try and make me laugh because he was kind of that way. The only regret is just, gosh, I would just do that more often,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>“The only regret is that you didn’t do something. You didn’t take more time.”</p>

<p>As she&#8217;s made clear so many times in the past, Janelle Brown has no regrets.</p>



<p>Like, none at all, folks.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives cast member has been single for about three years now, having walked away from spiritual spouse Kody in early 2022.</p>



<p>Not just walked away, mind you. Janelle also <em>moved</em> away.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-514809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown has made the astute decision to walk away from Kody.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/janelle-brown-im-moving-on-in-2025/">Brown now lives near her daughter</a> in North Carolina.</p>



<p>In a new blog entry on behalf of her business, Taeda Farms, Janelle gushes over the difference in living on her own these days… versus how she was stuck for so long in a polygamous household and family.</p>



<p>“For the first time, I get to create a home that feels exactly like me,” Janelle wrote online this week, explaining that &#8220;when you’re part of a large family, decisions are never just about what you want.”</p>



<p>Truth be told, decisions for the Browns were <em>always</em> about what Kody wanted.</p>

<p>“Everything had to go through some kind of committee decision, and larger family gatherings were always factored in,” Janelle went on via this blog. </p>



<p>“There were other voices to consider, other needs to meet, and resources to share. Kody had his opinions, of course, and beyond that, everything had to fit within the broader dynamic of the family. Compromise was just part of the deal.”</p>



<p>Janelle went on to compare her previous experiences to her ongoing one, telling fans “it’s completely different” because she gets to make all the choices for her new home and no longer has to “justify” her choices to fit someone else’s vision.</p>



<p>Yes, we&#8217;re looking at you again, Kody.</p>

<p>Added Janelle:</p>



<p>“I can build a space that reflects exactly what I want, how I live, and what makes me feel at home. And let me tell you &#8212; that’s both exhilarating and a little overwhelming.”</p>



<p>Brown, of course, has been living with every parent&#8217;s worst nightmare for several months now after son Garrison <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-honors-late-son-garrison-on-thanksgiving-i-feel-you-close-by/">took his own life in March 2024</a>.</p>



<p>This tragedy helped propel Janelle to make her move, as she is now closer to one of her children on the East Coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the first time, I get to figure it out without worrying about anyone else’s opinion,” Janelle also told followers a few days ago. </p>



<p>“And I can’t wait to see this home take shape &#8212; brick by brick, choice by choice, completely mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Amen, Janelle. You deserve it.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/janelle-brown-im-done-with-men-forever/">Janelle Brown said she was done with men</a> forever.</p>



<p>While fans wait to see if that prediction sticks, many are now looking at the upcoming TLC schedule and wondering:</p>



<p><strong><em>Wait. Is TLC done with Sister Wives forever?!?</em></strong></p>

<p>Almost quietly, the long-running reality show has gone on hiatus.</p>



<p>The program aired an episode on February 2 and then left viewers curious about what was going on because there was no preview for the next all-new installment.</p>



<p><strong>As it turns out, this is because TLC does not have any all-new installments on the schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Sister Wives will actually air more episodes than it has in the past to complete Season 19, with a second half set to run some time this spring.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s concerning, however, that there is no return date at the moment; and it&#8217;s even concerning to some that the added episodes are meant to tie up the series for good in a couple months.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e.webp 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-300x225.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-768x576.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-728x546.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-480x360.webp 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-320x240.webp 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown appears to be in distress here.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Aside from these scheduling questions, there&#8217;s another reason to believe that Sister Wives may soon be canceled. And that is this:</p>



<p>There are no more sister wives!</p>



<p>Christine Brown left Kody in November 2021. Janelle Brown did the same a few months later. In early 2023, Meri <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">Brown and Kody terminated their marriage</a>, stating back then:</p>



<p>“After more than a decade of working on our relationship in our own unique ways, we have made the decision to permanently terminate our marriage relationship.“</p>



<p>Kody is now married only to his sole legal spouse, Robyn, and has said he has no plans to return to a polygamous lifestyle.</p>



<p>With the family&#8217;s patriarch therefore committed to a monogamous relationship, and with Christine having moved on to a new husband (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley">David Woolley</a>), it&#8217;s very safe to ask what sort of storylines the show could even feature moving forward.</p>

<p>Relatedly, it&#8217;s easy to imagine a handful of Sister Wives spinoffs.</p>



<p>Robyn trying to deal with Kody on her own? We&#8217;d tune in.</p>



<p>Christine and David as newlyweds, navigating their new lives and taking full advantage of a universe that does NOT include a narcissist such as Kody Brown? We&#8217;d watch.</p>



<p>Janelle or Meri out and above, maybe looking to date, definitely expanding their world views, making the most of lives that are no longer controlling by a certain spiritual spouse? We&#8217;d be there.</p>



<p><em>So, you tell us, Sister Wives fans: Do you even want the network to air a Season 20? Or has the show in its current form run its course and you&#8217;re ready for something fresh?</em></p>
