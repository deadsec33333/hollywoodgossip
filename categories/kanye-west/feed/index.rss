<p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-says-he-never-wanted-kids-with-kim-kardashian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West&#8217;s disgusting social media rants</a> have shocked fans and horrified the rapper&#8217;s few remaining friends.</p>



<p>In tirades posted to X (formerly Twitter), West has declared himself a Nazi and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, of being a sex trafficker</a>.</p>



<p>There was a time when it was hard to imagine how Kanye could possibly sink any lower.</p>



<p>But he may have done just that with his latest tantrum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-makes-crude-comments-about-threesome-between-taylor-swift-justin-bieber-harry-styles">Kanye makes crude comments about threesome between Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Harry Styles</h2>



<p>In a rant that began late Wednesday night and continued into Thursday afternoon, Kanye made crass remarks about a number of celebrities, chief among them, Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll show you an example of racism. Justin Bieber and Harry Styles f&#8211;ked Taylor Swift from both sides and didn’t call me,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/kanyewest/status/1910211139285455084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he tweeted</a> at one point, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;ON EVEYTHIIING THIS TWEET IS ONE THOUSAND PERCENT TRUE.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1024x683.jpg" alt='Taylor Swift performs on stage during the "Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour" at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024 in London, England.' class="wp-image-523170" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift performs on stage during the &#8220;Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour&#8221; at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kate Green/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kanye went on to fantasize about shocking Taylor by revealing such information.</p>



<p>&#8220;I KNOW TAYLOR LIKE HOW THE F&#8211;K HE KNOW THAT,&#8221; he wrote, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;IM MAD I HAVENT F&#8211;KED TAYLOR SWIFT … YET.&#8221;</p>



<p>The remarks are particularly horrifying when taken as the latest evidence of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/travis-kelces-dad-slams-kanye-west-over-taylor-swift-based-song-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s years-long obsession with Taylor</a>, which was first displayed when he infamously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="706" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-90713084-1024x706.jpg" alt='Kanye West umps onstage after Taylor Swift won the "Best Female Video" award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

<p>Obviously, the whole situation is disgusting, but Kanye being Kanye, he was just getting warmed up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-makes-nauseating-comments-about-kim">Kanye makes nauseating comments about Kim </h2>



<p>From there, Kanye moved on to one of his favorite topics &#8212; the Kim Kardashian sex tape. Sure, the footage came out back in 2007, and Kim is the mother of Kanye&#8217;s four kids, but that won&#8217;t stop him from being gross about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Told Ray J we need to hit Kim from both sides for that Superstar part two,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/nojumper/status/1910354728489197590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye also admitted to sexually assaulting unsuspecting women while greeting them.</p>



<p>&#8220;I used to do this hug where I press my c-ck against the girls leg and place my hands right where my pinky can touch the top of their a-s like right under the small of their back,&#8221; he wrote.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-681x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival - Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-523166" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival &#8211; Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images for Fast Company)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As he often does these days, West also praised Hitler repeatedly throughout his tirade. At one point, he tweeted a photo of the infamous dictator along with a goat emoji.</p>



<p>This prompted Kanye&#8217;s long-suffering wife Bianca Censori to speak out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me be clear, Hitler was a genocidal murderer who should never be celebrated. Praising him is a direct insult to the millions who suffered especially the Jewish people,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Bianca_censor/status/1910319029824483500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she wrote</a>, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;@kanyewest antisemitic rhetoric is not only disturbing, it stands against everything I believe in. As long as he keeps repeating this dangerous narrative, I’ll keep speaking out—I want no part in it, &amp; never will.&#8221;</p>



<p>There have been reports that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bianca-censori-stays-with-kanye-west-out-of-fear-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca has separated from Kanye</a> and initiated divorce proceedings, but those remain unconfirmed.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it seems she&#8217;s finally grown tired of his crap.</p>

<p>Kanye West is in the midst of yet another meltdown. </p>



<p>And it seems that his second wife, Bianca Censori, has finally grown tired of his antics.</p>



<p>Even though his life is in shambles, Kanye has somehow found time to release a new album (which, of course, has songs titled &#8220;Cosby,&#8221; &#8220;Free Diddy,&#8221; and &#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221;).</p>



<p>In the lyrics, he opens up about his marriage and seems to confirm the rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bianca-censori-dumped-kanye-west-because-of-pro-nazi-remarks-insiders-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca finally dumped him</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-reveals-that-bianca-censori-tried-to-have-him-committed">Kanye West reveals that Bianca Censori tried to have him committed</h2>



<p>The news that Bianca wants to end her marriage didn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise.</p>



<p>After all, Kanye basically left her with no choice.</p>



<p>But it seems that prior to moving out, the Australian architect did her best to try and convince Kanye to seek psychiatric help.</p>



<p>“My baby she ran away / But first she tried to get me committed / Not going to the hospital ’cause I am not sick I just do not get it,” West raps on a song titled “WW3.&#8221;</p>

<p>“She’s having a panic attack and she is not liking the way that I tweeted / Until Bianca’s back I stay up all night I’m not going to sleep / I really don’t know where she’s at.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the track, Kanye lashes out at Bianca&#8217;s family, claiming they “want me locked up.”</p>



<p>“They want me to go on retreat / They want me to run and meet,” he raps.</p>



<p>“I guess we the new Cassie and Diddy / I’m making this song for Bianca / I’m feeling the spirit of Donda.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those lines refer both to the violently abusive relationship between <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/cassie-breaks-admits-shes-still-recovering-after-diddy-abuse-domestic-violence-broke-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy and Cassie Ventura</a> and his late mother, Donda West, whom Ye seems to believe would approve of his recent behavior.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-rough-patch-after-another">One rough patch after another</h2>



<p>Rumors of trouble in Kanye and Bianca&#8217;s marriage began back in February, when she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-bianca-censori-headed-for-divorce-in-wake-of-nude-grammys-stunt-pro-nazi-meltdown-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attended the Grammys in a see-through dress that West had designed</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye then took to social media to assure critics that he has &#8220;dominion&#8221; over his wife, and she does as he commands.</p>



<p>Bianca reportedly moved out after that chain of events, but it seems that she later reconciled with her controversial husband.</p>

<p>A source told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/03/celebrity-news/kanye-west-reveals-wife-bianca-censori-had-panic-attack-left-him-over-disturbing-rants-in-new-song-she-ran-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that Bianca wanted to leave Kanye for good, but she eventually came back to him out of fear.</p>



<p>“Kanye controls so many aspects of her life,” said the insider.</p>



<p>It seems that she&#8217;s now joined the rest of the world in being completely done with Kanye&#8217;s BS.</p>



<p>Perhaps Kanye will learn a valuable lesson about not publicly berating his wife and forcing her to parade around naked. But probably not.</p>

<p>Kanye West is running his mouth again.</p>



<p>And as usual, the unhinged rapper is burning every bridge in sight and doing his best to destroy his family.</p>



<p>Yes, once again, Kanye has done on the attack against his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.</p>



<p>And once again, the insults he&#8217;s directed at the mother of his children are shockingly brutal.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-31-at-10.32.49%E2%80%AFAM-1024x604.png" alt="Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in happier days." class="wp-image-522477"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in happier days.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (E!)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye accused Kim of sex trafficking</a>.</p>



<p>And over the weekend, he gave a long, bizarre interview with DJ Akademiks in which he took more shots at his ex.</p>



<p>At one point in the conversation, Ye donned a black Ku Klux Klan robe and calmly revealed that he never wanted to have kids with Kim.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-bashes-kim-kardashian-in-shocking-fashion">Kanye West bashes Kim Kardashian in shocking fashion</h2>



<p>“When you speak about Kim, people might be like, ‘Well, you picked her. You put yourself in that,'&#8221; Akademiks said, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/31/parents/kanye-west-says-he-didnt-want-to-have-kids-with-kim-kardashian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>

<p>“Absolutely, I did. That was my fault. No, that was my fault,&#8221; Ye replied.</p>



<p>“I didn’t want to have children with this person after the first two months of being with them, but that wasn’t God’s plan.”</p>



<p>Kanye didn&#8217;t go into detail or reveal <em>why</em> he changed his mind and decided to have four kids with Kim.</p>



<p>The youngest two were born via surrogate, so he can hardly claim that their pregnancies were accidental.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-continues-to-publicly-implode">Kanye continues to publicly implode</h2>

<p>As for the older kids, they&#8217;re 11 and 7 now &#8212; in other words, old enough to comprehend the insanity of this situation.</p>



<p>Kanye&#8217;s current meltdown has, sadly, affected his kids on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>Insiders say Kim was recently forced to cancel a visit between Kanye and eldest daughter North after learning that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/andrew-tate-accuser-claims-he-recorded-podcast-with-kanye-west-before-assault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tristan and Andrew Tate would also be present</a>.</p>



<p>The Tates are currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kanye chose a side in the ongoing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake feud</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;One thing is, Drake is a million times better than Kendrick and a million times more important,&#8221; he said of the rappers. </p>



<p>&#8220;What Future has done, [Young] Thug, Drake, culturally. That s&#8211;t last year, I could barely sit through that s&#8211;t. That s&#8211;t was insane, bro,&#8221; Kanye continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had Lucian Grainge, Universal, Drake lawsuit s&#8211;t written all over it. At the end of the day, all this s&#8211;t I&#8217;m saying – Jim Jones, Kendrick, all these celebrities – the funny thing is we&#8217;re all in the same boat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kanye also compared Drake to imprisoned mogul Diddy, but in Ye&#8217;s world, that&#8217;s a compliment.</p>



<p>Needless to say, he&#8217;s dug himself a very deep hole this time.</p>

<p>Bri Stern is the former girlfriend of Andrew Tate who says she was recently assaulted by the controversial media figure.</p>



<p>According to Stern, Tate punched and choked her during sex, leaving her with severe injuries.</p>



<p>She says the attack took place earlier this month in Los Angeles, the same night that Tate hung out with one of his famous friends &#8212; Kanye West.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andrew-and-tristan-tate-are-currently-awaiting-trial">Andrew and Tristan Tate are currently awaiting trial</h2>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/andrew-tate-alleged-rapist-human-trafficker-permitted-to-return-to-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew and brother Tristan Tate were recently allowed back into the US</a>, despite the fact that they&#8217;re currently awaiting trial in Romania.</p>



<p>Both Tates are charged with sex trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.</p>



<p>They recently returned to Romania under orders to present themselves at a police station. But the brothers certainly created a ton of chaos during their short time in America.</p>

<p>After landing in Florida and learning that the state planned to launch its own investigation into their alleged crimes, the Tates departed for Las Vegas.</p>



<p>At one point, they made a day trip to Los Angeles, where <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they met up with Kanye</a>, who was having a scandalous week of his own.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andrew-tate-and-kanye-west-cross-paths-amid-mutual-meltdowns">Andrew Tate and Kanye West cross paths amid mutual meltdowns</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;re likely aware, Kanye spent much of this month spewing hateful rhetoric and burning bridges on social media.</p>



<p>At one point, he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kim-kardashian-to-kanye-west-youre-about-to-lose-custody-of-your-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused ex-wife Kim Kardashian of sex trafficking</a>, which is the height of irony, as he was apparently podcasting with accused sex trafficker Andrew Tate at the time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="742" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-742x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-522339" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-742x1024.jpg 742w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-217x300.jpg 217w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-768x1060.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-1484x2048.jpg 1484w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-696x960.jpg 696w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-783x1080.jpg 783w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-870x1200.jpg 870w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-5-scaled.jpg 1856w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, we knew that West and Tate spent time together recently. But news of their podcasting collab was just revealed in Stern&#8217;s criminal complaint.</p>



<p>In documents obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/27/kanye-west-andrew-tate-podcast/">TMZ</a>, Stern claims that West and Tate recorded an episode together. There are no details yet as to when it might be released, but you can be certain that it&#8217;ll receive a lot of attention when it drops.</p>



<p>An attorney for Tate, Joseph McBride, previously hinted at the podcast in a post on X, saying:</p>



<p>&#8220;Last night, I sat on a couch and watched Andrew, Tristan, and @kanyewest talk for hours about the suffering and betrayals they&#8217;ve endured for achieving greatness on their own terms.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stern&#8217;s account aligns with previous accounts claiming that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-could-lose-custody-of-kids-dr-phil-warns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim canceled a planned visit between Kanye and daughter North</a> when she learned that the Tates would also be in attendance at West&#8217;s recording studio.</p>



<p>Sounds like she made the right call. We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>There was a time when Kanye West&#8217;s tirades were more funny than disturbing.</p>



<p>Those days are long gone, of course, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-jay-z-is-gonna-kill-me-for-insulting-his-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s current meltdown</a> is revealing the severity of his bigotry and mental illness.</p>



<p>The situation has certainly complicated the life of anyone with ties to Kanye, especially his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, who has four kids with the disgraced rapper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-s-behavior-raises-custody-questions">Kanye&#8217;s behavior raises custody questions</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Kim and Kanye have clashed publicly about his behavior toward their children, particularly his decision to collaborate with daughter North on a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">song featuring vocals from accused sex offender Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye not only shared screenshots of angry text messages he received from Kim, he also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused the entire Kardashian family of sex trafficking</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Dr. Phil has become the latest celebrity to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bethenny-frankel-to-kim-kardashian-you-need-to-protect-your-children-from-kanye-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caution Kim that she needs to take action</a> before it&#8217;s too late.</p>



<p>Otherwise, Phil warns, Kim&#8217;s kids could wind up in foster care.</p>

<p>“If you need an emergency intervention, then you get an emergency intervention,” he said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOr_Xdtzo8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>’s “2 Angry Men” podcast Wednesday. “What we don’t want is for these children to wind up in foster care because that system is broken.”</p>



<p>Phil explained that in a case this extreme, Kim and Kanye&#8217;s billions of dollars might not be enough to protect their family against government intervention.</p>



<p>“If you think, ‘Well, with this kind of money, they’re not gonna wind up in foster care,’ well, that’s wrong,” he said.</p>



<p>“If the [Department of Children and Families] gets involved and thinks one parent isn’t reacting while the other is unstable, they will take them,” the TV personality and self-help guru shared.</p>

<p>“Now, they’re likely to place them with family members rather than strangers, but you don’t want these children left hanging out to dry.”</p>

<p>Obviously, Kim has some very difficult decisions to make.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s very wary of what might happen if she antagonizes Kanye in his current state.</p>

<p>But at the same time, if she does nothing, his actions and comments could prompt an investigation.</p>



<p>Ideally, someone who&#8217;s currently close to Kanye would intervene, take his phone away, and encourage him to check into a treatment facility.</p>



<p>But it seems that he&#8217;s pushed just about everyone away, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bianca-censori-stays-with-kanye-west-out-of-fear-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including his wife, Bianca Censori</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye has been behaving erratically for years now, but these days the stakes are higher than ever. And his kids are old enough to understand how frightening the situation is.</p>

<p>When Kanye West&#8217;s latest meltdown kicked into high gear, there was talk about what sort of impact his bigoted tirades would have upon his marriage.</p>



<p>At one point, there were rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-bianca-censori-headed-for-divorce-in-wake-of-nude-grammys-stunt-pro-nazi-meltdown-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca Censori had finally left Kanye.</a> Alas, those turned out to be wishful thinking.</p>



<p>It now looks as though Bianca and Kanye are still together. But one insider says she&#8217;s desperately seeking a way out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bianca-censori-is-afraid-of-kanye-west-source-claims">Bianca Censori is afraid of Kanye West, source claims </h2>



<p>A source close to the situation tells <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/24/celebrity-news/bianca-censori-frightened-of-kanye-west-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that Bianca is &#8220;frightened&#8221; of West and would leave him if she felt safe doing so.</p>



<p>“I think Bianca wants to break up, but it’s not easy. Kanye controls so many aspects of her life,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p>At the moment, Kanye is in Japan, and Bianca has stayed behind in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>The distance between them could provide her with an opportunity for escape. But it seems that Kanye has been keeping a close eye on his wife from afar.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-allegedly-keeps-bianca-under-close-surveillance">Kanye allegedly keeps Bianca under close surveillance</h2>



<p>It seems that Bianca recently moved from the Chateau Marmont to a less high-profile hotel. And it wasn&#8217;t long before the change in location was reported to Kanye.</p>



<p>“Bianca went to another hotel and someone narced it out,” the source said. “He sent the security guards over and wouldn’t leave her alone … this was about a week ago and now he’s left town.</p>



<p>The insider went on to allege that Kanye is &#8220;obsessed with&#8221; Bianca and watches her every move.</p>

<p>“She’s living under this aggressive situation,” the source added. “She’s gotta run, but he’s obsessed with her. It’s been hard for her to get [out on her own] and move around.”</p>

<p>The weeks that followed saw Kanye launch some of the most shocking social media tirades of his career.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-682x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival - Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-522041" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140733-3-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival &#8211; Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images for Fast Company)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In addition to his usual bigotry, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">West went on the attack against his first wife, Kim Kardashian</a>, at one point accusing her of sex trafficking.</p>



<p>Naturally, Kanye did not present any evidence of these claims. In fact, he accused Kim of sex crimes while <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defending Diddy</a>, who is currently behind bars awaiting trial for rape and sex trafficking.</p>



<p>Claims that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-bianca-censori-headed-for-divorce-in-wake-of-nude-grammys-stunt-pro-nazi-meltdown-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca had dumped Kanye</a> in response to his latest meltdown seemed reasonable.</p>



<p>After all, the man was selling swastika t-shirts and proudly declaring himself a Nazi.</p>



<p>But it looks as though Bianca and Kanye are still an item for the time being. We&#8217;ll continue to monitor the situation and provide you with updates as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Kanye West has been making so many headlines lately that it&#8217;s hard to keep up with all of his repugnant behavior.</p>



<p>In addition to the tweets in which he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-jay-z-is-gonna-kill-me-for-insulting-his-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hurls outrageous slurs at his friends&#8217; children</a>, Kanye has been collaborating with accused criminals and tossing out allegations that could result in real-world harm.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, he hit a new low when he accused his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, of being a sex trafficker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kim Kardashian is a sex trafficker.&#8221; That allegation appears to be a response to the fact that Kim and Kanye&#8217;s eldest daughter North recently appeared in a music video for singer FKA Twigs.</p>



<p>Kanye&#8217;s irritation with the Twigs video is ironic for a number of reasons:</p>

<p>For one thing, he recently used vocals from North on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a song featuring imprisoned accused sex trafficker Diddy</a>, which seems like a far more inappropriate project for an 11-year-old.</p>



<p>On top of that, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/19/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-calls-her-sex-trafficker-tate-brothers-north-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reports that Kim was recently forced to pull the plug on a planned father-daughter visit when she learned that Kanye had also invited Andrew and Tristan Tate to his home.</p>



<p>Andrew Tate is awaiting trial on rape charges, and both brothers stand accused of &#8220;creating a criminal organization&#8221; in Romania.</p>



<p>Despite the charges, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/andrew-tate-alleged-rapist-human-trafficker-permitted-to-return-to-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Tates were recently permitted to return to the US</a>. They fled Florida last month after learning that state authorities had launched their own investigation.</p>

<p>The Tate brothers are reportedly residing in Las Vegas at the moment. It&#8217;s unclear where they planned to meet up with Kanye or if the meeting wound up taking place.</p>



<p>TMZ&#8217;s sources note that there&#8217;s an additional layer of irony to Kanye&#8217;s allegations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insiders-point-to-kanye-s-recent-behavior-as-indication-of-mental-illness">Insiders point to Kanye&#8217;s recent behavior as indication of mental illness</h2>



<p>It was only a few weeks ago that Kanye showed up to the Grammys with a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-bianca-censori-headed-for-divorce-in-wake-of-nude-grammys-stunt-pro-nazi-meltdown-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nude Bianca Censori </a>on his arm. </p>



<p>The sources say it&#8217;s more than a little ironic that a man who enjoys parading his naked wife in front of an audience of millions is now accusing Kim Kardashian of sex trafficking.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677460319-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends the Kering Caring For Women Dinner at The Pool on September 12, 2023 in New York City.

<p>Even Kanye&#8217;s remaining supporters are encouraging him to either present some evidence or stop accusing people of crimes as serious as sex trafficking.</p>



<p>Of course, at this point, the rapper seems to be entirely detached from reality, so he&#8217;ll likely continue tweeting whatever pops into his head regardless of whether there are any facts to support his claims.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Kim and company are forced to look and hope that the damage from Kanye&#8217;s latest meltdown will be minimal.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Folks, we regret to inform you that Kanye West is very much back on his BS.</p>



<p>And this time, he seems determined to burn the few remaining bridges that remain in his life.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kim-kardashian-to-kanye-west-youre-about-to-lose-custody-of-your-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye went on the attack against Kim Kardashian</a>, referring to his ex-wife as an &#8220;old white lady&#8221; who&#8217;s trying to manipulate his children.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Kanye broadened his focus, launching <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacks against several rappers, including Drake and Kendrick Lamar</a>. But the most surprising insults were the ones West directed at his former friend Jay Z.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="742" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299756-2-742x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-hurls-disgusting-slurs-at-jay-z-amp-beyonce-s-children">Kanye West hurls disgusting slurs at Jay Z &amp; Beyonce&#8217;s children</h2>



<p>At one point in yesterday&#8217;s tirade, <a href="https://x.com/headnavy/status/1902146748283330863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye tweeted</a> that Jay and Beyonce&#8217;s &#8220;younger kids&#8221; are &#8220;r&#8211;arded.&#8221;</p>



<p>He later deleted the tweet, but he explained that he did not do so out of kindness or decency.</p>



<p>“I need everyone to know that I took the post about Jay Z and Beyoncé’s family down … because there was a possibility of my Twitter being cancelled [sic],&#8221; West wrote.</p>



<p>For a while, it looked like that would be the end of this latest meltdown.</p>



<p>But today, Ye was back at it, joking (we think) that he expects to be murdered by Jay as a result of his gross digs at his former friend&#8217;s children:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-says-he-expects-to-be-killed-by-jay-z">Kanye says he expects to be killed by Jay Z</h2>



<p>&#8220;I KNOW JAY Z IS DRIVING AROUND LIKE DAMN I HAVE TO KILL KANYE,&#8221; he tweeted in his usual all-caps style, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;I KNOW ITS GONNA HURT JAY Z TO KILL ME BUT SOMEBODYS GOTTA DO IT &#8230; PLUS I DONT WANT THE JEWS GETTING CREDIT FOR MY MURDER.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, Kanye figured out a way to work <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his infamous anti-semitism</a> into this latest rant. </p>



<p>As for his own kids, Kanye has continued to involve them in his drama against the wishes of their mother.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-679x1024.jpg" alt="Rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West attend the 2012 BET Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on July 1, 2012 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-521680" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-679x1024.jpg 679w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-768x1158.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-1358x2048.jpg 1358w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-636x960.jpg 636w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-716x1080.jpg 716w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-796x1200.jpg 796w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-147543284-scaled.jpg 1697w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West attend the 2012 BET Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on July 1, 2012 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images For BET)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier this week, the rapper released a song featuring vocals from his daughter North, as well as from imprisoned mogul Diddy.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://x.com/EastKanyeYE/status/1902384616398545237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">West released a short film and new album art</a>, both of which feature his son Saint.</p>



<p>&#8220;I PUT MY SON ON THE BULLY ALBUM COVER TO BUILD OUR RELATIONSHIP,&#8221; he tweeted.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a nice thought. But if Kanye really wants a closer relationship with his son, he might want to start by respecting the kid&#8217;s mother and cutting back on the Nazi rhetoric.</p>



<p>As for Jay Z and Beyonce, they have yet to comment on Kanye&#8217;s latest tirade, but you can be certain that they&#8217;re not thrilled about it.</p>



<p>Jay was an instrumental figure in the early days of Kanye&#8217;s career, and he&#8217;s probably not thrilled by his former protege&#8217;s way of paying him back.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Kanye West is having another meltdown on social media.</p>



<p>And this time, he seems determined to alienate his few remaining friends and supporters.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye went on the attack against Kim Kardashian </a>and her family.</p>

<p>That same day, he released a song on which he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bethenny-frankel-to-kim-kardashian-you-need-to-protect-your-children-from-kanye-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with accused sex trafficker Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kim was upset to learn that vocals from her 11-year-old daughter were also featured on the track.</p>



<p>Kanye responded by lashing out at his ex-wife and publicly sharing screenshots of her text messages.</p>



<p>Today, Ye expanded his focus. </p>



<p>He continued lashing out at Kim (at one point, he tweeted, &#8220;I don’t give a f&#8211;k about that old white lady other than her always pulling bulls&#8211;t with my black children,&#8221;) but he also took shots at several fellow rappers, including Tyler, the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yet-another-tirade-from-kanye">Yet another tirade from Kanye</h2>



<p>He was particularly harsh in his criticism toward Drake, whom he repeatedly referred to using homophobic slurs.</p>



<p>&#8220;I DON’T PERSONALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH KENDRICK (I PROBABLY WILL NOW) BUT HE WAS A PAWN TO TAKE DOWN F&#8211;GOT(AKA DRAKE) BECAUSE THESE RECORD LABELS DONT WANT BIG ARTIST BECAUSE THE SMALLER ARTIST ARE EASIER TO CONTROL AND REPLACE,&#8221; Kanye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK WAS THE INDUSTRY PUPPET THEN THEY WAS DONE WITH HIM,&#8221; he added, in his usual all-caps style.</p>



<p>Kanye went on to say that he hates to give any credit to Drake (whom he continued to refer to with homophobic) before praising a lyric from one of his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick diss tracks</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-directs-his-wrath-toward-kendrick-lamar-defends-diddy">Kanye directs his wrath toward Kendrick Lamar, defends Diddy</h2>



<p>As evidenced by the &#8220;industry puppet&#8221; line, Kanye is also no fan of Kendrick&#8217;s, and he made the extent of his feelings clear today:</p>



<p>&#8220;HATE TO GIVE THIS F&#8211;GOT CREDIT BUT FAVORITE LINE OF THE BATTLE LAST YEAR IS WHEN THE F&#8211;GGOT SAID &#8216;YOU RAP LIKE YOU TRYNA FREE THE SLAVES&#8217; HE DOES,&#8221; Ye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;NOOOOBODY HAS EVER LISTENED TO KENDRICK OR KNOWS ANY OF HIS SONGS,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK SOUND LIKE A RAPIST.&#8221; He offered no additional context for that seemingly unfounded claim.</p>



<p>All of this came on the heels of a bizarre Instagram post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHUV88fyq8E/?img_index=1">The Shade Room</a>, in which Kanye is seen having a lengthy conversation with Diddy, who apparently called him from prison.</p>

<p>Kanye has been defending the disgraced mogul for weeks. Today he wrote that he can&#8217;t understand why so many people are &#8220;MAD AT PUFF [Diddy],&#8221; as everyone &#8220;KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HIT A GIRL.&#8221;</p>



<p>West went on to compare himself to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams, who is currently under a conservatorship</a>. He then stated that he expects to be placed under a 5150 psychiatric hold because of his tweets.</p>



<p>Kenye concluded one of the day&#8217;s many tirades with:</p>



<p>&#8220;I TWEET EVERYTHING I THINK OF.&#8221;</p>



<p>We certainly won&#8217;t argue with him there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Kim Kardashian is considering the nuclear option when it comes to her children.</p>



<p>As previously discussed and detailed, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/">Kanye West released a new track</a> over the weekend titled &#8220;Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The artist&#8217;s daughter, North, has a cameo on this song &#8212; despite Kardashian having strongly voiced her disapproval of North being used in such fashion.</p>



<p>And despite the fact that the former couple&#8217;s divorce agreement says both sides must have an equal say when it comes to making decisions such as this in regard to their children.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, both Kim and Kanye attended a mediation session on Friday with their respective lawyers where they agreed that North would <em><strong>not</strong></em> appear on any version of this song if it were released.</p>



<p>West then went ahead and immediately violated this agreement.</p>



<p>Just before uploading the track on Saturday, the rapper even put up screenshots of alleged text conversations he claims to have had with Kardashian… as the exes went back and forth regarding the trademark of North’s name.</p>



<p>At one point in this exchange, West tells Kardashian “I’m never speaking with you again,” to which Kim replies:</p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!”</p>

<p>West also threatened &#8220;war&#8221; against is ex and said &#8220;neither of us will recover from the public fallout&#8221; if he takes that route, adding: &#8220;You’re going to have to kill me.”</p>



<p>One could argue, of course, that Kanye won&#8217;t recover from many of his recent actions outside of this spat&#8230; considering he&#8217;s just and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">out and proud Nazi at this point</a>.</p>



<p>But anyway.</p>



<p>Back to what Kim is now thinking about in the wake of this legal dispute&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="762" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-762x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-503069" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-762x1024.jpg 762w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-223x300.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-768x1031.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-1525x2048.jpg 1525w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-715x960.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-804x1080.jpg 804w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-894x1200.jpg 894w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-scaled.jpg 1906w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend the WSJ Magazine 2019 Innovator Awards at MOMA on November 6, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reality star is “seriously considering going to court to ask a judge to strip [Kanye] of joint legal custody,” writes TMZ.</p>



<p>To be clear, Kardashian already has <em>physical</em> custody of her children. She has never prevented them from seeing their dad, either.</p>



<p>However, Kim may make this extra move to ensure the safety of her kids and to disassociate them as much as possible from a man who certainly appears to be VERY far off his rocker.</p>



<p>Aside from North, Kim and Kanye share three other kids: Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 5.</p>

<p>West, for his part, has only responded to this latest feud by ranting like a mad man on social media.</p>



<p>“I DONT WANT TO JUST ‘SEE’ MY KIDS. I NEED TO RAISE THEM. I NEED TO HAVE SAY SO OF WEAR [sic] THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND WHOSE HOUSES THEY SLEEP OVER WEATHER [sic] MY DAUGHTERS WEAR LIPSTICK AND PERFUME,” he wrote via X on Saturday, March 15. </p>



<p>“ALL THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ME BY THE KARDASHIAN MOB, HULU AND DISNEY AND THE BIGGER AGENDA TO USE THE SELECTIVELY BRED BLACK CHILDREN TO BE PLATFORMS TO INFLUENCE BLACK PEOPLE.”</p>



<p>And when it comes to issues such as his daughter appearing on a rap song?</p>



<p>&#8220;THE MAN MAKES THE FINAL DECISION, West added.</p>



<p>The guy is such a sweetheart, isn&#8217;t he?</p>
