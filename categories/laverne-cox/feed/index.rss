<p>Laverne Cox has come out with a very important series at a very important time.</p>



<p><em>Clean Slate</em>, which premiered on Amazon Prime Video on February 6, stars the <em>Orange Is The New Black</em> alum alongside George Wallace.</p>



<p>Laverne reached deep into her own childhood pain to tell this humorous, uplifting story.</p>



<p>But she hopes that this will have a healing effect upon viewers. Especially now, at a time when her story is so painfully relevant.</p>

It is a very personal story for the actress.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Amazon Prime Video)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laverne-cox-and-george-wallace-star-in-clean-slate-on-prime">Laverne Cox and George Wallace star in &#8216;Clean Slate&#8217; on Prime</h2>



<p><em>Clean Slate</em> is a new series of Prime Video. The show stars Laverne Cox as Desiree, the estranged adult daughter of Harry Slate, portrayed by George Wallace.</p>



<p>Desiree returns to her small Alabama hometown where Harry lives and owns a car wash. Funding for her art gallery in New York has fallen through, and her visit home turns into an extended stay.</p>



<p>The catch is that she isn&#8217;t just playing catch-up on life events. She is a transgender woman, and until the moment of their reconnection, her father has only known her as his &#8220;son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking to <em><a href="https://people.com/why-laverne-cox-wanted-to-retraumatize-herself-childhood-memories-clean-slate-exclusive-8787487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> alongside the premiere, Laverne expressed how using very real stories of what it means to be trans in our deeply transphobic society also means being able to &#8220;explore healing&#8221; and humor on the show.</p>



<p>Laverne explained how she took her own &#8220;contentious, conflicted relationship with home&#8221; and the &#8220;trauma of my childhood.&#8221; She then made them &#8220;quite hilarious for the show.&#8221;</p>



<p>Traditionally, real-life trauma is a major source of inspiration for comedy. That&#8217;s as true for<em> Clean Slate</em> as it is for the bulk of stand-up comedy. Ultimately, Laverne hopes that this is &#8220;healing for the audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though revisiting some aspects of her childhood was &#8220;triggering, almost every day,&#8221; Laverne Cox knows that it&#8217;s for a good cause. And not only in service of the show itself.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/06/entertainment/laverne-cox-trans-clean-slate-wrong-1-percent/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a> reported on her statements elsewhere about what it means to make a series like <em>Clean Slate</em> at a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the worst political figures</a> on the planet are using the LGBTQ+ community &#8212; and particularly the trans community &#8212; as a scapegoat and a malicious rallying cry.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">“In terms of the trans aspect of it, we’re experiencing the most intense backlash against trans visibility that I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Laverne acknowledged. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="George Wallace Shares His Modern Life Observations, Talks Clean Slate with Laverne Cox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bf95CPGyNQ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“You know, the Republican Party spent $215 million on anti-trans ads in this last election,&#8221; Laverne Cox cited. &#8220;And if you watched, you would think the last election was about trans people and immigrants.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Executive orders limiting our rights, 26 states banned gender affirming care for young people, banning us from the military, from bathrooms,&#8221; she listed grimly. &#8220;There’s this whole anti-trans thing, and we’re less than 1% of the population.&#8221;</p>



<p>Referring to a recent response to the bigoted anti-trans backlash, Laverne noted: “Someone in my comment section said, ‘They’re worried about the wrong 1%.’” (The right 1% being billionaires, some of whom are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5289315/trump-week-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actively dismantling the US government</a> as we speak)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-re-worried-about-the-wrong-1">&#8216;They&#8217;re worried about the wrong 1%&#8217;</h2>



<p>“In 2025, as federal bans come down attacking trans people, what I love about this show and what I love about being an artist is that artists can be arbiters of empathy,” Laverne expressed. She pointed out that empathy “can foster humanity.”</p>



<p>She acknowledged: “Trans people have been so deeply dehumanized over the past several years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Laverne then affirmed: &#8220;Art, getting to know trans people as people, is a way to re-humanize.”</p>

<p>Laverne Cox shared a photo on her Instagram account of her and Caitlyn Jenner hanging out at an advanced screening yesterday of the latter&rsquo;s upcoming E! reality series, <a href="/videos/i-am-cait-trailer/">I Am Cait</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Orange is the New Black actress included the following caption along with the above picture online:</p>
<p>&quot;@caitlynjenner and I finally met in person at a special private advance screening of #IAmCait. #TransIsBeautiful #girlslikeus.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the second time in a week that Cox has expressed admiration and support for Jenner.</p>
<p>Like so many other celebrities in Hollywood, Cox gave Jenner a shout-out last Wednesday night, following <a href="/2015/07/caitlyn-jenner-espys-speech-accept-people-for-who-they-are/">Caitlyn&#8217;s inspiring ESPYs&nbsp;speech</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Love this. Go Caitlyn. #TransIsBeautiful,&quot; Cox wrote in response to Jenner&#8217;s&nbsp;moving words at the ceremony.</p>
<p>Here is a look, meanwhile, at how <a href="/slideshows/caitlyn-jenner-espys-reaction-see-what-the-stars-said/">other stars received Caitlyn&#8217;s message</a>.</p>
<p>Cox previously praised Jenner in Entertainment Weekly&#8217;s LGBT issue a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Her authenticity, her vulnerability is beautiful. Her love of family is so beautiful,&quot; the actress said. &quot;Caitlyn is dynamic and has a sense of purpose and vision.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jenner&#8217;s docuseries, I Am Cait, premieres July 26 on E!.</p>

<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>&quot;You are fierce and fabulous!&quot; wrote Caitlyn. &quot;Your support means the world. Thank you for all you do for the community.&quot;</p>
<p>Cox has made several statements in support of&nbsp;Jenner, who came out as a woman last month by posing for Vanity Fair and who used Cox&#8217;s saying of &quot;<a href="/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-embraces-women-posts-inspiring-twit-pic/">#TransIsBeautiful</a>&quot; as a caption for a recent photo.</p>
<p>Following Jenner&#8217;s interview with Diane Sawyer on April 24, Cox commended Jenner&#8217;s courage, saying, &quot;It is always brave to stand in one&#8217;s truth.&quot;</p>
<p>From there, after&nbsp;<a href="/2015/06/bruce-jenner-as-a-woman-first-look/">Caitlyn made her debut</a> on Vanity Fair, Cox released a state that read in part:</p>
<p>&quot;I am so moved by all the love and support Caitlyn is receiving.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like a new day, indeed, when a trans person can present her authentic self to the world for the first time and be celebrated for it so universally.&quot;</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Laverne Cox has made history once again.</p>

<p>The actress, who will soon hit small screens all over the country again when <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/episodes/season-3/">Orange is the New Black Season 3</a> comes out on June 12, is featured in the latest issue of Allure.</p>
<p>And she&#8217;s totally naked.</p>

<p>Cox &#8211; who was photographed for this racy edition by Norman Jean Roy &#8211; admits she was hesitant to go all <a href="/stars/kim-kardashian.html">Kim Kardashian</a> on readers at first.</p>
<p>So, what convinced her it was a worthwhile endeavor?</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m a black transgender woman,&quot; she says. &quot;I felt this could be really powerful for the communities that I represent. Black women are not often told that we&#8217;re beautiful unless we align with certain standards.</p>
<p>&quot;Trans women certainly are not told we&#8217;re beautiful. Seeing a black transgender woman embracing and loving everything about herself might be inspiring to some other folks. There&#8217;s beauty in the things we think are imperfect. That sounds very clich&eacute;, but it&#8217;s true.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicole Beharie, Jordana Brewster, Sandrine Holt and Katheryn Winnick also don their birthday suits for this issue of Allure, which features (a clothed) Blake Lively on the cover.</p>
<p>In past years, this annual issue of Allure has featured Leslie Bibb, Colbie Caillat, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Eliza Dushku, Chelsea Handler, Taraji P. Henson and <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/2009/04/padma-lakshmi-nude-in-allure/">Padma Lakshmi nude</a>, among other beauties.</p>
<p>&quot;I honestly just want to make myself happy most, and if other people like it, then that&#8217;s great,&quot; Cox also tells Allure. &quot;If they don&#8217;t, then I&#8217;m still happy.&quot;</p>
