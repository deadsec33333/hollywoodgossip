<p>Kanye West is having another meltdown on social media.</p>



<p>And this time, he seems determined to alienate his few remaining friends and supporters.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye went on the attack against Kim Kardashian </a>and her family.</p>

<p>That same day, he released a song on which he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bethenny-frankel-to-kim-kardashian-you-need-to-protect-your-children-from-kanye-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with accused sex trafficker Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kim was upset to learn that vocals from her 11-year-old daughter were also featured on the track.</p>



<p>Kanye responded by lashing out at his ex-wife and publicly sharing screenshots of her text messages.</p>



<p>Today, Ye expanded his focus. </p>



<p>He continued lashing out at Kim (at one point, he tweeted, &#8220;I don’t give a f&#8211;k about that old white lady other than her always pulling bulls&#8211;t with my black children,&#8221;) but he also took shots at several fellow rappers, including Tyler, the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yet-another-tirade-from-kanye">Yet another tirade from Kanye</h2>



<p>He was particularly harsh in his criticism toward Drake, whom he repeatedly referred to using homophobic slurs.</p>



<p>&#8220;I DON’T PERSONALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH KENDRICK (I PROBABLY WILL NOW) BUT HE WAS A PAWN TO TAKE DOWN F&#8211;GOT(AKA DRAKE) BECAUSE THESE RECORD LABELS DONT WANT BIG ARTIST BECAUSE THE SMALLER ARTIST ARE EASIER TO CONTROL AND REPLACE,&#8221; Kanye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK WAS THE INDUSTRY PUPPET THEN THEY WAS DONE WITH HIM,&#8221; he added, in his usual all-caps style.</p>



<p>Kanye went on to say that he hates to give any credit to Drake (whom he continued to refer to with homophobic) before praising a lyric from one of his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick diss tracks</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-directs-his-wrath-toward-kendrick-lamar-defends-diddy">Kanye directs his wrath toward Kendrick Lamar, defends Diddy</h2>



<p>As evidenced by the &#8220;industry puppet&#8221; line, Kanye is also no fan of Kendrick&#8217;s, and he made the extent of his feelings clear today:</p>



<p>&#8220;HATE TO GIVE THIS F&#8211;GOT CREDIT BUT FAVORITE LINE OF THE BATTLE LAST YEAR IS WHEN THE F&#8211;GGOT SAID &#8216;YOU RAP LIKE YOU TRYNA FREE THE SLAVES&#8217; HE DOES,&#8221; Ye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;NOOOOBODY HAS EVER LISTENED TO KENDRICK OR KNOWS ANY OF HIS SONGS,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK SOUND LIKE A RAPIST.&#8221; He offered no additional context for that seemingly unfounded claim.</p>



<p>All of this came on the heels of a bizarre Instagram post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHUV88fyq8E/?img_index=1">The Shade Room</a>, in which Kanye is seen having a lengthy conversation with Diddy, who apparently called him from prison.</p>

<p>Kanye has been defending the disgraced mogul for weeks. Today he wrote that he can&#8217;t understand why so many people are &#8220;MAD AT PUFF [Diddy],&#8221; as everyone &#8220;KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HIT A GIRL.&#8221;</p>



<p>West went on to compare himself to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams, who is currently under a conservatorship</a>. He then stated that he expects to be placed under a 5150 psychiatric hold because of his tweets.</p>



<p>Kenye concluded one of the day&#8217;s many tirades with:</p>



<p>&#8220;I TWEET EVERYTHING I THINK OF.&#8221;</p>



<p>We certainly won&#8217;t argue with him there.</p>

<p>2024 was a year that Drake would probably like to forget. And thus far, 2025 is not looking much better for the Canadian hip hop legend.</p>



<p>Drake&#8217;s feud with Kendrick Lamar remains the music industry&#8217;s top story, thanks in part to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-kendrick-lamar-bad-blood-halftime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick&#8217;s Super Bowl halftime show</a>.</p>



<p>(Which came just one week after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick picked up five Grammys</a> for his Drake-targeted diss track &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221;)</p>



<p>The humiliation continued Sunday night, as<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Oscars host Conan O&#8217;Brien</a> mentioned the drama in a joke that went too far in the eyes of some viewers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conan-s-drake-joke-receives-a-mixed-reaction">Conan&#8217;s Drake joke receives a mixed reaction</h2>



<p>“We’re halfway through the show, which means it’s time for Kendrick Lamar to come out and call Drake a pedophile,” Conan quipped at the ceremony&#8217;s midway point. </p>



<p>After a brief pause and a round of shocked laughter, the late night host added, “Don’t worry, I’m lawyered up.”</p>



<p>The crowd at the Dolby Theater seemed mostly in favor of the joke. But on social media, the reaction was far more negative.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess pedophilia and molestation is now normalized and ok to joke about. Do y’all not see what is happening? If this was about anyone BUT Drake he would never be allowed at the Oscars again,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/hatingway2hard/status/1896389863752257626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote one</a> X (formerly Twitter) user.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diddy actually had victims, but let’s make a joke about Drake which were false accusations,&#8221; another <a href="https://x.com/keepitreal_4L/status/1896405810655490317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimed in</a>.</p>



<p>Podcaster Van Lathan <a href="https://x.com/VanLathan/status/1896386912174399930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote simply</a>, &#8220;This is wack.&#8221;</p>



<p>But as one user pointed out, Conan did not actually level any sort of allegations at Drake.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny to see people freaking out that Conan called Drake a pedophile when instead he just referenced the thing that happened that everyone hasn&#8217;t shut the f&#8211;k up about for months,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/josiahhughes/status/1896588834370113648">this person wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, the Drake-Kendrick back-and-forth has been going on for months, and while we may not be accustomed to hearing pedophilia jokes at the Oscars, it&#8217;s important to note that Conan was just referencing recent events in the world of pop culture, not taking any shots at Drake.</p>



<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a good chance that last night&#8217;s joke might wind up getting cited as evidence soon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/drake-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake is currently suing Universal Music Group</a> &#8212; which is <em>his</em> label as well as Kendrick&#8217;s &#8212; alleging that the company was complicit in pushing lies about his personal life (via Lamar&#8217;s music).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s too soon to say how that situation will play out. But one thing you can be sure of: The Drake vs. Kendrick feud is far from over.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-kendrick-lamar-bad-blood-halftime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar headlined the halftime show at Super Bowl LIX</a>.</p>



<p>And as expected, the performance has generated quite a bit of controversy.</p>



<p>Much of the discourse has to do with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick&#8217;s ongoing feud with rival rapper Drake</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-serena-williams-gets-involved-in-the-drake-v-kendrick-feud">Serena Williams Gets Involved in the Drake v Kendrick Feud</h2>



<p>In what was either a brilliant display of trolling or sad proof of unfathomable pettiness (depending on who you ask), <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drake-seems-to-shade-ex-serena-williams-ahead-of-her-super-bowl-appearance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick brought out Drake&#8217;s ex-girlfriend Serena Williams</a> to dance to the scathing diss track &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221;</p>



<p>K-Dot&#8217;s fans loved the shade of it all, but several prominent pundits &#8212; including sports broadcasting legend Stephen A. Smith &#8212; thought the move was beneath Serena.</p>



<p>“If I’m your husband, I’m thinking, ‘Why are you up there trolling him &#8212; trolling your ex?’” Stephen said during a recent episode of ESPN&#8217;s <em>First Take</em>. </p>



<p>“If I’m married, and my wife is going to troll her ex &#8212; go back to his ass. Because clearly you don’t belong with me. What you worried about him for &#8212; and you with me?”</p>

<p>After he was widely accused of misogyny, Smith defended his remarks with a lengthy post on X (formerly Twitter):</p>



<p>“Please go back and look at exactly what I said. I was talking overall from a man’s perspective &#8212; highlighting what most men would think,” <a href="https://x.com/stephenasmith/status/1889499265917133168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the post began</a>.</p>



<p>“I didn’t utter a single disrespectful word about Serena. No issues with folks getting upset of literal serious stuff one’s pissed about. This doesn’t qualify peeps. Come on. We were joking around on @FirstTake. Damn y’all! It’s not that serious.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drake-claps-back">Drake Claps Back</h2>



<p>Never one to shy away from an opportunity to be petty, Drake allegedly replied to Serena&#8217;s performance in his own &#8212; very shady &#8212; way.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/drake-responds-serena-williams-kendrick-145654321.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibe</a></em>, the Drake reacted using the Instagram account that&#8217;s widely believed to be his burner.</p>



<p>The account shared a photo with his arm around the neck of Serena&#8217;s longtime agent, Jill Smoller. The pic was taken at Wimbledon in 2015, and many have noted that it seems to have an ominous tone.</p>

<p>Many of the comments on the post came from followers who were critical of Drizzy&#8217;s (alleged) subtle shade.</p>



<p>&#8220;A grown man said your name on a global stage but you got a rebuttal for the woman who was dancing,&#8221; one commenter wrote.</p>



<p>“‘Drake is so unbothered.’ This dude was definitely crying after watching the highlights,” another added.</p>



<p>“Kendrick been dog walking this ni&#8211;a since beginning of last year, and this is how he responds,” a third chimed in. “As someone who is one of Serena’s biggest fans, posting Jill is not a gag lmao. At all.</p>

<p>Of course, as always, Drake had quite a few defenders, as well:</p>



<p>“You really think Drake is bothered? The lawsuit is in motion Let him laugh now, he’ll cry later,” one fan wrote.</p>



<p> “Drake owns Serena,” another added.</p>



<p> “Such a man of the culture. His son got a perfect role model. Kendrick could never touch this greatness,” a third remarked.</p>

<p>All of this comes as Drake and frequent collaborator Party Next Door released a new album.</p>



<p>One track, titled &#8220;Gimme a Hug,&#8221; seems to address the rapper&#8217;s recent feuds.</p>



<p>“Bulletproof doors so heavy, got me rolling ’round like a dignitary / Funny how it’s only bitch n-ggas that are waiting on The Boy’s obituary,&#8221; Drake raps on the song.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cause if I die, it’s these n-ggas that become the sole beneficiary / And what the fuck are they gon’ do with it? / Have the girls up at 29 on stage twerking with a dictionary?”</p>



<p>The last line seems to be a reference both to Kendrick&#8217;s hyper-literate rhymes and the fact that &#8220;Euphoria&#8221; &#8212; one of his diss tracks aimed at Drake &#8212; features as its cover, a dictionary definition of the word.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it seems that this beef is far from over.</p>

<p>There were many surprises at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/did-taylor-swift-get-engaged-fans-left-with-questions-after-travis-kelces-shocking-super-bowl-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl LIX</a> &#8212; the utter dominance of the Philadelphia Eagles being chief (pardon the pun) among them.</p>



<p>But while some pundits predicted an Eagles upset, there was one unexpected development on the field that <em>no one</em> saw coming:</p>



<p>Toward the end of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-kendrick-lamar-bad-blood-halftime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s halftime performance</a>, the rapper was joined by tennis legend Serena Williams. And the <em>timing</em> of her appearance gave it added significance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-serena-williams-dance-to-not-like-us">Why Did Serena Williams Dance to &#8216;Not Like Us&#8217;?</h2>



<p>Many of our readers might not remember that<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/08/serena-williams-to-drake-this-is-your-last-chance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Serena dated Drake</a> on and off from 2011 to 2015.</p>



<p>At the time, it was rumored that the relationship did not end amicably. And last night, Serena seemed to confirm as much by dancing to &#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick&#8217;s Grammy-winning Drake diss track</a>.</p>



<p>The appearance sent the message that Williams has sided with Lamar in the headline-making feud between two of hip hop&#8217;s biggest names.</p>

<p>Drake hasn&#8217;t responded to any aspect of Kendrick&#8217;s somewhat divisive performance. In fact, as he&#8217;s currently on tour in Australia, he might not have watched the Super Bowl at all.</p>



<p>Drizzy is a sports fan, but in Melbourne &#8212; where he performed last night &#8212; the game wouldn&#8217;t have kicked off until close to midnight.</p>



<p>But while we might never know if he stayed up until the wee hours to catch his rival&#8217;s halftime show, we do know that Drake&#8217;s exes were on his mind in the hours before the big game.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drake-bashes-exes-during-melbourne-concert">Drake Bashes Exes During Melbourne Concert</h2>



<p>While addressing the Aussie crowd, Drake disparaged exes who &#8220;play you in your f&#8211;king life.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/10/drake-exes-australia-show-super-bowl-halftime-sza-serena-williams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, he further pumped the audience up by telling them, &#8220;If you&#8217;re doing better than your ex, turn up to this song!&#8221; before launching into his breakup anthem &#8220;You Broke My Heart.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, Drake didn&#8217;t mention any of his exes by name, but if he caught early word of Serena&#8217;s performance, then she might have been the one who was most on his mind.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-650x1024.jpg" alt='Drake attends the "Top Boy" UK Premiere at Hackney Picturehouse on September 04, 2019 in London, England.' class="wp-image-518882" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-650x1024.jpg 650w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-190x300.jpg 190w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-768x1210.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-1300x2048.jpg 1300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-609x960.jpg 609w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-685x1080.jpg 685w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-762x1200.jpg 762w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1172270785-scaled.jpg 1625w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Drake attends the &#8220;Top Boy&#8221; UK Premiere at Hackney Picturehouse on September 04, 2019 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by John Phillips/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Whatever the case, it&#8217;s been a tough couple of weeks for the Toronto native.</p>



<p>It was just last Sunday that Kendrick won an astonishing five Grammys for &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221; And he followed up that historic night by performing for over 100 million viewers at the Super Bowl.</p>



<p>Will Drake fire back, or will he simply try and move on from this stage of his career?</p>



<p>Only time will tell, but something tells us Drizzy still has some tricks up his sleeve.</p>

<p>Does Taylor Swift have bad blood with Kendrick Lamar? Some of her fans think that she should.</p>



<p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Super Bowl</a> went down between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>



<p>The real attraction was, as always, the Halftime Show. This year, Kendrick Lamar put on a stellar performance, putting his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-Drake anthem</a> on display for tens of millions.</p>



<p>But one of the rapper&#8217;s most famous collaborations didn&#8217;t make the show. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="691" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-1024x691.jpg" alt="Kendrick Lamar on February 6, 2025." class="wp-image-518855" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-300x202.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-768x518.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-2048x1382.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-960x648.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-1080x729.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_01-1200x810.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kendrick Lamar speaks during the Super Bowl LVIX Pregame &amp; Apple Music Super Bowl LVIX Halftime Show Press Conference at Ernest N.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-didn-t-taylor-swift-join-kendrick-lamar-for-the-halftime-show">Why didn&#8217;t Taylor Swift join Kendrick Lamar for the Halftime Show?</h2>



<p>Kendrick Lamar was a natural pick for the Super Bowl&#8217;s Halftime Show. His music, and particularly the song, &#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; dominated a lot of discourse in 2024. It wasn&#8217;t quite the Song of the Summer (that was certainly &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-is-chappell-roan-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Luck, Babe</a>&#8220;), but it was a hot topic &#8212; and is almost <em>universally </em>known.</p>



<p>Often, when a Halftime Show performer announcement comes out, people speculate about who might join them for collaborations. Sometimes, a featured artist is more exciting than the headliner.</p>



<p>This year, most of the discussion was rather about how Drake would spend these next months dreading Kendrick&#8217;s performance. However, Halftime show collaborations were clearly on the minds of Taylor Swift&#8217;s fans.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-1024x682.jpg" alt="Ice Spice, Ashley Avignone, and Taylor Swift attend Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025." class="wp-image-518856" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_01-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ice Spice, Ashley Avignone, and Taylor Swift attend Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking to what remains of Twitter, Swifties lamented that Kendrick Lamar had not brought Taylor Swift onto the stage to perform &#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; in part or on whole.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bad Blood&#8221; was Taylor Swift&#8217;s <em>1989</em>-era feud anthem. Though the song did not originally feature Kendrick, he did appear and sing during the squad-studded music video.</p>



<p>“Just really feel like Bad Blood would’ve brought a little razzle dazzle to the halftime show,” <a href="https://x.com/abbygilbert77/status/1888765101584347311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> one disappointed fan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bad-blood-would-ve-brought-a-little-razzle-dazzle-to-the-halftime-show">&#8216;Bad Blood would&#8217;ve brought a little razzle dazzle to the halftime show&#8217;</h2>



<p>“Not me being so delusional i thought taylor swift might perform badblood with kendrick lamar,&#8221; another Twitter denizen <a href="https://x.com/honey_dna/status/1888766082988589440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confessed</a>.</p>



<p>“You have countless swifties watching the Super Bowl and you couldn’t simply ask Taylor for the rights to your version of bad blood,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Meggy_Katie/status/1888765977602490649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scolded</a> another Swiftie. &#8220;Pathetic!”</p>



<p>Yet another <a href="https://x.com/sara_nxoxo/status/1888766598464369062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>: “Kendrick had the opportunity to do the most iconic thing &amp; bring Taylor out for bad blood but he didn’t smh.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kendrick Lamar with many many Grammy awards on Feburary 2, 2025." class="wp-image-518857" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_kendricklamar_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kendrick Lamar, winner of Record Of The Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, Best Music Video and Song Of The Year for âNot Like Usâ, poses in the press room during the 67th GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Those are some bold &#8212; and, in some cases, insulting &#8212; opinions. But we should remember that these are coming from a particular strata of Taylor Swift fans, not necessarily from fans of Kendrick Lamar.</p>



<p>A diehard Batman fan might feel disappointed at superhero films that don&#8217;t feature their best boy. Similarly, if Taylor&#8217;s your fave, seeing a Halftime show without her might seem like a waste.</p>



<p>That said &#8230; Taylor Swift cannot headline every show. And, in this case, maybe it&#8217;s best that she didn&#8217;t.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on February 2, 2025 at the Grammy Awards." class="wp-image-518858" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0210_taylorswift_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maybe-it-s-best-that-kendrick-lamar-didn-t-ask-taylor-swift-to-join-him">Maybe it&#8217;s best that Kendrick Lamar didn&#8217;t ask Taylor Swift to join him</h2>



<p>Remember, a bunch of toxic bros <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-booed-by-hostile-crowd-at-super-bowl-lix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">booed Taylor</a> at the Super Bowl. Why? Presumably, because some have viewed her as a &#8220;distraction&#8221; from sportsball games over the past year and a half.</p>



<p>Additionally, there has been a wave of &#8220;revenge politics&#8221; in recent months (and years). Another <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/lauren-daigle-bounces-back-from-public-ridicule-to-sing-america-the-beautiful-at-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music performance</a> at this year&#8217;s Super Bowl makes it clear that many entities are catering to the worst among us.</p>



<p>Putting Taylor on stage might have invited unwelcome hostility towards her. It could also have distracted from Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s beautiful feud with Drake. Can we not spend time appreciating Kendrick for being, truly, one of the greatest haters of all time?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only February, but 2025 has already been quite a year for Kendrick Lamar. </p>



<p>The rapper <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home five Grammys</a> last Sunday for his 2024 song &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221; And he&#8217;s about to follow that up in epic fashion by performing during halftime at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-banned-from-taylor-swifts-super-bowl-suite-amid-justin-baldoni-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl LIX</a>.</p>



<p>Needless to say, no emcee on the planet is dominating the game quite like Kendrick at the moment.</p>

<p>And this new level of success has many fans wondering what K-Dot&#8217;s bank account is looking like.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-careers-of-kendrick-lamar">The Many Careers of Kendrick Lamar</h2>



<p>Kendrick is benefitting from numerous revenue streams these days.</p>



<p>In addition to multi-platinum singles like &#8220;Not Like Us&#8221; and chart-topping albums like last year&#8217;s <em>GNX</em>, he&#8217;s also one of the music world&#8217;s most in-demand collaborators.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-1024x683.jpg" alt="US rapper Kendrick Lamar performs during the 2023 Governors Ball Music Festival at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City on June 11, 2023." class="wp-image-518781" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1258627926-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">US rapper Kendrick Lamar performs during the 2023 Governors Ball Music Festival at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City on June 11, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by YUKI IWAMURA/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not only did he curate the acclaimed soundtrack for Marvel&#8217;s <em>Black Panther</em>, he&#8217;s also teamed up on tracks with artists like Beyonce, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/taylor-swift/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a>, SZA, and Rihanna.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s also a popular touring artist, and <em><a href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/brad-callas/kendrick-lamar-big-steppers-tour-highest-grossing-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Complex</a></em> estimates that Lamar earned more than $150 million for his last two trips around the world.</p>



<p>And as <em><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/a63690999/kendrick-lamar-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmo</a></em> points out, Kendrick has also inked endorsement deals with brands like Calvin Klein, Beats by Dre, and American Express.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Kendrick is one of the only artists ever to turn down an offer to headline Coachella &#8212; but something tells us he&#8217;s not too worried about missing that paycheck.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the man has a lot more going on than just his well-publicized feud with Drake.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kendrick-lamar-s-net-worth">Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s Net Worth </h2>



<p>So it should come as no surprise that Kendrick is seriously wealthy.</p>



<p>The website <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-rappers/kendrick-lamar-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> currently estimates his value at roughly $140 million. As always, it&#8217;s important to bear in mind that this is merely an estimate based on publicly available information about Kendrick&#8217;s holdings and career successes.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-702x1024.jpg" alt="Photo by Antony Jones/Getty Images for Spotify" class="wp-image-518797" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-702x1024.jpg 702w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-206x300.jpg 206w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-768x1120.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-1405x2048.jpg 1405w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-658x960.jpg 658w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-741x1080.jpg 741w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-823x1200.jpg 823w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404113082-scaled.jpg 1756w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kendrick Lamar poses backstage as Spotify hosts an evening of music with star-studded performances with DJ Pee .Wee aka Anderson .Paak and Kendrick Lamar, during Cannes Lions 2022, at Spotify Beach on June 20, 2022 in Cannes, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Antony Jones/Getty Images for Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Clearly, Kung-Fu Kenny has a long way to go if he wants to catch up to billionaire musicians like Taylor Swift and Rihanna, both of whom he&#8217;s collaborated with.</p>



<p>And while Lamar might have emerged victorious from his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-to-kendrick-lamar-i-dont-have-a-secret-daughterm-but-your-wife-cheated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud with Drake</a>, the perennially bankable Canadian is still winning the net worth war. According to recent estimates, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/drake-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake is worth roughly $250 million</a>.</p>



<p>But thanks to that beef, Kendrick has reached a new level of popularity and influence in recent months.</p>



<p>And that could mean that his most lucrative years are still ahead of him.</p>

<p>Diss tracks aren&#8217;t usually Grammy contenders, especially when they&#8217;re as scathing and controversial as Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221; But that didn&#8217;t stop Kendrick from taking home a whole lot of hardware on Sunday night.</p>



<p>In case you somehow missed it, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-to-kendrick-lamar-i-dont-have-a-secret-daughterm-but-your-wife-cheated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud between Kendrick and rival rapper Drake</a> went nuclear over the summer, with both artists lashing out at one another in song form.</p>



<p>The consensus was that Lamar emerged victorious, and last night, he cemented his win in historic fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Like Us&#8221; won five Grammys last night, including the awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.</p>



<p>Needless to say, that&#8217;s probably not the outcome that everyone&#8217;s favorite <em>Degrassi</em> alum was hoping for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-drake-at-the-grammys">Was Drake at the Grammys?</h2>



<p>To answer a question that&#8217;s on the minds of many social media users today &#8212; no, Drake was not in attendance at last night&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/grammys-2025-the-complete-list-of-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grammy Awards</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, it appears that he was quite far away, as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFf50ddTmKA/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his most recent Instagram post</a> shows him performing in Australia.</p>



<p>Drizzy has not yet commented on Kendrick&#8217;s massive night, but a courageous TikTok user managed to get his dad&#8217;s reaction.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, it seems that 70-year-old Dennis Graham would prefer to see his son up there winning all those awards. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>“I don’t care enough about that s&#8211;t,&#8221; Dennis said in response to a question about Kendrick.</p>



<p>“That ain’t got nothing to do with me. All the best to him, man. I don’t do that bulls&#8211;t.”</p>



<p>Okay, so the elder Graham kept it surprisingly civil. We&#8217;re guessing Drake won&#8217;t be quite as blasé when he addresses the matter in song form (which he pretty much has to at this point).</p>

<p>While things didn&#8217;t boil over until 2024, the Drake vs. Kendrick feud has been simmering for years.</p>



<p>And while some outlets are proclaiming that <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a63646138/kendrick-lamar-grammy-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last night&#8217;s Grammys marked the end of the beef</a>, that declaration seems premature.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/drake-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake is still suing his own label</a> in connection to &#8220;Not Like Us&#8221; and the allegations contained in the song&#8217;s lyrics.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197335854-1024x682.jpg" alt='Kendrick Lamar accepts the Song of the Year award for "Not Like Us" onstage during the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Among other claims, Kendrick alleges on the track that Drake and his friends are &#8220;certified pedophiles.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not the sort of insult that one just moves on from, and Drake&#8217;s fans will absolutely expect him to speak out on the situation on his next album.</p>



<p>For now, however, it seems that Kendrick is enjoying what might be the most definitive victory in the history of hip hop beefs.</p>



<p>And the victory lap will continue next week, when Kendrick performs during halftime at the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/taylor-swift-advances-to-the-super-bowl-and-so-do-the-kansas-city-chiefs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl</a>.</p>



<p>The ball is in Drake&#8217;s court at this point, but he would be foolish to make a move when his opponent is on such a hot streak.</p>

<p>Drake&#8217;s Toronto mansion was taped off by police last night following a shooting near the property.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/05/07/entertainment/drakes-security-guard-shot-outside-rappers-100m-toronto-mansion/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=news_alert&amp;utm_content=20240507?&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=NYP%20-%20News%20Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, the victim has now been identified as a security guard employed by Drake. The 48-year-old is believed to be in stable condition.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/TPSOperations/status/1787801316678398461">tweet</a> from Toronto police, shots were fired around 2:10 a.m. ET near the corner of Bayview and Lawrence Avenues.</p>



<p>The suspect is believed to have fled in a car immediately after the shots were fired.</p>

<p>The officers who responded to the call discovered a seriously wounded man who was taken to a nearby hospital.</p>



<p>Thankfully, no one else was harmed. Drake was not injured, and it&#8217;s unclear if he was at home at the time of the shooting.</p>



<p>The security guard&#8217;s injuries have been described by <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/07/world-news/drakes-property-taped-off-by-police-after-shooting-in-area-leaves-man-with-serious-injuries/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=news_alert&amp;utm_content=20240507?&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=NYP%20-%20News%20Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em> as non-life-threatening.</p>

<p>Initially, it was hoped that the conflict that led to the shooting had nothing to do with Drake.</p>



<p>The cause of the dispute remains unclear, but it looks increasingly as though the rapper was being targeted.</p>



<p>Social media speculators are already jumping to the conclusion that the incident was related to the ongoing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-to-kendrick-lamar-i-dont-have-a-secret-daughterm-but-your-wife-cheated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar</a>.</p>



<p>The war of words between Drake and Kendrick is the most high-profile hip hop beef in recent memory.</p>

<p>Many have compared the situation to the deadly war between Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. that played out in the mid-nineties.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Kendrick released a scathing diss track titled &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221; The song featured an aerial photo of Drake&#8217;s home on its cover.</p>

<p>The bad blood between the rappers has been simmering at least since last year. It boiled over in a big way in recent weeks, with both artists releasing multiple diss tracks directed at one another.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; the latest from Kendrick, begins with the line &#8220;I see dead people&#8221; and contains ominous references to the ways in which Drake&#8217;s recent remarks have sparked outrage.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these are just lines in a song, and at present, there&#8217;s no reason to believe that last night&#8217;s shooting had anything to do with the feud between Kendrick and Drake.</p>

<p>According to the <em>Post</em>, Drake&#8217;s house is at the center of the investigation. But that does not mean that the rapper was being targeted.</p>



<p>That said, Drake and his loved ones are likely taking extra precautions today.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar beef has turned into the messiest hip-hop  feud in recent memory.</p>



<p>The diss tracks have been dropping at such a furious rate that it&#8217;s hard even for diehard fans to keep up with all the allegations!</p>



<p>And now, the situation has become even more complex, thanks to Drake&#8217;s claim that he set a trap for his rival &#8212; and Kendrick walked right into it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="679" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-1024x679.jpg" alt="Drake speaks onstage during Drake's Till Death Do Us Part rap battle on October 30, 2021 in Long Beach, California." class="wp-image-499231" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-2048x1359.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-960x637.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-1080x716.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1350328655-1200x796.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Drake speaks onstage during Drake&#8217;s Till Death Do Us Part rap battle on October 30, 2021 in Long Beach, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kendrick-lamar-claims-that-drake-has-a-secret-daughter">Kendrick Lamar Claims That Drake Has a Secret Daughter</h2>



<p>We won&#8217;t bother to rehash the entire feud. After all, this thing has more chapters than <em>Lord of the Rings</em> at this point.</p>



<p>Instead, we&#8217;ll fast forward to Drake&#8217;s latest release, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/05/05/drake-fed-kendrick-lamar-misinformation-denies-pedophile-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;The Heart Part 6,&#8221;</a> in which the Toronto-based rapper once again makes things very personal by commenting on Kendrick&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Of course, to be fair, Drizzy is responding to some shocking claims about his own personal life.</p>



<p>On &#8220;Meet the Grahams,&#8221; Kendrick addressed an entire verse to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/05/pusha-t-drake-is-a-deadbeat-dad-who-wears-blackface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake&#8217;s son, Adonis</a>, who was hidden from the public until 2018 when Pusha T accused his rival of &#8220;hiding a child&#8221; in his song &#8220;The Story of Adidon.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a separate verse on &#8220;Grahams,&#8221; Kendrick attempts a similar bombshell, claiming that Drake also has an 11-year-old daughter whom he&#8217;s been keeping under wraps.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="731" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1153778011-1024x731.jpg" alt="Drake attends the LA Premiere Of HBO's &quot;Euphoria&quot; at The Cinerama Dome on June 04, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drake-fires-back">Drake Fires Back</h2>



<p>Now, in his latest salvo, Drake claims that he used a fake mole to feed Kendrick false information about his non-existent daughter.</p>



<p>(We told you this situation is complex!)</p>



<p>He also claims that Kendrick dropped another diss track, &#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; in order to distract from the mistake he made on &#8220;Grahams.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The one before the last one, we finessed you into telling a story that doesn&#8217;t even exist,&#8221; Drake raps.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Things get uglier from there, as Drake repeats his allegation that Kendrick&#8217;s creative partner Dave Free is also father to one of the rapper&#8217;s children.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kendrick Lamar performs during the 2023 Governors Ball Music Festival at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City on June 11, 2023." class="wp-image-499230" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1258628014-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kendrick Lamar performs during the 2023 Governors Ball Music Festival at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City on June 11, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by YUKI IWAMURA/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Why isn&#8217;t [Kendrick&#8217;s fiancee] Whitney [Alford] denying the allegations? Why is she following Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?&#8221; Drake raps.</p>



<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not the lesson, clearly there&#8217;s a deeper message,&#8221; he says at a different point in the song.</p>



<p>&#8220;Deep cuts that never healed, and now they got infected / Like if Dave really f&#8211;ked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin&#8217; resentment.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="659" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1153761244-1024x659.jpg" alt="Drake attends the LA Premiere of HBO's &quot;Euphoria&quot; at The Cinerama Dome on June 04, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Needless to say, this situation has escalated yet again.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s only a matter of time before Kendrick fires back with yet another seven-minute epic.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a fun time to be a hip hop fan &#8212; but we do hope that the feud doesn&#8217;t get out of hand and that everyone will keep this thing on wax.</p>

<p>However, after years of using his ill-gotten fame to harass female journalists and <a href="/2016/02/martin-shkreli-slams-ghostface-killah-id-smack-him-in-the-face-r/">pick fights with members of the Wu-Tang Clan</a>, the pharmaceutical CEO-turned-supervillain was recently forced to retreat back under from the bridge from whence he came.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="/2017/01/martin-shkreli-gets-banned-from-twitter-society-dares-to-dream-o/">Shkreli was banned from Twitter</a> recently after bullying a <em>Teen Vogue</em> writer, but he&#8217;s clearly devoted his newfound free time to finding new and interesting ways to make life worse for as many people as possible. </p>
<p>You see, one of Marty&#8217;s favorite activities is messing with hip-hop fans and famous rappers, the latter group, of course, being commonly known as a meek and mild-mannered lot, unlikely to do anything but cower in the face of opposition from a 34-year-old trust fund baby.</p>
<p>After his beef with Wu-Tang, <a href="/2016/12/martin-shkreli-vs-lil-wayne-unexpected-feud-alert/">Shkreli butted heads with Lil Wayne</a>, attracting the rapper&#8217;s attention by somehow pirating his unreleased <em>Carter V</em> album and releasing portions of it online without consent.</p>
<p>Now, Shkreli has apparently decided that he&#8217;ll continue antagonizing Wayne while simultaneously doing his best to piss off the hottest rapper on the planet right now for good measure.</p>

<p>Despite stern legal warnings from Team Weezy, Shkreli has released yet another track from <em>Tha Carter V</em>, this one featuring a guest verse from Kendrick Lamar.</p>
<p>TMZ has <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/05/03/martin-shkreli-lil-wayne-carter-v-mona-lisa-kendrick-lamar/">the stolen audio</a>, which doesn&#8217;t sound all that great with Shkreli shrieking over the track like some prep school DJ Khaled who was recently the recipient of a traumatic wedgie.</p>
<p>No word on what sort of legal consequences might be in play, but considering <a href="/2016/07/martin-shkreli-might-be-going-to-jail-loves-pokemon-go/">Shkreli is already facing jail time</a> on securities fraud charges, he&#8217;s really playing with fire.</p>
<p>Of course, getting sued would probably be a best-case scenario for Shkreli.</p>

<p>If this little stunt goes viral, Kung-Fu Kenny might put lil Marty in a spiral.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get that reference, go listen to Kendrick&#8217;s <em>Damn</em> in its entirety.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t be like Shkreli and pirate it.</p>
<p>In fact, don&#8217;t be like Shkreli in any aspect of your life.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right folks &#8212; we just hit you with the sort of advice that will guide you through your darkest hours.</p>
<p>Feel free to call us dad from now on.</p>
