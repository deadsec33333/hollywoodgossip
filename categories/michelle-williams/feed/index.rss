<p><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em>, the final movie in the Spider-Man villain trilogy, looks like it&#8217;ll be one hell of a film, if the trilogy is any indication.</p>



<p>It has humor, action, and enough conflicted Tom Hardy to go around. But it&#8217;s severely lacking in one thing:</p>



<p>Michelle Williams.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252-1024x682.jpg" alt="michelle williams and tom hardy reunited in venom" class="wp-image-501087" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1045575252.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Hardy  and Michelle Williams attend a photo call for Columbia Pictures&#8217; &#8220;Venom&#8221; at the Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills on September 27, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Where exactly is Brock&#8217;s ex-fiancee in all this commotion? Is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/12/michelle-williams-pregnant-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Williams</a> even returning for the last movie?</p>



<p>Or has she been &#8211; GASP- replaced?!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-venom-the-last-dance-trailer-watch-tom-hardy-s-final-turn-as-symbiote-villain">&#8216;Venom: The Last Dance&#8217; Trailer: Watch Tom Hardy&#8217;s Final Turn As Symbiote Villain</h2>



<p>All good things must come to an end, and after a decade of playing the brain-eating, symbiote villain Venom from the Spider-Man comics, Tom Hardy&#8217;s taking his final bow as Eddie Brock.</p>



<p>The trailer for <em>Venom</em> 3 dropped on Monday, June 3, proves that fans will get everything they&#8217;ve come to love about the franchise. More than that, fans will get something they&#8217;ve been clamoring for: more aliens!</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__2bjWbetsA?si=ZM1qeESJbgxxfhvt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“Eddie and Venom are on the run,&#8221; read the movie&#8217;s logline. &#8220;Hunted by both of their worlds and with the net closing in, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on Venom and Eddie’s last dance.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-venom-3-s-cast-brand-new-faces-but-where-s-michelle-williams">&#8216;Venom 3&#8217;s Cast: Brand New Faces, But Where&#8217;s Michelle Williams?</h2>



<p>In the trailer, we meet all the brand new characters joining the franchise. </p>



<p>Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor join the fold as scientists hell bent on stopping the alien invasion, with a specific interest in Eddie and Venom.  We also see the return of Mrs. Chen, played by Peggy Lu. </p>



<p>But you know who you don&#8217;t see? Anne Weying. You know, Michelle Williams&#8217; character. </p>



<p>Anne Weying is a pretty important person in Eddie/Venom&#8217;s life. Not only is she Eddie&#8217;s ex, but in the sequel, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em> , she actually morphed into She-Venom. </p>



<p>Are you really going to tell us that the trilogy is going to close out without her?! Well, we have some good news and bad news. </p>



<p>The bad news: her name isn&#8217;t anywhere to be found on the cast list. Between that and her not showing her face in the trailer, it doesn&#8217;t look good. </p>



<p>Except that Michelle really, REALLY loves the franchise!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-on-venom-3-return-bring-me-back">Michelle on &#8216;Venom 3&#8217; Return: &#8220;Bring Me Back&#8221;</h2>



<p>That&#8217;s the good news. Despite the movies failing to be box-office smashes, Michelle has loved every second of being in these films. </p>



<p>During a interview with<em> <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/michelle-williams-greast-showman-sequel-venom-1235265137/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>,</em> she made it clear her dearest hope is to reprise the role in <em>Venom 3</em>. &#8220;I have every intention of continuing with the series,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I certainly hope they bring me back.&#8221;</p>



<p>And why wouldn&#8217;t they! Honestly, the best part of the last movie was the She-Venom transformation. </p>



<p>The truth is, as this is the final film, some things might be being saved as a surprise. Like a cameo from Michelle &#8230; or another important figure in Venom&#8217;s life. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tom Holland at last Spider-man premiere" class="wp-image-501089" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1358900233.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Holland attends the Los Angeles premiere of Sony Pictures&#8217; &#8216;Spider-Man: No Way Home&#8217; on December 13, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-tom-holland-be-in-final-venom-film">Will Tom Holland Be In Final Venom Film?</h2>



<p>The last time fans truly saw Venom on the big screen was  in the <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> post-credits scene.</p>



<p>The movie, which features different Spider-Man villains transported into the mainline MCU, waited until the last second to introduce Spidey&#8217;s greatest foe into the narrative.  </p>



<p>At the end of <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, the alien baddie teleports into the MCU and sees <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/tom-holland-silence-francesca-amewudah-rivers-romeo-juliet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland’s </a>Peter Parker on a news broadcast. When we pick up with him in <em>No Way Home</em>, he’s zapped back to his universe — but not before leaving behind a gooey piece of his symbiote.</p>



<p>What happens in <em>Last Dance</em> will no doubt set the stage for what&#8217;s to come of Venom outside of his own franchise. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a rocky road for the wildly talented actress, who has a child with fellow icon Heath Ledger.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/01/busy-philipps-did-she-exploit-heath-ledgers-death-with-this-phot/">Ledger passed away</a> in 2008, and in the years since, Williams has balanced single motherhood with one of the most enviable careers in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But while few actresses have enjoyed greater success on screen, Michelle hasn&#8217;t been quite as lucky in her search for lasting love.</p>
<p><a href="/2018/07/michelle-williams-and-phil-elverum-married/">Williams married Phil Elverum</a> in 2018, but the couple called it quits just one year later.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="396" height="594" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/michelle-williams-attends-2017-oscars.jpg" alt="Michelle Williams Attends 2017 Oscars" class="wp-image-257398" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/michelle-williams-attends-2017-oscars.jpg 396w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/michelle-williams-attends-2017-oscars-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/michelle-williams-attends-2017-oscars-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/michelle-williams-attends-2017-oscars-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/michelle-williams-attends-2017-oscars-347x520.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /><figcaption>(2017 Ian West)</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the time of her wedding, Williams told<em> Vanity Fair </em>that she &ldquo;never gave up on love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it seems she remained true to that mantra in the difficult period after her split from Elverum.</p>
<p><em>Us Weekly</em> has confirmed today that Williams is engaged to Thomas Kail, who&#8217;s best known for directing <em>Hamilton</em> on Broadway.</p>
<p>Not only that, the couple is expecting a child together.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Michelle and Thomas met on the set of FX&#8217;s limited series <em>Fosse/Verdon</em>.</p>
<p>Williams has a history of dating artistically talented men.</p>
<p>Prior to her marriage, she was romantically linked to actor Jason Segel, director Spike Jonze, and author Jonathan Safran Foer.</p>
<p>While she and Ledger parted ways prior to his accidental overdose in 2008, Williams has always made it clear that her love and esteem for the father of her daughter has endured.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I always say to Matilda, &lsquo;Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said in an interview last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t settle. Don&rsquo;t settle for something that feels like a prison, or is hard, or hurts you. If it doesn&rsquo;t feel like love, it&rsquo;s not love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an amusing footnote to this story, former Destiny&#8217;s Child singer Michelle Williams says she&#8217;s received hundreds of misplaced congtatulatory messages this week.</p>
<p>She adds that she&#8217;s encouraged the enthusiastic fans to direct their kind words to the other Michelle Williams.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;d like to be the latest to wish Michelle and Thomas all the best in the year to come.</p>

<p>Michelle Williams covers the new issue of <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and inside the mag, she confirms that she&#8217;s now married to indie musician Phil Elverum.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In the most candid interview of her career, Williams gushed about her new husband and revealed the impetus behind her decision to finally open up about her personal life:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously I&rsquo;ve never once in my life talked about a relationship,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Phil isn&rsquo;t anyone else. And that&rsquo;s worth something.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole,&quot; Williams adds.</p>
<p>&quot;I work to be free inside of the moment. I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams has a daughter, 12-year-old Matilda, with the late <a href="/2018/01/busy-philipps-did-she-exploit-heath-ledgers-death-with-this-phot/">Heath Ledger, who passed away</a>&nbsp;in 2008.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;I never gave up on love. I always say to Matilda, &lsquo;Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes,&rsquo;&rdquo; she tells <em>Vanity Fair</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, Elverum is no stranger to tragedy himself.</p>
<p>In 2016, the singer&#8217;s first wife, musical artist Genevi&egrave;ve Castr&eacute;e, passed away from pancreatic cancer shortly after giving birth to the couple&#8217;s only daughter.</p>
<p>As for her decision to discuss her personal life after so many years of keeping a low profile, Williams says she felt compelled to speak out after realizing that her story might serve as a source of hope or inspiration for others who have experienced profound loss:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t really want to talk about any of it,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s that tease, that lure, that&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;What if this helps somebody?</p>
<p>&quot;What if somebody who has always journeyed in this way, who has struggled as much as I struggled, and looked as much as I looked, finds something that helps them?&rsquo;&quot;</p>
<p>Williams adds:</p>
<p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t settle. Don&rsquo;t settle for something that feels like a prison, or is hard, or hurts you,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t feel like love, it&rsquo;s not love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We wish Michelle and Phil all the best.</p>
<p>If anyone deserves happiness and companionship, it&#8217;s these two.</p>

<p>The beloved actor died of a drug overdose on January 22, 2008, leaving a daughter named Matilda that he shared with ex-wife Michelle Williams.</p>

<p>It was one of the saddest developments in recent Hollywood history.</p>
<p>To help her close friend cope with the sad occasion yesterday,&nbsp;Busy Philipps hopped on a plane and spent time with Williams, documenting the bonding session for all to see on social media.</p>
<p>And this is where the controversy now arises.</p>
<p>The former Cougar Town star shared a selfie on Instagram last night, one that features both her and Williams with forlorn looks on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; the actress wrote over the top of the snapshot, which depicts Williams burying her head on her good pal&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Check out the image here:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While some people on the Internet have found it sweet and sentimental, a bunch of others find it inappropriate and offensive.</p>
<p>These trolls basically think&nbsp;Philipps is exploiting her friend&#8217;s misery in order to make herself look good.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t want to be the cynical one here as I&#8217;m sure this was done with the best of intentions but&#8230; couldn&#8217;t this private moment have remained&#8230; private?&quot; wrote one online critic, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I just don&#8217;t see why this was necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;You might as well have just gone &#8216;LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT WHAT A GREAT FRIEND I AM&#8217;. Sending love anyway as I don&#8217;t doubt the emotions are genuine.&quot;</p>
<p>As you can see below, this same opinion was shared by quite a few Facebook users:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On one hand, we understand these points of view.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a bit strange to publicize what appears to be a private and very emotional moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand&#8230; come on, cynics of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Williams and Phillipps met on the set of Dawson&#8217;s Creek many years ago and are well known as the best of friends.</p>
<p>It seems nearly impossible to believe that Williams didn&#8217;t give Phillipps permission to share this snapshot.</p>
<p>Or, even if she somehow did not, it seems nearly impossible to believe that&nbsp;Phillipps meant any harm by posting the picture.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-683x1024.jpg" alt="Michelle Williams Snapshot" class="wp-image-14091" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michelle-williams-snapshot-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Ledger and Williams got close while filming Brokeback Mountain in 2005; they welcomed welcomed their daughter in October of 2005 and separated in September of 2007.</p>
<p>About a year later, Ledger was found dead from a cardiac arrest, which was the result of an, accidental overdose in his New York apartment.</p>
<p>He was 28 years old.</p>
<p>In tearful videos posted to her Instagram story on Monday, Philipps expressed extreme grief while driving in her car as the song &ldquo;Time to Pretend&rdquo; by MGMT plays in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just driving and I was thinking about my friend Heath who died 10 years ago and this song came on, &lsquo;Time to Pretend,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said in the footage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came out after he passed away and I remember when it came out, because [I thought] it made me think of him. I just thought he would have liked this song.</p>
<p>&quot;And for some reason, every time I hear this song&hellip; it&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>May Ledger continue to rest in peace.</strong></p>

<p>A few days after <a href="/2015/01/beyonce-pregnant-with-second-baby-mrs-carter-makes-possible-anno/">Beyonce posted a photo</a>&nbsp;of herself being buried in the sand, a baby bump seemingly on full display, friend and former colleague Michelle Williams appeared on The View this week and said simply of talk that Beyonce was knocked up again:</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s no truth to it.&quot;</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>&quot;First of all, if you look at the picture, the baby bump is like where her knees probably really are&#8230; so that&#8217;s it, really,&quot; Williams said of the above image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;All these allusions, just stop it, stop it, too many things.&quot;</p>
<p>It is true that the public has been alluding to a second child for Beyonce and Jay-Z for a long time now.</p>
<p>In September, baby fever swept Queen Bey Nation after&nbsp;Jay-Z performed in Paris and changed a line in &quot;Beach is Better&quot; to &quot;<a href="/2014/09/beyonce-pregnant-with-baby-number-2/">Cause she&#8217;s pregnant</a> with another one.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, Williams doesn&#8217;t seem to have any direct knowledge regarding the state of Beyonce&#8217;s womb. So there&#8217;s still hope!</p>
<p>Until another pregnancy is confirmed or denied by Music&#8217;s First Couple, Bey and J will be plenty busy with daughter Blue Ivy, an adorable tyke who <a href="/2015/01/happy-3rd-birthday-blue-ivy-carter/">just turned three years old</a>.</p>
<p>Where does the time go, people?!?</p>

<p>Also sort of making like <a href="/stars/miley-cyrus.html">Miley Cyrus</a>, Williams debuted the &#8216;do last night at the Kate Young for Target Launch in New York City.</p>
<p>Her blonde locks are clipped awfully short and a side-swept fringe either covers her face or is tossed to the side, depending on how she&#8217;s posing.</p>

<p>The Oscar winner poses for that publication&#8217;s latest issue (on an alternative cover) in what appears to be Native American attire, a look that has inspired many critics to react in horror and describe her costume as &#8220;redface.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the British magazine refuses to issue an apology, explaining instead via statement to Yahoo News:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>&#8220;While we recognize the seriousness of this debate, the image in question in no way intends to mimic, trivialize or stereotype any particular ethnic group or culture, as recent reports suggest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/michelle-williams-redface-another-magazine-210651177.html?.tsrc=Array">Williams is presented</a> in a &#8220;series of eight different imaginary characters,&#8221; the magazine concludes:</p>
<p>&#8220;All the characters in the story were inspired by multiple fashion and cultural references, characters and eras, as well as by our admiration of Ms. Williams as one of the most respected and talented actresses of her generation.</p>
<p>While we dispute the suggestion that the image has a racist subtext in the strongest possible terms, we&#8217;re mortified to think that anyone would interpret it in this way.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Michelle Williams in redface is&#8230;</em></p>

<p>The actors, both 32, quietly broke up earlier this month, sources say.</p>

<p>They seemed happy together as recently as January, when they were photographed on vacation in Cancun, but long distance <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/michelle-williams-jason-segel-split-2013262">reportedly did them in</a>.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>The stars kept an extremely low profile throughout their relationship, rarely acknowledging the romance in public or being photographed together on purpose.</p>
<p>Segel spoke vaguely about Michelle Williams last April, telling <em>Extra</em>, &#8220;I think we would just very much like to be happy. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wish them the best in this difficult time.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Michelle didn&#8217;t do the red carpet but wanted to be there for Jason&#8217;s big night,&#8221; an insider tells <em>Us Weekly</em>. &#8220;She snuck in to sit in the theater during the screening, then they all went over to the after party together where they were hanging out with his co-star Emily Blunt and Robert De Niro.&#8221;</p>
