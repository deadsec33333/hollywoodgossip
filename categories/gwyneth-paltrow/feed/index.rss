<p>The movie <em>Marty Supreme</em> won&#8217;t hit theaters until December.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s already receiving very negative reviews from Ms. Kylie Jenner.</p>



<p>The film stars Timothee Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow, the latter of whom has spoken openly about the many graphic sex scenes involving the two leads.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kylie Jenner and actor TimothÃ©e Chalamet look on during the Men's Singles Final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Daniil Medvedev of Russia on Day Fourteen of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2023 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City." class="wp-image-523205" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kylie Jenner and actor TimothÃ©e Chalamet look on during the Men&#8217;s Singles Final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Daniil Medvedev of Russia on Day Fourteen of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2023 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-says-she-and-timothee-do-a-lot-of-banging-in-upcoming-ping-pong-film">Gwyneth says she and Timothee do a lot of banging in upcoming ping pong film</h2>



<p>The film, directed by Josh Safdie, features Timothee as a professional ping pong player who carries on an affair with Gwyneth</p>



<p>“I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie. There’s a lot—a lot,&#8221; Paltrow explained to <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a></em>.</p>



<p>“There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator, which I did not know existed,” she added, noting that when the film&#8217;s intimacy coordinator asked her if she’d be comfortable with a particular move “I was like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on.’ ”</p>



<p>Gwyneth might have laughed the situation off, but it seems that Kylie failed to see the humor.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timothee are in a very serious relationship</a>, and it seems that she&#8217;s not keen on the idea of watching him pretend to bang someone else.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kylie-angry-about-the-reports-of-timmy-s-sex-scenes">Is Kylie angry about the reports of Timmy&#8217;s sex scenes?</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/timothee-chalamet-sex-scenes-ban-jealous-kylie-jenner-gwyneth-paltrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>, Kylie is furious over the film&#8217;s sultry content, and she&#8217;s instructed Timothee not to film any more sex scenes.</p>



<p>“Timothee has no problem being intimate in movies, but Kylie doesn&#8217;t like it. She doesn&#8217;t appreciate all the details and doesn&#8217;t want him to film any more sex scenes moving forward,&#8221; a source tells the outlet.</p>



<p>And apparently, this is no small matter. In fact, the insider claims that it&#8217;s resulted in the worst rough patch of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/is-kylie-jenner-pregnant-timothee-chalamet-would-be-the-likely-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timothee&#8217;s relationship</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1024x683.jpg" alt="Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner attend a match during the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on March 09, 2025 in Indian Wells, California." class="wp-image-523206" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner attend a match during the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on March 09, 2025 in Indian Wells, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;It has been the main source of tension between them lately, and it’s something that has been deeply bothering them,” said the insider.</p>



<p>The source added that Chalamet&#8217;s inner circle is concerned about the ways in which Kylie&#8217;s puritanical rule might limit his career prospects.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wants to explore everything as an actor and artist. It&#8217;s the biggest moment of tension between them since they started dating,&#8221; the insider added.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that Timmy&#8217;s loved ones have expressed misgivings about the relationship.</p>



<p>One insider recently described Kylie and Timothee as &#8220;two complete opposites.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;Many of us don&#8217;t understand how they connect and click.&#8221;</p>



<p>But hey &#8212; as long as Kylie and Timothee understand the attraction, that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>



<p>We just hope she&#8217;ll open up to the idea that pretending to fall for other people is part of Timmy&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>“They were both good kissers,” the 52-year-old said when the topic turned to these past lovers&#8230; but host Alex Cooper wanted to learn more.</p>



<p>She asked Paltrow “who was better in bed,” and Paltrow actually answered!</p>



<p>Kind of. Sort of.</p>



<p>To at least <em>some</em> extent.</p>

<p> “That is really hard,&#8221; Paltrow responded, prior to delivering the following revealing response: </p>



<p>&#8220;Brad was, like, the sort of major chemistry, love of your life, kind of, at the time. And then Ben was, like, technically excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Interesting, right? Paltrow appears to be saying that Pitt wins in the passion department, but Affleck comes out on top in terms of technique.</p>



<p>&#8221; I can’t believe my daughter is listening to this! … Am I blushing?” Paltrow added on the podcast.</p>

<p>Paltrow and Pitt met on the set of Se7en in 1994 and got engaged in 1996.</p>



<p>After that relationship ended, the star moved on with Affleck, with whom she was romantically linked from 1997 to 2000.</p>



<p>“I’m not sure I would characterize either of them as high maintenance. … I’m not sure [who cared more about their appearance],&#8221; Paltrow also said on Tuesday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like neither of them are very vain like that. I’m not attracted to guys who are, like, looking at the mirror the whole time. </p>



<p>&#8220;Although, Ben did have, like, a mirror face that he would throw at the mirror. He had a funny mirror face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paltrow also struggled when asked who was better at his job.</p>



<p>“They’re both so talented. I feel like Ben is a great writer and director, but, I guess, I would probably have to say acting along Brad,” Paltrow responded. </p>



<p>“If you think of all the really different roles he’s done&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben is great too, they’re both great.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, Meghan Markle is currently working hard to make a name for herself as a lifestyle mogul.</p>



<p>And with a successful <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix cooking show</a> and her own line of luxury housewares, she&#8217;s off to a good start.</p>



<p>But the established icons of that world &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bethenny-frankel-blasts-meghan-markles-martha-stewart-perfect-persona/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Martha Stewart</a> &#8212; may not have been as welcoming as Meghan would have hoped. </p>



<p>And now, the Duchess of Sussex has gone on the attack against Stewart, making it clear that <em>no one</em> will stop her from claiming her place as queen of the kitchen. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain's Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary." class="wp-image-522389" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain&#8217;s Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by KOLA SULAIMON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-to-martha-don-t-test-me">Meghan to Martha: &#8216;Don&#8217;t test me&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;I had the entire British tabloid media come after me &#8212; and those people are full-blown evil. If Martha Stewart thinks I&#8217;m scared of her, she&#8217;s got another thing coming,&#8221; Meghan said this week in an interview with Sidd Finch of <em>Variety</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only so much disrespect I&#8217;m willing to tolerate, and if Martha keeps pushing me, she&#8217;s gonna find out where my line is,&#8221; the duchess added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the situation to get physical, but I&#8217;m not opposed to taking it there. I&#8217;m from LA, okay? What Kendrick did to Drake will look like an act of mercy by the time I&#8217;m done with Martha.&#8221;</p>



<p>Obviously, these are not the kind of comments we&#8217;re accustomed to hearing from Meghan.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2177016324-9-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attends the 2024 Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Gala at L.A.

<p>But it&#8217;s worth noting that she and Prince Harry have been forced to deal with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-prince-harry-accused-of-bullying-non-profit-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one controversy after another</a> in 2025. And clearly, all that negative press is beginning to take a toll.</p>



<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re supposed to think Martha is this supreme badass because she hangs out with Snoop and she served some time? B-tch, please,&#8221; Meghan continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;If you ask me, they should&#8217;ve left that loser in jail. She was more useful making pinecone centerpieces for her fellow jailbirds than she&#8217;s ever been out here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not to be outdone, Martha took to social media to respond with some scathing remarks of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is the Duchess mad at me?&#8221; Martha wrote in a lengthy screed that appeared on her Facebook page at 3:17 this morning.</p>



<p>Stewart also added a photo of Queen Elizabeth II, writing, &#8220;Meghan, I might be 83, but this won&#8217;t be the first time that you got wrecked by an old lady.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reached for comment, fellow lifestyle maven Gwyneth Paltrow told <em>Variety</em>:</p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly, I hope they settle it in the ring. I&#8217;m sick of all the yapping from those two. And if either one of them tries to come at <em>me</em>, I&#8217;ll roll up with my whole Goop Troop behind me, know what I mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Gwyneth proceeded to make &#8220;elaborate&#8221; gunshot sound effects for several minutes.</p>



<p>We really don&#8217;t know what to say about this story, other than &#8212; April Fools! </p>

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow has exposed Nikki Glaser for trying to bang her ex.</p>



<p>And the best part of this story is that Nikki is not denying that she <em>repeatedly</em> reached out to Ben Affleck in an effort to score a spot in the Batfleck&#8217;s bed.</p>



<p>That surprising revelation came during the latest episode of Gwyneth&#8217;s podcast.</p>

<p>During a conversation about the dating app Raya, Nikki surprised the Goop goddess by revealing her attempts to bang Ben. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nikki-glaser-says-she-was-rebuffed-by-ben-affleck">Nikki Glaser says she was rebuffed by Ben Affleck</h2>



<p>“When I used to be on Raya and he would come across, [I would give him a] very concentrated check mark ‘yes’ and, like, never [got] it back,” <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nikki-glaser-on-sex-shame-stand-up/id1352546554?i=1000700715708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glaser said</a>.</p>



<p>Gwyneth dated Ben way back in the &#8217;90s, so she obviously wasn&#8217;t upset about Nikki&#8217;s confession. In fact, she seemed to find the situation downright hilarious.</p>



<p>These days, Paltrow is in a serious relationship with producer Brad Falchuk, whom she&#8217;s been dating since 2018. For her part, Nikki has been in an on-again, off-again relationship with Chris Convy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-682x1024.jpg" alt="Nikki Glaser attends the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California." class="wp-image-522182" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2192553103-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nikki Glaser attends the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So she&#8217;s probably over the Affleck rejection (to the extent that one <em>can</em> get over such a thing). But Nikki still vividly recalls the many A-list dudes she encountered during her time on Raya.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-could-ve-had-a-glarfield-romance">We could&#8217;ve had a Glarfield romance</h2>



<p>&#8220;I think Andrew Garfield&#8217;s face came up for me so many times. Multiple times,&#8221; Glaser said.</p>



<p>&#8220;That would have been a good one. He&#8217;s gorgeous,&#8221; Paltrow replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he just didn&#8217;t see my profile, even though I clicked on his a [million times]. They&#8217;ll keep serving you up the same people, like, again and again for some reason,&#8221; Glaser added.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1986673516-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Nikki Glaser attends the 5th Annual Jam For Janie GRAMMY Awards Viewing Party at Hollywood Palladium on February 4, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>&#8220;So every time I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yes, Andrew Garfield, like, duh.&#8217; This is years and years ago. I don&#8217;t want to put anything out there, but, like, yes. Yes. Yes,&#8221; she further explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I know for a fact he had to have seen my profile and gone, &#8216;Nope,&#8217; because sometimes they send people that you keep saying no to? So, like, I would have matched with him if he was interested.&#8221;</p>



<p>These days, Garfield is rumored to be dating <em>A Complete Unknown</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/tom-cruise-new-girlfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monica Barbaro</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ben-connection">The Ben connection</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-1024x746.jpg" alt="The cast from the film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (L-R: Rupert Everett, Geoffrey Rush, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Affleck) pose with their awards for 'Outstanding Performance by a movie cast' at the fifth Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA, 07 March." class="wp-image-522181" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-300x218.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-768x559.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-960x699.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-1080x787.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192-1200x874.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1935919192.jpg 1984w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The cast from the film &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; (L-R: Rupert Everett, Geoffrey Rush, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Affleck) pose with their awards for &#8216;Outstanding Performance by a movie cast&#8217; at the fifth Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA, 07 March.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by LUCY NICHOLSON / AFP) (Photo by LUCY NICHOLSON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though Gwyneth broke up with Ben and he denied Nikki&#8217;s advances, it seems that neither of then harbors any ill will toward the Oscar winner.</p>



<p>Though Gwyneth killed off her ex and Shakespeare In Love costar during a game of &#8220;F&#8211;k, Marry, Kill,&#8221; she also described him as &#8220;excellent&#8221; in bed during a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/26/celebrity-news/gwyneth-paltrow-nikki-glaser-wanted-to-f-k-ex-ben-affleck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a>.</p>



<p>As for Nikki, she recently revealed to Howard Stern that she cut a joke about Ben out of her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/nikki-glaser-expects-to-be-canceled-after-hosting-golden-globes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globes monologue</a>.</p>



<p>“‘Here’s to Ben Affleck. I can’t wait to see which Jennifer you try to ruin next.’ … That would have been insane,” she told Stern.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Ben appreciates that she decided not to go that route!</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is making a name for herself as a lifestyle guru.</p>



<p>The Duchess of Sussex has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Netflix show</a>, and she&#8217;s currently in the process of rolling out her own luxury brand.</p>



<p>Of course, by entering the lifestyle space, Meghan is inviting comparisons to famous predecessors like Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>



<p>Gaining the approval of these queens of the kitchen would surely bolster the legitimacy of Meghan&#8217;s latest business venture &#8212; unfortunately, that approval has been hard to come by.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been widely rumored that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martha is not a fan of Meghan&#8217;s latest pivot</a> and would prefer to see the duchess stay in her lane.</p>



<p>And Gwyneth? Well, that situation is a little harder to read.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-paltrow-may-have-had-a-change-of-heart-about-meghan-markle">Gwyneth Paltrow may have had a change of heart about Meghan Markle</h2>



<p>At first, Gwyneth seemed supportive of Meghan&#8217;s new career.</p>



<p>“I don’t know Meghan and Harry. I mean, I’ve met Meghan, who seems really lovely, but I don’t know her at all. Maybe I’ll try to get through their security detail and bring them a pie,&#8221; Paltrow told<em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Vanity Fair</a></em> last week.</p>



<p>Asked about Meghan’s lifestyle show and brand, Gwyneth explained that when “there’s noise about certain women in the culture, I do have, always, a strong instinct to stand up for them….Everybody deserves an attempt at everything that they want to try.”</p>

<p>But on the heels of those remarks, Gwyneth posted an Instagram clip (above) in which she seems to be making light of Meghan&#8217;s new persona.</p>



<p>Fans noted that Gwyneth paired the footage with “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)” by Natalie Cole, a song that Meghan used in the promos for her show.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-kitchen-skills-get-roasted-in-the-comments">Meghan&#8217;s kitchen skills get roasted in the comments</h2>



<p>In the comments section of the post, fans were convinced that Gwyneth was throwing shade at Meghan, and many noted that she filmed the scene in her own home (Meghan famously shot her show at a rental property).</p>



<p>“Gwyneth Paltrow continues to throw shade &amp; I’m here for it! No makeup in her actual kitchen!” commented one user (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-netflix-show-is-awful-should-end-the-career-of-thirsty-star-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Markle filmed her show</a> in the kitchen of a nearby rental home).</p>

<p>“Gwyneth is so genuine what a breath of fresh air compared to Markle,” added another, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/23/celebrity-news/fans-think-gwyneth-paltrow-is-throwing-shade-at-meghan-markle-in-new-cooking-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“Love this. No fake house, fake kitchen, fake hair extensions, fake friends just your beautiful true self. Such a breath of fresh air to see,” said a third person.</p>



<p>“Lol isn’t it this the song they keep using in the Meghan Markle promo?” a fourth chimed in.</p>



<p>So yeah, whether Gwyneth intended to shade Meghan or not, fans are interpreting the clip as an actor of hostility.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-keeps-it-simple-on-instagram">Meghan keeps it simple on Instagram</h2>



<p>In other Meghan news, the duchess shared a new photo of her kids this week. Once again, their faces are obscured, but we can see that they&#8217;re both sporting red hair.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t catch many glimpses of the Sussex children, as their parents are understandably protective of their privacy. But Harry recently confirmed that they both take after him in the hair department.</p>



<p>&#8220;Definitely my mum. The ginger gene is a strong one!&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/meghan-markle-princess-lilibet-prince-archie-star-new-photo-red-hair-11702165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry told Stephen Colbert</a> when asked which royals the kids most resemble.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Spencer gene is very, very strong,&#8221; Harry added, referring to his mom&#8217;s maiden name. &#8220;I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids that there&#8217;s no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife&#8217;s genes, but I was wrong! Go gingers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps by posting the new pic, Meghan was trying to send the message that she&#8217;s bigger things to worry about than petty social media drama.</p>



<p>Or maybe she&#8217;s just genuinely unaware of Gwyneth&#8217;s subtle shade!</p>

<p>Chris Martin knew the sting of a divorce long before<em> whatever&#8217;s</em> going on with him at the moment.</p>



<p>Because it is all very confusing, we know!</p>



<p>In early 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/chris-martin-dakota-johnson-engaged-after-6-years-of-dating-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson&#8217;s engagement</a> became public knowledge. This followed years of secrecy.</p>

<p>Not even six months later, news broke that the pair had split after seven years together &#8212; only for a competing report to drop hours later insisting they were still together!</p>



<p>So, what is the truth here? Are they together or not? If not, is this a breakup or a divorce? Are we in the middle of an uncoupling sequel or just a miscommunication? </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive in. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chris-martin-s-divorce-from-gwyneth-paltrow-a-decade-of-love">Chris Martin&#8217;s Divorce From  Gwyneth Paltrow: A Decade of Love</h2>



<p>To really understand the Coldplay<em> </em>frontman&#8217;s current relationship status, it&#8217;s important to remember how we got here.</p>



<p>While he reportedly had a previous relationship with events producer Lily Sobhani, Chris Martin&#8217;s most famous relationship was and remains with Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>



<p>Paltrow and Martin met in October of 2002. This was backstage at a Coldplay concert.</p>



<p>One year later, their house-hunting in North London inspired wedding rumors. Things had evidently become serious, and <em>quickly</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wedding-bells-babies-and-then-divorce">Wedding Bells, Babies &#8211; And Then Divorce</h2>



<p>Soon after, in December of 2003, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin confirmed that they were expecting their first child as a couple. </p>



<p>Two days later, on December 5, the two secretly married in Santa Barbara. The hush-hush ceremony was so small that not even Paltrow&#8217;s mother received an invite.</p>



<p>In May of 2004, the now-married couple welcomed their daughter, whom they infamously named Apple.</p>

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin confirmed in January 2006 that they were once again expecting. In April, they welcomed Moses Martin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Moses&#8221; means &#8220;to draw out&#8221; and refers to a religious figure from the Torah. However, the couple revealed that they had named their second child after the Coldplay song, &#8220;Moses,&#8221; which Chris Martin wrote about Gwyneth Paltrow in 2003.</p>



<p>The happy times went on for years, with public dates and gushing about each other. Until 2013, when the couple began admitting to <em>challenges </em>in their relationship.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-paltrow-amp-chris-martin-s-divorce">Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; Chris Martin&#8217;s Divorce</h2>



<p>On March 25, 2014, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin announced their divorce in a notorious entry on her <em><a href="https://goop.com/wellness/relationships/conscious-uncoupling-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goop</a></em> brand website.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much, we will remain separate,&#8221; the couple wrote. They continued: &#8220;We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways we are closer than we have ever been.&#8221;</p>



<p>The announcement added: &#8220;We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-for-many-consciously-uncouple-is-our-roman-empire">For many, &#8216;consciously uncouple&#8217; is our Roman Empire</h2>



<p><em>Consciously uncouple </em>has become a joking part of many people&#8217;s lexicons ever since. However, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin also went through with an actual divorce.</p>



<p>The exes finalized their divorce in April of 2015.</p>



<p>Despite that, they remained co-parents and good friends ever after. This did not change when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/gwyneth-paltrow-compares-the-sexual-talents-of-ben-affleck-and-brad-pitt-who-did-her-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paltrow moved on</a>, marrying Brad Falchuk in 2018.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chris-martin-and-dakota-johnson-is-history-repeating-itself">Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson:  Is History Repeating Itself? </h2>



<p>Speaking of moving on, Chris Martin also moved on after the divorce. He has been dating actor and nepo baby <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/dakota-johnson-cracks-tone-deaf-armie-hammer-jokes-hed-have-cannibalized-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dakota Johnson</a> since 2017. The pair have kept their affairs very private. </p>



<p>They never attend movie premieres together, never show up on each other&#8217;s arms at the Oscars &#8211; nothing like that. But things nevertheless have gotten serious for the pair. So much in fact, that marriage was on the horizon. </p>



<p>In the spring of 2024, the world learned that they were engaged, and had quietly been for years.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Martin of Coldplay performs onstage at Rose Bowl Stadium on September 30, 2023 in Pasadena, California." class="wp-image-518540" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1710794878-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Martin of Coldplay performs onstage at Rose Bowl Stadium on September 30, 2023 in Pasadena, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Within weeks, the rumor mill churned out all kinds of conflicting stories. Some outlets took the stance that they were actually already married, or at least very close to it. Meanwhile, others hinted that the pair may never make it down the aisle.</p>



<p>“Dakota has gotten cold feet. She loves Chris, but she’s still not sure about marriage. She’s seen too many of them end in divorce. Her mother, Melanie Griffith, has been married three times, and her father, Don Johnson, got hitched twice, so she’s hesitant to take the plunge herself. She’s not a runaway bride — she’s just not sure marriage is for her,” an insider told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/dakota-johnson-wants-to-postpone-chris-martin-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a>.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-chris-and-dakota-still-together">Are Chris and Dakota Still Together?</h2>



<p>Officially, it sounds like the pair are sticking it out. </p>



<p>In August of 2024, <em>The Daily Mail </em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13750157/Chris-Martin-fiancee-Dakota-Johnson-split-engagement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson had broken up. Their source seemed pretty firm that the pair couldn&#8217;t make the romance work any longer. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Chris and Dakota have tried desperately hard over the past few months to make their relationship work. They’ll always have love for each other but they’ve both come to the conclusion the relationship cannot be sustained long-term.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then, just a few hours later,  <em>People </em><a href="https://people.com/dakota-johnson-chris-martin-have-not-broken-up-happily-together-exclusive-8696582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the breakup news was false. The couple&#8217;s representative affirmed that they &#8220;are happily together.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a pretty firm debunking. And it&#8217;s the best that we have to go on until the next relationship update.</p>

<p>Are Chris Martin and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/dakota-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dakota Johnson</a> engaged?</p>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/chris-martin-dakota-johnson-engaged-32290448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a></em>, the couple is currently preparing to tie the knot after six years of dating.</p>



<p>A source tells the outlet that Chris popped the question “a while ago,” but he and Dakota have managed to keep their marital plans under wraps.</p>



<p>Dakota did not seem to be sporting an engagement ring during her recent press tour to promote her poorly received superhero movie <em>Madame Web</em>. </p>

<p>That might have been a mistake, as a rock on her finger could&#8217;ve provided a welcome opportunity to talk about anything other than the film. We kid!</p>



<p>Anyway, the insider says that Chris and Dakota&#8217;s engagement will not come as a surprise to those closest to the couple, as they&#8217;ve been head over heels for each other for quite some time.</p>



<p>“They have been besotted with each other from day one so taking this next step was inevitable,” a source claimed to the publication Wednesday.</p>

<p>“They are in no rush to plan the wedding but are just enjoying making their commitment official.”</p>



<p>It would be the first marriage for Dakota and the second for Chris, who finalized his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/03/chris-martin-split-from-gwyneth-paltrow-was-a-weird-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce from Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in 2016. </p>

<p>Fortunately, Dakota has Gwyneth&#8217;s blessing, and the actresses have long enjoyed a close friendship.</p>

<p>Insiders say Gwyneth feels that Dakota has been a positive influence in the lives of her two children with Chris, and Johnson has spoken lovingly about the teens on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>“I love those kids like my life depends on it. With all my heart,” Dakota said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/dakota-johnson-teatime-book-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bustle</a>.</p>



<p>Dakota also revealed that she might one day like to have children of her own.</p>

<p>“I’ve gotten to this place where I really want to experience everything that life has to offer,” said the actress and daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith.</p>



<p>“And especially being a woman, I’m like, ‘What a magical f–king thing to do. What a crazy, magical, wild experience.’ If that’s meant to happen for me, I’m totally down for it.”</p>



<p>Given how much these two enjoy their privacy, it might be a while before we find out if Dakota and Chris are planning on welcoming any children.</p>

<p>When she saw a stray tweet that disparaged the &quot;saggy&quot; boobs of 40-year-olds, she didn&#8217;t let it slide.</p>
<p>Gwyneth took the OP to task, insisting that &quot;forties titties&quot; could be &quot;all that and a pack of chips.&quot;</p>

<p>A mostly body-positive tweet that unfortunately excluded older people took off on Twitter.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone just asked me if my boobs always have to be out,&quot; the tweet begins.</p>
<p>&quot;LMAO yes bitch,&quot; the post reads. &quot;They do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;i&rsquo;m 21 years old,&quot; the tweet continues. &quot;This is prime titty time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When i&rsquo;m 40 and they&rsquo;re saggy,&quot; the writer promises. &quot;I&rsquo;ll put them away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But until then,&quot; she asks. &quot;Can shut your mother teresa turtleneck wearing ass up and mind your damn business.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Anything that you post could always get screencapped and shared by someone hoping to boost their own page using your words.</p>
<p>That is what happened with this post about young boobs &#8212; and a certain <em>Goop </em>fiend saw them.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey now,&quot; Gwyneth Paltrow interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;40&rsquo;s titties can still be all that and a pack of chips,&quot; she wrote indignantly.</p>
<p>Gwyneth concluded her admonishment: &quot;Don&rsquo;t you forget it.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>Goop </em>founder is 46 years old and understandably was feeling a little defensive of tatas everywhere.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone believes that Gwyneth writes her own social media comments.</p>
<p>&quot;These comments from gwyn are fake as f&#8211;k,&rdquo; a post accused back in February.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel bad for poor millennial that ghost writes them,&quot; the accusation expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hope they are getting paid well,&quot; the conspiracy theorist wrote. &quot;Or some goop credit.&quot;</p>
<p>If the idea of getting paid in <em>Goop </em>credit sends a chill down your spine, don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>Maybe a nice <em>vaginal steaming</em> will warm you right up.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That conspiracy theory did not go unseen or unchallenged.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit on it,&quot; Gwyneth herself fired back. &quot;I write all this dumb stuff myself you jackass.&quot;</p>
<p>She then suggested that she uses social media to relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else do moms do in the bath with a glass of wine?&quot; she asks.</p>
<p>We have to say that we believe her.</p>
<p>What person under 39 would write &quot;all that and a pack of chips&quot; in any context?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Now, Gwyneth may have jumped the gun a little bit when she called out that boob post.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old who&#8217;s proud to have her boobs on display was speaking of herself.</p>
<p>Nowhere did she insist that women in their forties are obligated to pack away their breasts in storage.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t even say that they&#8217;re all saggy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that she expects that <em>her </em>boobs will be saggy when she&#8217;s literally twice as old as she is now.</p>

<p>Some older folks may question Gwyneth&#8217;s use of the word &quot;titties.&quot;</p>
<p>For a long time, it was used as a derogatory term to dehumanize women by discussing their body parts.</p>
<p>However, the term &#8212; and its variant spelling, <em>tiddies </em>&#8212; has been reclaimed in recent years.</p>
<p>People proudly discuss their own titties, and we say people because it&#8217;s an increasingly gender-neutral term.</p>
<p>Guys, gals, and nonbinary pals alike may discuss their own &quot;tits.&quot;</p>
<p>Seriously, if you see a discussion of Henry Cavill on social media, you&#8217;re more likely than not to find someone mention <em>his </em>tiddies.</p>
<p>We basically never say this, but good for Gwyneth for helping to take the sting out of a very fun word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Gwyneth Paltrow very clearly resides in her very own universe.</p>
<p>In case this wasn&#8217;t obvious based on the bizarre and expensive items the actress peddles on Goop, Paltrow has now shown no shame in freely admitting the following:</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on between <a href="/2019/02/khloe-kardashian-finally-dumps-tristan-thompson/">Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To&nbsp;Paltrow&#8217;s credit, if you want to phrase it that way, she <em>does</em> apparently read the Internet.</p>
<p>She <em>is</em> evidently aware that Thompson is trending today for some reason; she just doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s beause he cheated on Khloe Kardashian with one of her good friends, <a href="/slideshows/jordyn-woods-who-is-kylie-jenners-bff-who-made-out-with-tristan/">Jordyn Woods</a>.</p>
<p>She seemingly has no idea that Thompson stands accused of inviting Woods over to his house on Sunday night and then making out with her on the couch and then not saying goodbye to her until 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Or that she learned about this affair through <a href="/2019/02/khloe-kardashian-how-she-learned-the-awful-truth-about-tristan-t/">a series of very awkwad text messages</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, Paltrow is mostly clueless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she&#8217;d at least like to have a clue.</p>
<div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/khloe-kardashian-shades-jordyn-woods-puts-on-brave-face-for-the/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1766" height="2560" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-scaled.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="No Reason to Smile" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-scaled.jpg 1766w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-706x1024.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-768x1114.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-1059x1536.jpg 1059w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-1412x2048.jpg 1412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-735x1066.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-231x335.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-239x347.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-359x520.jpg 359w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-441x640.jpg 441w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-530x768.jpg 530w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-662x960.jpg 662w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/no-reason-to-smile-745x1080.jpg 745w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></div><h2 class="block-title">Khloe Kardashian Shades Jordyn Woods, Puts on Brave Face for the Press</h2></div></a><div class="block-data"><div class="block-button"><a class="btn" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/khloe-kardashian-shades-jordyn-woods-puts-on-brave-face-for-the/"><span>VIEW GALLERY</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="arrow-right" width="32px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 32 12"><g transform="translate(0,12) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill="#000000" stroke="none"><path d="M240 60 l0 -61 35 27 c19 14 35 30 35 34 0 4 -16 20 -35 34 l-35 27 0 -61z"/><path d="M4 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M84 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M164 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>We know this because someone hilariously wrote the following on Instagram today in response to this sordid story:</p>
<p><em>Jordyn Woods is best friends with the worlds youngest billionaire who gifts her with cars, diamonds, and lavish vacations. </em></p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re telling me there&rsquo;s a chance she gave that all up for a guy who rides bench for the Cavs and has a community d&mdash;? THE HORROR.</em></p>
<p>Thompson is actually averaging 29.8 minutes per game this year for Cleveland, but that isn&#8217;t the point right now.</p>
<p>The point is that Paltrow actually stumbled across this comment and replied with one of her own. It reads:</p>
<p><em>Can someone explain what&rsquo;s going on? I have never heard of half of these people, someone give me context. Please. It seems serious</em></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Assuming Paltrow is familiar with Khloe, simply due to the pervasive nature of her family in the entertainment industry, this is a rather funny way of throwing shade at Thompson.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s even funnier because we totally believe that the actress legitimately has no idea who he is.</p>
<p>Cardi B, conversely, is very familiar with both people involved in this scandal.</p>
<p>And, as always, she has an opinion to share.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Why us women don&#8217;t have compassion toward each other? Y&#8217;all know I&#8217;ve been through some shit, I know y&#8217;all know I&#8217;ve been through some shit,&quot; the rapper said to her followers on Thursday, clearly angry at those taking Khloe to task for some reason.</p>
<p>&quot;This whole Khloe Kardashian thing and everybody is like celebrating that that happened to her. It&#8217;s like, why?</p>
<p>&quot;I know the Kardashians have done f-cked up shit before and everything, but the thing is, it&#8217;s like, I think the karma got to them when the last situation happened to shorty before the day she gave birth,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Cardi, of course, is citing the last time <a href="/2018/04/tristan-thompson-caught-cheating-on-khloe-kardashian/">Thompson was caught cheating</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Continuing with this theme, Cardi went on&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever karma they deserve, I think they already have it.</p>
<p>&quot;So why do you guys keep wishing that on a woman? Especially a woman that has a daughter? We know how it is when a n&#8212;a fuck up. Y&#8217;all know that your heart shatters in pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Y&#8217;all know it feels like your heart is literally bleeding and you just want to die. You can&#8217;t even escape it when you&#8217;re seeping, you dream about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Preach, Cardi B. Preach!</p>

<p>On a roll, Cardi turned her attention to Kardashian and added:</p>
<p>&quot;She already learned her lesson, something real f-cked up happened before she gave birth, so why do you guys keep enjoying other people&#8217;s pain, other people&#8217;s misery, knowing how much it hurts when a guy that you&#8217;re in love with, especially the father of your child, does something wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>In conclusion?</p>
<p>Cardi called out &quot;all these fake ass woke people&quot; celebrating women and feminism, saying they&#8217;re the same ones &quot;that will be laughing in the comments when another woman is going through some shit.&quot;</p>
<p>We rarely say this, but: Amen, Cardi B!</p>
<p>We feel for you, Keeks. You&#8217;ll get through this.</p>

<p>More like Famous Actress with the Haughy Attitude and Very Successful Lifestyle Website!</p>
<p>So says Amber Rose, at least.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In a surprise bombshell she decided to drop as a guest on a recent episode of Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag&rsquo;s podcast &ldquo;Make Speidi Famous Again,&quot; Rose has come out and said Gwyneth Paltrow slept with Jay-Z.</p>
<p>While Jay-Z was married to Beyonce.</p>
<p>As in, Paltrow is the infamous woman referred to in gossip circles as &quot;<a href="/slideshows/becky-with-the-good-hair-the-complete-list-of-jay-zs-suspected-m/">Becky with the Good Hair</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the moniker Beyonce herself gave her husband&#8217;s mistress in the 2016 track &quot;Sorry,&quot; in which she sang about Jay-Z&#8217;s infidelity and said:</p>
<p><em>He better call Becky with the good hair</em>.</p>
<p>Ever since Beyonce sang these shocking words, the Internet has been obsessed with determine just who the heck came between her marriage to the dishonest rapper.</p>
<p>And Rose says it&#8217;s Paltrow!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I definitely think that Gwyneth Paltrow is &lsquo;Becky with the good hair &hellip; I feel like she&rsquo;s the one who was, like, f&mdash;king Jay-Z,&rdquo; Rose told Montag and Pratt this week.</p>
<p>What is her evidence for the affair?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s a tad bit flimsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were like friends, and then, like, you don&rsquo;t see Gwyneth Paltrow with Beyonc&eacute; anymore,&quot; Rose explained, adding in vague detail:</p>
<p>It just seems like she was the one that was f-cking Jay-Z, and now Gwyneth lost her husband, but like Beyonc&eacute;&rsquo;s still with Jay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(For the record: Paltrow split from husband Chris Martin in 2014 and is now engaged to television producer Brad Falchuk.)</p>

<p>Is that really all you&#8217;ve got, Amber?</p>
<p>That Jay-Z and Beyonce used to be tight with the Iron Man actress and that&#8217;s no longer the case?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s practically more proof out there that <a href="/2016/10/khloe-kardashian-im-oj-simpsons-daughter/">OJ Simpson is Khloe Kardashian&#8217;s dad</a>.</p>
<p>The most popular theory for the mistress in question&rsquo;s identity has been fashion designer <a href="/slideshows/rachel-roy-photos-is-this-really-jay-zs-side-piece/">Rachel Roy</a>, who is also rumored to be the catalyst for Solange Knowles&#8217; 2014 Met Gala elevator fight with Jay-Z.</p>
<p>Awhile ago, Roy shared an Instagram photo with the caption &ldquo;Good hair don&rsquo;t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies, or self truths, always. Live in the light #nodramaqueens.&quot;</p>
<p>She posted this on the same day the &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; was released.</p>
<p>However, Roy then tried to shoot down her self-created chatter, writing online later that same week:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to put the speculation and rumors to rest. My Instagram post was meant to be fun and lighthearted, it was misunderstood as something other than that.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no validity to the idea that the song references me personally. There is no truth to the rumors.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Beyonce and Jay-Z remain together, the parents of three young kids, despite the latter&#8217;s infidelity.</p>
<p>He <a href="/2018/04/jay-z-im-a-better-person-after-cheating-on-beyonce/">opened up about it this year to David Letterman</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have the emotional tools that it takes to keep my family together. And much like you, I have a beautiful wife who&rsquo;s understanding and knew I&rsquo;m not the worst of what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; the rapper told the comedian, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did the hard work of going to therapy and you know, we love each other, right? So we really put in the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;Paltrow&rsquo;s rep tells Us Weekly that this cheating allegation &ldquo;is completely absurd and 100 percent false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you buying it?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Rose now says she was just kidding, writing online:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruh we were joking on a Podcast! I have no information about anyone&rsquo;s Personal life.&rdquo;</p>
