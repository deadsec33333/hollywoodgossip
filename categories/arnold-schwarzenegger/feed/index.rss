<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is hyping up <em>Patrick </em>Schwarzenegger for his eye-catching new TV role.</p>



<p><em>The White Lotus</em> is prestige television. It reminded the world that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ariana-grande-botox-palm-springs-jennifer-coolidge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Coolidge</a> is a national treasure.</p>



<p>Patrick is a Season 3 star. He is following in his famous father&#8217;s footsteps as an actor.</p>



<p>In fact, he seems to be following pretty closely. Like his dad before him, Patrick stripped down on camera.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-patrick-schwarzenegger-stripped-down-on-the-white-lotus-and-arnold-couldn-t-be-prouder">Patrick Schwarzenegger stripped down on &#8216;The White Lotus,&#8217; and Arnold couldn&#8217;t be prouder</h2>



<p>Proud father <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/arnold-schwarzenegger-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> recently attended the Season 3 premiere event for <em>The White Lotus</em> to cheer on his son, Patrick.</p>



<p>He even took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DF8dSMQzuiO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to sing the 31-year-old&#8217;s praises while teasing fans about what the season has in store.</p>



<p>“What a show!” gushed the legendary actor and former governor. “I could claim to be surprised to find out he has a nude scene, but what can I say &#8212; the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”</p>

<script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>



<p>“Don’t miss it this Sunday &#8212; trust me,” Arnold Schwarzenegger then reminded his followers. <em>The White Lotus</em> Season 3 premiere was last night on HBO. And on the poorly-named Max streaming service.</p>



<p>At the same time, Arnold was reminding followers that he&#8217;d engaged in his own nude photoshoot way back in 1970, when he was in his early 20s. The photo was published by<em> Spy Magazine</em> in 1992 as part of a media manipulation story on how the actor&#8217;s management controlled his image.</p>



<p>Remember, this was over 30 years ago. There was an appalling backlash. But Arnold, then one of the most famous actors on the planet, went on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em> to point out that he felt no shame for posing for his art or anything else.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-like-father-like-son">Like father, like son</h2>



<p>In addition to his youthful photo &#8212; which featured full frontal nudity &#8212; Arnold Schwarzenegger also wore little to no clothing for multiple iconic roles.</p>



<p>From wearing next to nothing as Conan to time-traveling naked in <em>Terminator</em> and <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, he felt proud to show off his famous body.</p>



<p>And, now, Arnold Schwarzenegger is clearly feeling proud of Patrick for following in his footsteps. Though, as with many children of any age, his son wouldn&#8217;t mind if he said a little less.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Parents 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/uWnDn2WJQB">https://t.co/uWnDn2WJQB</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Schwarzenegger (@PSchwarzenegger) <a href="https://twitter.com/PSchwarzenegger/status/1889432940452651411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>As reports highlighted Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s comments and him hyping up Patrick&#8217;s nude scene, the <em>The White Lotus</em> star took to Twitter to respond.</p>



<p>&#8220;Parents,&#8221; he <a href="https://x.com/PSchwarzenegger/status/1889432940452651411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, with a pair of facepalming emojis.</p>



<p>His patient embarrassment is endearing and relatable. The tweet is also a reminder that there <em>are </em>downsides to being a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/tori-spelling-marks-90210-anniversary-gets-super-defensive-about-nepo-baby-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nepo baby</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-does-patrick-schwarzenegger-play-on-the-white-lotus-season-3">Who does Patrick Schwarzenegger play on &#8216;The White Lotus&#8217; Season 3?</h2>



<p>On Season 3 of <em>The White Lotus</em>, Patrick Schwarzenegger portrays Saxon Ratliff. He is vacationing with his parents (portrayed by Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey) and two younger siblings.</p>



<p>Fittingly, Patrick&#8217;s Saxon is already working for the family business. One wonders if it is a coincidence, or if some nepo baby typecasting was in play.</p>



<p>Either way, it&#8217;s been an interesting &#8212; and eye-catching &#8212; season. Of course, it&#8217;ll be difficult to top that memorable Season 2 ending.</p>



<p>Regardless of who&#8217;s doing it, it&#8217;s nice to hear that the series will continue to feature nudity. Years and years of anti-sex sentiment has turned so much of television and film into a weird <em>horniness desert</em>. And <em>The White Lotus</em> is doing their part to set things right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>More than any election in history, the race for the White House in 2024 has seen people taking sides &#8211; and not the ones you might thing. </p>



<p>Just days before the Presidential election, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a well known and respected Republican, joined the ranks of the Cheneys and Bushes and endorsed Kamala Harris for President. </p>



<p>The actor and former Governor of California has given speeches at the Republican National Convention. Perhaps more importantly, he ran and won as a Republican during his time heading California&#8217;s executive branch.</p>



<p>However, Schwarzenegger is an outspoken proponent of environmental protections and of securing democracy. He has also been one of disgraced former president <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/arnold-schwarzenegger-destroys-donald-trump-makes-potus-an-offer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump&#8217;s most vocal critics</a>.</p>



<p>Considering that he represents values that are antithetical to the dominant ideology of the GOP and his endorsement of Harris, can Schwarzenegger still really call himself a Republican?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-1024x681.jpg" alt="Arnold Schwarzenegger in April of 2024." class="wp-image-500349" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_arnoldschwarzenegger_01-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks during the 10X Growth Conference 2024 at The Diplomat Beach Resort on April 04, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ivan Apfel/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-will-always-be-an-american-before-i-am-a-republican">&#8220;I Will Always be an American Before I am a Republican&#8221;</h2>



<p>On the Wednesday before the election, Arnold announced he would be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz in a rare endorsement.</p>



<p>The  longtime Republican criticized Donald Trump and said a second term for the former president would make people “angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.”</p>



<p>Arnold has long been a critic of the former Presidents policies, but to go so far as to endorse the Democratic nominee, proves that this race is really above putting policies over politics. </p>



<p>“He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger,” Schwarzenegger said on his post on social media.</p>



<p>The week before, Trump said the US is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/politics/trump-us-garbage-can-immigration/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“like a garbage can for the world”</a> as he railed against illegal immigration at a campaign rally in Arizona.</p>



<p>“To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” Schwarzenegger said <a href="https://x.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1851627802027758005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post on X</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-arnold-schwarzenegger-explains-his-politics">Arnold Schwarzenegger Explains His Politics </h2>



<p>As you can see in the video below, <a href="https://www.nbc.com/meet-the-press/video/schwarzenegger-absolutely-still-feels-at-home-in-gop-i-dont-see-republicans-as-crazies/NBCN644421629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arnold Schwarzenegger spoke to ABC&#8217;s <em>Meet The Press</em></a> in October of 2023 to clarify his political affiliation.</p>



<p>“When I go up to Capitol Hill and I meet with my Republican colleagues, I have a great time meeting with them,&#8221; he described.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Schwarzenegger continued, &#8220;talking about the environment and talking about the important issues.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>“I don’t look at them as kind of crazies like some people do,” Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed of his fellow Republicans.</p>



<p>“There are some that are extreme,&#8221; he freely acknowledged.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Schwarzenegger then added, &#8220;there’s no reason to villainize anybody.&#8221; That is true enough. People who are villains tend to <em>villainize </em>themselves without anyone&#8217;s help.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-does-arnold-schwarzenegger-still-fit-in-with-the-republican-party">But does Arnold Schwarzenegger still &#8216;fit in&#8217; with the Republican Party?</h2>



<p>Despite his 2020 election loss and 2021 attempt to usurp those election results by effectively <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/donald-trump-supporters-storm-us-capitol-attempt-to-overthrow-th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">siccing his most violent followers on Congress</a> to prevent the formal recognition of his defeat, Donald Trump still enjoys widespread support within the Republican Party and is the presumptive nominee for the 2024 election.</p>



<p>Mike Johnson is a climate science-doubter, an election-denier, and a Trump supporter. He is also the Republican Speaker of the House, elected to that position by his peers in Congress.</p>



<p>At present, all across the nation and on every political level, GOP operatives are at work restricting voter rights and generally laying the groundwork to bring about a 2024 Trump victory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a staunch supporter of environmental protections. The radical deregulation agenda pushed by the far right is antithetical to his stances.</p>



<p>In the wake of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Schwarzenegger accurately described Trump as the &#8220;worst president ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also condemned the &#8220;spinelessness&#8221; of members of his own party who were &#8220;complicit&#8221; in the worst attack on America itself since 9/11. <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arnold-schwarzenegger-video-trump-gop-kristallnacht_n_5ffb4263c5b63642b6fccba5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schwarzenegger&#8217;s comments</a> drew very accurate comparisons to escalating Nazi violence from his homeland of Austria.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-arnold-schwarzenegger-still-part-of-the-gop">Why is Arnold Schwarzenegger still part of the GOP?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/steve-harvey-republican-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Political party affiliation</a> is no simple matter. Schwarzenegger clearly feels that there are enough of his values within the Republican Party that he can save it from the radicalization that has taken over it. </p>



<p>And so, he stays. </p>



<p>The GOP that he envisions might not be one that anyone born within the past 40 years would recognize, but there are certainly Republicans who represent conservatism without (overt) white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, or any of the Republican Party&#8217;s other current defining features.</p>



<p>Some may argue that Schwarzenegger is merely a Republican by habit. Many Americans have older relatives who voted for GOP candidates back when airplanes had &#8220;smoking sections&#8221; and never shook the political label, even if they abhor Trump and all that he represents. </p>



<p>Identity can be a difficult thing to unpack and redefine.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the 70-year-old screen icon and former governor of California is currently<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/03/30/arnold-schwarzenegger-open-heart-surgery-valve-replacement/"> recovering at Cedars-Sinai</a> in Los Angeles following a&nbsp;catheter valve replacement that went awry.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sources say doctors were prepared for the possibility that the valve replacement might fail, and they quickly made the decision to perform emergency open heart surgery.</p>
<p>While the second procedure reportedly went as planned, family, friends, and fans are said to be deeply concerned, and understandably so.</p>
<p>Adding to their fear is the fact that this is not the first time Schwarzenegger has undergone heart surgery.</p>
<p>The actor had an aortic valve replaced in 1997.</p>
<p>Doctors reportedly informed Schwarzenegger that the procedure wasn&#8217;t urgently needed at the time, but he decided to get it out of the way while he was still young.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not currently clear if Schwarzenegger&#8217;s recent problems are related to the condition he was treated for back then.</p>
<p>At the time of his first procedure, Schwarzenegger stated that the condition was congenital and not the result of past steroid use.</p>
<p>While this week&#8217;s open heart surgery was an emergency procedure, sources say it went as well as could be expected, given the circumstances.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on when Schwarzenegger will be fully recovered, but those who know him best expect the famously ambitious fitness fanatic to be back on his feet in no time.</p>
<p>Arnold, of course, has been a mainstay in American pop culture and politics for the past four decades.</p>

<p>The Austrian-born former bodybuilder is on the short list of celebrities who are so iconic they can be referred to by a single name.</p>
<p>At 70, he remains as relevant as ever, and <a href="/videos/arnold-schwarzenegger-slams-donald-trump-let-me-be-president-gir/">Schwarzenegger&#8217;s feud with Donald Trump</a> recently made headlines and reminded the world of just what a sharp wit Arnold truly is.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger has yet to issue a statement regarding his latest health scare, but you can bet that one is coming soon.</p>
<p>Arnold famously loves his public as much as the public loves him.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>But times have changed, and now we&#8217;re living in a time in which the actual president of the United States feels the need to log onto Twitter and express his hurt feelings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s strange, it&#8217;s uncomfortable, but here we are.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s feud with Arnold Schwarzenegger started back in September when it was announced that Arnold would <a href="/2015/09/arnold-schwarzenegger-to-take-over-as-celebrity-apprentice-host/">take over Trump&#8217;s position as host of The Apprentice</a>.</p>
<p>Arnold&#8217;s season premiered in January, and there was a big drop in ratings &#8212; 4.9 million viewers compared to 6.8 million viewers that watched Trump&#8217;s last premiere.</p>
<p>At the time, Trump tweeted &quot;Wow, the ratings are in and <a href="/2017/01/donald-trump-to-arnold-schwarzenegger-good-job-terminating-the-c/">Arnold Schwarzenegger got &#8216;swamped&#8217;</a> (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="994" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-994x1024.jpg" alt="Donald Trump at the Lectern" class="wp-image-256093" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-994x1024.jpg 994w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-291x300.jpg 291w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-768x791.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-1492x1536.jpg 1492w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-1989x2048.jpg 1989w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-735x757.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-325x335.jpg 325w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-337x347.jpg 337w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-505x520.jpg 505w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-622x640.jpg 622w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-746x768.jpg 746w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-932x960.jpg 932w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-at-the-lectern-1049x1080.jpg 1049w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Yes, he seriously referred to himself as &quot;the ratings machine.&quot; Feel free to take a break to shake off all that embarrassment.</p>
<p>&quot;So much for being a movie star &#8211; and that was season 1 compared to season 14,&quot; he added. &quot;No compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich and Hillary.&quot;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that Trump would have been too busy with that presidency gig to worry so much about The Apprentice, but you have to realize that he&#8217;s still an executive producer for the show.</p>
<p>(Hold on, it only gets more absurd from here on out.)</p>
<p><a href="/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-fires-back-at-donald-trump-go-do-your-job/">Arnold fired back</a>, telling Trump that he hopes he cares as much about being a good president as he does about ratings. He later criticized Trump for his ridiculous Muslim Ban, and for all the other terrible, terrifying decisions he&#8217;s made in these past two months.</p>

<p>But finally, things got to be too much for Arnold, and <a href="/2017/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-wont-return-to-celebrity-apprentice-due-to/">he decided to step down</a> as the host of The Apprentice.</p>
<p>In a statement, he said that he loved working with the people on the show, and that he would love to continue working with them, but the show simply has too much &quot;baggage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With Trump being involved in the show,&quot; he explained, &quot;people have a bad taste and don&#8217;t want to participate as a spectator or as a sponsor or in any other way support the show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a very divisive period now, and I think this show got caught up in all that division.&quot;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s totally fair &#8212; Arnold doesn&#8217;t want to get mixed up in any Donald Trump production when Donald Trump is very likely the most hated man in all of America right now.</p>

<p>But you know Easy D couldn&#8217;t just let that lie.</p>
<p>Trump got on Twitter this morning and wrote &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger isn&#8217;t voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to a great show.&quot;</p>
<p>So Arnold was fired because the ratings were bad, huh?</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with the fact that since the last season of the show premiered, people have learned <a href="/2016/10/melania-trump-blames-billy-bush-for-husbands-lewd-comments/">so very, very many terrible things about Trump</a> and may have wanted to distance themselves from a production he&#8217;s always been so closely involved with?</p>

<p>Actually,&nbsp;Arnold Schwarzenegger has a few messages for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Just hours after the President-Elect went on one of his typical Twitter storms &#8211; <a href="/2017/01/donald-trump-to-arnold-schwarzenegger-good-job-terminating-the-c/">slamming&nbsp;Schwarzenegger as a has-been</a> due to the poor ratings for this week&#8217;s Celebrity Apprentice premiere &#8211; the ex-movie star has fired back.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="464" height="696" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic.jpg" alt="Arnold Schwarzenegger Promo Pic" class="wp-image-252386" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic.jpg 464w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-promo-pic-427x640.jpg 427w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /><figcaption>(NBC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The NBC reality show returned on Monday night to 4.9 million total viewers, along with a 1.3 rating in the key demographic of adults 18-49.</p>
<p>The previous season premiere, which was hosted by Trump and aired back in January 2015, garnered 6.8 million viewers and earned a 2.4 in this same under age category.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty huge dropoff.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s one The Donald took pointed notice of on social media.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got &lsquo;swamped&rsquo; (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT,&rdquo; Trump tweeted on Friday, morning.</p>
<p>Added the impending President of the United States:</p>
<p>&quot;So much for being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich &amp; Hillary.&quot;</p>
<p>In this case, at least, we have to give Trump credit:</p>
<p>He got his numbers right.</p>
<p><a href="/2017/01/jackie-evancho-album-sales-are-doing-the-opposite-of-what-donald/">This rarely happens when it comes to Trump on Twitter</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="528" height="538" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-as-the-boss.jpg" alt="Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Boss" class="wp-image-252390" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-as-the-boss.jpg 528w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-as-the-boss-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-as-the-boss-329x335.jpg 329w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-as-the-boss-341x347.jpg 341w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/arnold-schwarzenegger-as-the-boss-510x520.jpg 510w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /><figcaption>(NBC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Schwarzenegger, the former Republican Governor of California, has never been one to back down from a fight, however.</p>
<p>So he quickly jumped on social media and took Trump down with a couple piece of advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more important that the people&rsquo;s work, @realDonaldTrump,.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you the best of luck and I hope you&rsquo;ll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.&quot;</p>
<p><em><strong>Damn! Shots fired!</strong></em></p>
<p>And&nbsp;Schwarzenegger wasn&#8217;t finished, either.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Please study this quote from [Abraham] Lincoln&rsquo;s inaugural, @realDonald Trump,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It inspired me every day I was Governor, and I hope it inspires you.&quot;</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger then went ahead and read the quote in a video. This is what it says:</p>
<p><strong>We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</strong></p>
<p>Without doubt, these profound, helpful words will turn Trump around and he&#8217;ll focus entirely on governing the country, sympathizing with all Americans and doing everything he can actually make this country better.</p>
<p>Darn. We almost did it.</p>
<p>We almost wrote that entire paragraph with a straight face.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Trump is an executive producer on The Apprentice.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous, yet it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>It means he actually makes money if you watch the show, which could explain why he&#8217;s so bitter over these terrible ratings.</p>
<p>The guy is clearly in need of money. A lot of money. He may owe Russia hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Expect Vladimir Putin to hack into the NBC ratings database any day now.</p>

<p>If you recall, <a href="/2015/09/arnold-schwarzenegger-to-take-over-as-celebrity-apprentice-host/">Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump</a> on the most recent season of the former NBC hit, but that was not the only change in store. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="730" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-730x1024.jpg" alt="The President-Elect" class="wp-image-251572" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-730x1024.jpg 730w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-768x1077.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-1096x1536.jpg 1096w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-1461x2048.jpg 1461w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-735x1030.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-239x335.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-248x347.jpg 248w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-371x520.jpg 371w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-456x640.jpg 456w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-548x768.jpg 548w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-685x960.jpg 685w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect-770x1080.jpg 770w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/the-president-elect.jpg 1505w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>There was a new receptionist, a location change and even a Terminator inspired catchphrase. It was actually pretty good.</p>
<p>Then again, after being off the air for so long, we were probably just glad to have the show back. </p>
<p>Turns out, considerably less viewers checked the show out with the addition of Schwarzenegger.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The first episode could only muster 4.9 million viewers and a 1.3 rating in the all important 18-49 demographic. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s down from the 6.8 million and 2.4 rating from the premiere of the final Donald Trump fronted season which hit the air in January, 2015. </p>
<p>We can&#8217;t be the only ones who expected some bumper ratings &#8211; at least for the premiere.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s usually a curiosity factor that accompanies casting stunts like this. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/trump-bashes-schwarzeneggers-celebrity-apprentice-ratings-w459354">Trump was quick to trash Arnold&#8217;s appearance</a> after finding out just how terrible the ratings were. </p>
<p>“Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT,” Trump, 70, tweeted on Friday, January 6.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much for being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported [John] Kasich &amp; Hillary [Clinton].&#8221;</p>
<p>We sure hope Trump had FedEX on speed dial to send Arnie some ice for that burn. </p>

<p>Ever since it was announced that the former Governor of California would be taking Donald&#8217;s place on the reality series, Donald has made it clear he wants nothing to do with the show. </p>
<p>When people voiced their pleasure at Trump being ousted from the show, his adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed that Trump would still keep an executive producer credit on the show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>However, Trump later boasted on Twitter about the fact that he would have absolutely nothing to do with the show. </p>
<p>If you want to watch the likes of Nicole Snooki Polizzi, Porsha Williams and Boy George try to prove they have any business savvy, then tune in on Monday nights because it&#8217;s actually pretty fun to watch them realize they do not. </p>

<p>After announcing this summer that Donald Trump would not return as host of Celebrity Apprentice (due to his whole <a href="/videos/donald-trump-what-did-he-actually-say-about-mexicans/">most-Mexicans-are-rapists</a> thing), the network confirmed today&nbsp;Arnold Schwarzenegger will lead the reality show when it returns early next year.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, the same&nbsp;Arnold Schwarzenegger who cheated on his wife; impregnated his housekeeper; nearly ran California into bankruptcy as governor; and who starred in The Last Stand.</p>
<p>&quot;We are thrilled to be opening a powerful new chapter in the story of the Apprentice franchise,&quot; Paul Telegdy, president of alternative and late night programming at NBC Entertainment, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger is the epitome of a global brand in entertainment and business, and his accomplishments in the political arena speak for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;It was Arnold&#8217;s personal passion for the format that Mark Burnett and Donald Trump built over the last decade, as well as his fresh take on how to take it to new heights for today&#8217;s audiences, that made him the man to hire.&quot;</p>
<p>And then, because Telegdy simply could not help himself, he added:</p>
<p>&quot;The Celebrity Apprentice &hellip; will be back!&quot;</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, chimed in himself via statement and added:</p>
<p>&quot;I am thrilled to bring my experience to the boardroom and to continue to raise millions for charity. Let&rsquo;s get started!&quot;</p>
<p>No premiere date has been announced for Celebrity Apprentice, but NBC vows it will be part of its 2016-2017 lineup.</p>

<p>But the Internet is now asking: Is it too late to reboot the movie&#8217;s title?!?</p>
<p>The former California Governor released a photo on Instagram today that reveals the name of the fifth film in this franchise, while also mentioning it in an accompanying caption.</p>

            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>&#8220;Hasta la vista, baby. I want to thank the cast and crew of @TerminatorGenisys for a fantastic shoot,&#8221; Schwarzenegger wrote.</p>
<p>Yes, the movie will apparently be titled <strong><em>Terminator Genisys</em></strong>.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>We can only assume this is a reference to a company in the story and not a tragic misspelling.</p>
<p>It was challenging, it was fun, and it was rewarding,&#8221; Schwarzenegger added. &#8220;From our director to the producers, from the camera team to catering, from visual effects to hair and makeup &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t have done it without you.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to see our finished project and I know we&#8217;ll remind the fans why they fell in love with the Terminator. On July 1, 2015, I&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan Taylor will direct the upcoming blockbuster, which also stars Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, Jason Clarke, J.K. Simmons and Matt Smith.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger, of course, will reprise his iconic role of a machine in the film.</p>

<p>Jimmy Fallon made sure of this on The Tonight Show yesterday, listing the latest version of this Frozen smash as the lowest-rated song on the chart.</p>

<p>In contrastingly awesome Frozen music news, the following parody of &quot;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&quot; is one of the best things to hit the Internet in months.</p>
