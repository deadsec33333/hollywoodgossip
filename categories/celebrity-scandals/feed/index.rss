<p>Karen Huger is headed to the slammer.</p>



<p>Just about two months after The Real Housewives of Potomac <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/karen-huger-charged-with-dui-real-housewives-of-potomac-star-explains-what-happened/">cast member was found guilty</a> on nearly <em>all</em> counts related to her March 2024 DUI arrest&#8230; the Bravo personality was sentenced on Wednesday by a Montgomery County, Maryland judge to two years in prison.</p>



<p>One of these years has been suspended, meaning Huger will be an inmate for only half of the allotted time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="926" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-1024x926.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520188" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-1024x926.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-300x271.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-768x694.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-2048x1852.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-960x868.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-1080x976.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2188941492-1200x1085.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Karen Huger attends The Hollywood Critics Association&#8217;s Astra Creative Arts, Film &amp; TV Awards at Taglyan Complex on December 8, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on local news reports, Huger won&#8217;t be permitted to drive a vehicle for another year after her release and will also face five years of probation.</p>



<p>Citing Karen&#8217;s three previous DUIs (<em><strong>YIKES</strong></em>!), prosecutors initially asked the judge for two years in prison with six months suspended for the reality star&#8217;s latest arrest.</p>



<p>&#8220;You were filled to the gills with alcohol,” the judge in the case told Huger during sentencing.</p>



<p>Fox 5 reported on February 26 that the reality star testified on her own behalf this morning in court, apologizing to the judge and saying that she would attend AA meetings for the rest of her life, as well as offering to become a spokesperson against drunk driving.</p>



<p>As Huger was being taken into custody following the sentencing, she yelled to her husband: “Love you, Ray. God’s got you. You’ll be alrighty. God bless you.”</p>

<p>Karen crashed her Maserati last March near Bethesda, Maryland after she crossed a median and struck rammed into signs. </p>



<p>The 61-year-old was charged with driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol; driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol; negligent driving of a vehicle in a careless and imprudent manner endangering property, life and person; and reckless driving a vehicle in wanton and willful disregard for safety of persons and property and several other related charges.</p>



<p>A Maryland jury found Karen guilty of driving under the influence, negligent driving and failure to control speed to avoid collision on December 18, 2024.</p>

<p>A day after the arrest, Karen issued the following statement to <a href="http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/">celebrity gossip</a> outlet TMZ:</p>



<p><em>Thank you all for your prayers and well wishes during this very frightening experience. I am still in shock from last night&#8217;s incident, but grateful to be alive today. With the passing of my beloved mother, grief comes and goes in waves, and with Mother&#8217;s Day approaching it has felt more like a tsunami.</em></p>



<p><em>I was crying on my way home and saw a car heading right for me. I swerved to avoid the head-on collision, hit the divider and then a tree. I&#8217;m hurt, bruised up a bit, but so grateful I am alive! </em></p>



<p><em>I did receive citations, one of which was unrelated to the incident which is understandable, but what was most surprising is that the car that almost hit me just drove away.</em></p>



<p>Huger becomes one of numerous Real Housewives stars to be sent to prison, joining such law-breakers as Teresa Giudice and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/jen-shah/">Jen Shah</a>.</p>

<p>Jeremy Madix, the brother of former <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/vanderpump-rules/">Vanderpump Rules</a> star Ariana Madix, was arrested at his home in Oceanside, California back on July 10 and extradited to Orange County, Florida.</p>



<p>According to legal documents obtained by various <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/">celebrity gossip</a> outlets, Madix was charged with one count of trafficking in cannabis over 25 pounds stemming from an incident that took place on February 16.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="974" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-1024x974.jpg" alt="Jeremy Madix picture" class="wp-image-507363" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-1024x974.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-300x285.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-768x731.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-2048x1948.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-960x913.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-1080x1027.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1128258578-1200x1141.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jeremy Madix attends the 2019 Pre-GRAMMY event presented by OK!, Star, In Touch and Life &amp; Style magazines at the Liaison Restaurant on February 7, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Paul Archuleta/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The arrest warrant alleges that Jeremy and a friend named Jonah Ahad were traveling together from Orlando International Airport to Frankfurt, Germany when Customs and Border Protection agents inspected two bags belonging to Jeremy and one belonging to Ahad.</p>



<p><strong>In Jeremy’s suitcases, he was <strong>apparently</strong></strong> <strong>carrying 64 vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana, which weighed approximately 76 pounds</strong>. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s just a crazy amount of weed.</p>



<p>Madix was initially held without bail, but a judge eventually set this figure at $80,000 and he has since been released. </p>



<p>The reality star had to surrender his passport within five days of release to the clerk’s office.</p>

<p>Madix faces a minimum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of $25,000.</p>



<p>In the time since his arrest, Jeremy&#8217;s mother, Tanya Madix, has written a letter in support of her son, telling the judge overseeing the case that the 32-year-old is &#8220;is a wonderful loving son&#8221; and a &#8220;kind person.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been no word from sister Ariana, however.</p>



<p>This is because the siblings are not close.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="713" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-713x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-507365" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-713x1024.jpg 713w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-209x300.jpg 209w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-768x1103.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-1426x2048.jpg 1426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-669x960.jpg 669w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-752x1080.jpg 752w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-836x1200.jpg 836w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1409903558-scaled.jpg 1783w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Madix attends DailyMail.com and TMX opening celebration of Schwartz and Sandy&#8217;s on July 19, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for DailyMail.com)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Obviously, I’m always going to stand by my sister,&#8221; Jeremy said in March on the PUMP RULES Podcast , referencing Ariana&#8217;s infamous split from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/tom-sandoval/">Tom Sandoval</a> after his affair with Raquel Leviss. </p>



<p>&#8220;But yeah, I need to talk to Tom. I would love to talk to my sister, but I haven’t heard from her in months.&#8221;</p>



<p>He previously told Us Weekly that the estrangement stems from how Ariana does NOT get along with Jeremy&#8217;s fiance.</p>



<p>“There’s been some small microaggressive gestures toward my fiancée, and that’s what’s led to me not talking to my sister. It’s been going on for quite some time,” he told this tabloid months ago. </p>



<p>“I think that we’ve just been kind of letting it pass, because of course I’m always going to have my sister’s back. But I was put in a position where I choose my sister, or do I choose the person I’m going to spend the rest of my life with?”</p>

<p>A former contestant on The Bachelorette is in trouble with the law.</p>



<p><em>Again</em>.</p>



<p>According to Page Six, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/05/entertainment/bachelorette-alum-james-mccoy-taylor-arrested-for-assault/">James McCoy Taylor was arrested</a> Sunday and booked on two charges: assault causing bodily injury and unlawful restraint.</p>



<p>He has since been released on $8,000 bond.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="432" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/142914_4402-768x432-1.webp" alt="James Taylor as a contestant on The Bachelorette." class="wp-image-506362" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/142914_4402-768x432-1.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/142914_4402-768x432-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/142914_4402-768x432-1-728x410.webp 728w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Taylor as a contestant on The Bachelorette.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>College Station Police Department’s public information officer told The New York Post today that Taylor was handcuffed and hauled away from at a bar in the Northgate entertainment district of Brazos County, Texas.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t have any further information on exactly what transpired&#8230; but the charges are actually related to some sort of incident from April 24, jail records state.</p>



<p>Taylor, who is smiling broadly in his mug shot, denied any wrongdoing when contacted this morning by Page Six. </p>



<p>However, he has not issued a public statement at this time.</p>

<p>Taylor was a suitor back on JoJo Fletcher&#8217;s season of The Bachelorette, which aired in 2016.</p>



<p>In September 2022, Taylor was arrested for driving while intoxicated and unlawful carrying of a weapon. A month later, a Brazos County judge found Taylor guilty on both charges. </p>



<p>He was sentenced to serve five days, pay a $500 fine and $585 in court costs &#8212; and there was a temporary suspension of his drivers license.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, this same alleged law-breaker participated in the insurrection on the Capitol in Washington, D.C., to protest former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss back on January 6, 2021.</p>



<p>“Big thanks to #TheBachelor family for supporting me during this time … from top to bottom,” he wrote via Twitter shortly after this riot went down. </p>



<p>“Conservative producers are the best!! Thank you @ABCNetwork @ABC &amp; @BachelorABC for having my back while I legally supported our President.”</p>



<p>Of course, this wasn&#8217;t exactly the case. </p>

<p>The Bachelorette creator, Mike Fleiss, publicly kicked Taylor out of Bachelor Nation in 2021 after he supported the attempted coup.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoever that former cast member/idiot jerkoff is that went to Trump’s treasonous rally, got a message for ya… You are officially exiled from #BachelorNation !!!&#8221; wrote Fleiss back then, later adding:</p>



<p><strong>Thanks all for letting me know. @JamesTaylor_com shame on you.</strong></p>

<p>Ariana Grande is a divorced woman, something she hoped she&#8217;d never be, but it happened all the same. </p>



<p>Her romantic life has been a hot topic of conversation ever since she was crowned a pop princess. Despite transition into a mature, eloquent artist, many are still fixated just on the goings on of her love life.</p>



<p>That scrutiny is about to intensify as we inch closer to the release of <em>Wicked</em> in theaters. </p>



<p>In the movie, there&#8217;s debate over if her character is a good witch or a bad witch; that same conversation is also happening in her real life. </p>



<p>So, to review, let&#8217;s see how Ariana added &#8220;divorcee&#8221; to her resume. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-grande-s-divorce-what-happened-with-dalton-gomez">Ariana Grande&#8217;s Divorce: What Happened With Dalton Gomez?</h2>



<p>The world learned of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ariana-grande-splits-from-dalton-gomez-the-marriage-is-over/">Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez&#8217;s split</a> in the summer of 2023</p>



<p>Their surprise marriage turned into an equally out-of-the-blue breakup, following a very <em>quiet </em>separation.</p>



<p>So quiet, in fact, that Dalton was able to date for months without the world catching wind that Ariana was &#8220;single&#8221;. (Note the quotations.)</p>



<p>But what caused the end of their marriage? The answer is &#8230; complicated.</p>



<p>At first, multiple inside sources <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/17/ariana-grande-dalton-gomez-divorce-split-breakup-covid/">reported to <em>TMZ</em></a> that Ariana and Dalton&#8217;s marriage fell apart because they&#8217;re lives no longer meshed.</p>



<p>When the two of them first hooked up back in 2020, in the middle of a global pandemic they were pretty much each other&#8217;s whole worlds.</p>



<p>They kept each other company. They shared romance. And they provided each other with emotional support.</p>



<p>But after the life-saving COVID-19 restrictions lifted, Ariana and Dalton got back to their respective careers; Dalton, a successful Los Angeles realtor and Ariana, a global superstar. And that&#8217;s where the trouble started.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-grande-s-surprise-relationship-with-wicked-co-star-ethan-slater">Ariana Grande&#8217;s Surprise Relationship With &#8216;Wicked&#8217; Co-star Ethan Slater</h2>



<p>Ariana started filming the movie adaptation of the Broadway musical <em>Wicked</em> in December 2022 in London. This was the beginning of the end of her long distance marriage. </p>



<p>Within a month of her leaving, the pair separated, though no one but their inner circle was aware of this. </p>



<p>By the time fans noticed she was not wearing her wedding ring while attending Wimbledon, her marriage was officially over &#8211; and Ariana was moving on. </p>



<p>Within a few weeks of her divorce announcement, it&#8217;s revealed that Ariana has been dating her still-married-yet-separated <em>Wicked</em> co-star, Ethan Slater. </p>



<p>The news suprised many &#8211; including Ethan&#8217;s wife, Lilly. A source told <em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/07/21/ethan-slaters-wife-blindsided-by-ariana-grande-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a></em> that Lilly was “completely blindsided” by news of Ariana and Ethan dating, adding, “It’s horrible. They were high school sweethearts. They have a baby! She’s a wreck.”</p>



<p>Still, sources who spoke to  <em><a href="https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-dating-ethan-slater-everything-to-know-about-the-broadway-star-and-new-dad-208384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> </em>insisted that the Ariana and Ethan &#8220;didn’t start dating until both were broken up with their significant others.”</p>



<p>Yes, but &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;divorced&#8221; are two separate things. </p>

<p>As she&#8217;s only been married the one time to Dalton Gomez, she&#8217;s only been divorced the one time as well.</p>



<p>Ariana was the one to file for the divorce, citing&nbsp;irreconcilable differences&nbsp;as the reason for the split.</p>



<p>When all was said and done, Ariana onetime payment of $1,250,000 to Gomez with no future alimony, give him half of the proceeds of the sale of their Los Angeles home, and will pay up to $25,000 toward his attorneys’ fees.</p>



<p>Of course, it might&#8217;ve been two divorces, if she had made it down the aisle with Pete Davidson. The pair were engaged, but called it off before they could make it down the aisle in 2018. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-s-love-life-today-is-she-still-with-ethan">Ariana&#8217;s Love Life Today: Is She Still With Ethan?</h2>



<p>As of July 2024, Ariana and Ethan are still going strong, though his own divorce is still not finalized. </p>



<p>The pair were most recently spotted at Game One of the 2024 Stanley Cup Final (photo above), but soon, they&#8217;ll be on the intense press trail together promoting <em>Wicked</em>, which opens November 22, 2024. </p>



<p>In early 2024, Ari dropped her latest album, <em>eternal sunshine</em>, which several tracks alluding her to her rocky divorce and new romance. Though there are reports of her stepping out on Dalton, her lyrics suggest he wasn&#8217;t innocent either. </p>



<p>Ariana made an appearance on the <em>Zach Sang Show</em> at the time of the release to discuss her new album and alludes to her situationship with Ethan when talking about all of the public speculation re: their romance.</p>



<p>“We selectively remember that this is what the tabloids do to people, especially women, based on whether or not we like the person,” Ariana explains. </p>



<p>“We selectively remember that. And we selectively leave space for humanness, for nuance. Like, they don’t leave space for that—well, they do for their friends and their family. It’s selective. But they turn it off when that aligns with the version of a person that they have in their head that they want to believe is true.”</p>

<p>You may not believe this, but Chris Brown has once again been accused of acting in a violent manner.</p>



<p>According to a lawsuit filed on July 21, Brown and members of his entourage “brutally and severely beat” up four individuals &#8212; Larry Parker, Joseph Lewis, Charles Bush and Damarcus Powell &#8212; in what was described in the document as an unprovoked attack backstage at a concert at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>



<p>The incident took place on July 19.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="716" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1024x716.jpg" alt="Chris Brown in Ireland" class="wp-image-504582" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1024x716.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-768x537.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-2048x1433.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-960x672.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1080x756.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1200x840.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Brown performs as part of his &#8220;Under The Influence&#8221; Europe Tour at The 3Arena Dublin on February 11, 2023 in Dublin, Ireland. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Charles McQuillan/Getty Images for Live Nation UK)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is what reportedly transpired:</p>



<p>The four men cited above were invited backstage after to meet Brown after the artist had finished his latest performance; Brown showed up 30 minutes later than anticipated for this meet-up.</p>



<p>At one point, Bush approached Brown to congratulate him on the show&#8230; prompting a member of the singer’s entourage to remind Brown that the two previously had issues. </p>



<p>Brown allegedly said to Bush, “Oh yeah, we were. What’s up, n—a? I don’t forget shit.” </p>



<p>The lawsuit states that Brown and seven to 10 members of his group proceeded to assault Bush and punch him in the chest&#8230; it also says that someone picked up a chair and hurled it at Bush’s head.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Brown told one of his accomplices, Markies Deandre Conway (a.k.a. Yella Beezy), and others to “f-ck” Parker up, leaving him horribly beaten. </p>



<p>The lawsuit claims Parker became trapped in a stairwell where he was then attacked by Brown.</p>



<p>“Upon instruction by Brown, Parker was then punched in the face and chest, kicked in the head for over ten minutes, and stomped on by Defendant Brown and his associates,” the lawsuit alleges. </p>



<p>“Brown encouraged his companions to join in the assault simultaneously. </p>



<p>&#8220;Brown and his entourage then continued to beat Plaintiff Parker closed fisted for almost minutes, repeatedly stomping on Defendant Parker’s head, kicking his face and ribs, and causing severe bodily injury.”</p>

<p>The plaintiffs (one of whom says he needed &#8220;extensive medical treatment&#8221;) are asking the court for compensatory and punitive damages “in excess [of] $50 million,” in addition to actual damages that include “pecuniary losses, pain and suffering, disfigurement, mental anguish, and past, present, and future medical expenses.&#8221;</p>



<p>The lawsuit also claims that Live Nation has continued its relationship with Brown despite his history of “bad conduct and violent conduct&#8221; and “shamelessly profits and promotes Brown’s The 11:11 Tour and brought Brown to Texas for financial gain.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2009, of course, Chris Brown pleaded guilty to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/chris-brown-to-rihanna-congrats-on-becoming-a-mom-do-you-still-h/">assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna</a> &#8212; and three years later was involved in an altercation with Drake at a New York City club. </p>



<p>The artist&#8217;s former manager sued him for assault and battery in 2016.</p>



<p>A year later ex-girlfriend Karreuche Tran got a five-year restraining order against him over alleged threats.</p>



<p>In 2022, Brown was sued for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/chris-brown-sued-for-alleged-drugging-rape-evil-artist-denies-al/">allegedly drugging and raping a woman</a> on board a yacht two years earlier.</p>

<p>We have an update on the very ugly situation surrounding Christine Quinn and her estranged husband, Christian Dumontet.</p>



<p>As previously reported, the former Selling Sunset star is in the middle of what appears to be an unfortunate split from her spouse.</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinn-husband-arrest-domestic-violence-selling-sunset/">Dumontet was arrested for an alleged assault</a> against Quinn, which resulted in the couple&#8217;s three-year old son getting sent to the hospital after he reportedly threw a bag full of glass at his wife &#8212; and it hit the toddler instead.</p>



<p>Dumontet was then arrested for a second time after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christine-quinns-husband-arrested-for-second-time-this-week/">violating a restraining order Quinn had been granted</a> against him.</p>

<p>According to legal documents obtained by TMZ, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/27/selling-sunset-christine-quinn-files-restraining-order-husband-domestic-violence/#continued">Quinn alleges that Dumontet turned violent</a> after she tried to talk to him about the pair&#8217;s financial woes.</p>



<p>Per this TMZ article, Christine &#8220;started throwing a &#8220;bunch of decorative items at her &#8212; some of which had metal rods in them&#8221; during a dispute last week.</p>



<p>He also pulled out his penis and urinated in front of her, she says.</p>



<p>As part of this outburst, Quinn claims Dumontet hurled dog feces in her direction.</p>

<p>After things calmed down between the spouses, Quinn outlines in these papers how she made plans to leave her husband for good.</p>



<p>On March 19, however, Dumontet stormed in, saw his wife packing her things up and flipped the heck out.</p>



<p>This is when, she claims, Dumontet picked up a bag that contained glass and accidentally struck his young child with it in an attempt to assault his wife.</p>



<p>(For his part, Dumontet has denied this allegation.)</p>

<p>According to the former Selling Sunset cast member (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/christine-quinn-is-officially-done-with-selling-sunset/">Quinn left this popular Netflix series</a> in 2022), she fled the room with her son and called 911 at the time &#8230; which ultimately led to Christian&#8217;s arrest for assault with a deadly weapon. </p>



<p>Since then, Christine says she&#8217;s been staying at a hotel. </p>



<p>But she is still very scared for her well-being.</p>



<p>She cites mental health struggles and her husband&#8217;s controlling nature in these documents, as well.</p>

<p>Previously, TMZ reported that Dumontet himself filed for a restraining order against Christine, claiming her dogs relieve themselves all over the house, hence the true basis for their recent blowout.</p>



<p>He denies throwing a bag of glass at her or their son … and says Christine is simply trying to manufacture domestic violent claims against him to get an upper hand in an inevitable divorce.</p>



<p>This request for a protective order has been denied by a judge, though.</p>



<p>Quinn, meanwhile, is demanding sole physical/legal custody of her son until her and Dumontet&#8217;s issues can be settled in court.</p>

<p>TMZ reports that the 60-year old is also facing charges of negligently driving a vehicle in a careless and imprudent manner endangering property, life, and person&#8230;. as well as recklessly driving a vehicle in wanton and willful disregard for the safety of persons and property.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not all, either.</p>



<p>Huger has <em>also</em> been charged with: </p>



<p>Failure to control vehicle speed on the highway to avoid a collision&#8230; driving a vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on the highway&#8230; driving a vehicle on the highway with suspended registration&#8230; and failure to notify administration of change of address within 30 days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you all for your prayers and well wishes during this very frightening experience,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am still in shock from last night&#8217;s incident, but grateful to be alive today. With the passing of my Beloved Mother, Grief comes and goes in waves, and with Mother&#8217;s Day approaching it has felt more like a tsunami.</p>



<p>Huger &#8212; whose parents died within seven months of each other in 2017 &#8212; continued on Wednesday </p>



<p>&#8220;Last night I met a girlfriend for dinner, we talked and brought up some very emotionally sensitive topics. I was crying on my way home and saw a car heading right for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I swerved to avoid the head-on collision, hit the divider, and then a tree. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hurt, bruised up a bit, but so grateful I am alive! I did receive citations, one of which was unrelated to the incident which is understandable, but what was most surprising is that the car that almost hit me just drove away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Huger wrapped up by reminding everyone out there to &#8220;understate your emotional state&#8221;  getting behind the wheel.</p>

<p><em>Update 3/11, 9:15am EST:</em> The Princess of Wales apologized early Monday for releasing a faked family photo of her and her children.</p>



<p>After several news outlets pulled the photo for being &#8216;doctored&#8217; Kate Middleton tweeted her apologies, making her first statement directly to the public since her surgery.</p>



<p>Confessing to an amateur editing fail, she admitted she felt the need to clarify after leading photo agencies — including Reuters, Getty, and AFP — all pulled the image over numerous signs it had been altered.</p>



<p>“Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,” the princess wrote on <em><a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1767135566645092616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter/X</a></em>. “I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused.”</p>



<p>The photo is still live on her social media channels (see below).</p>

<p></p>



<p>Several hours later, <em>Metro UK </em>published <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/03/11/kate-middleton-spotted-leaving-windsor-castle-prince-william-20442653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new photo of Kate</a> leaving Windsor Castle with Prince William, in what is now being touted the first, REAL photo of Kate since her surgery. </p>



<p><strong>Original story</strong>: As you may have heard about, Kate Middleton and The Royal Family <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/surprise-kate-middleton-shares-new-photo-with-kids-amid-wild-conspiracy-claims-about-her-condition/">released a new photo of the princess</a> on Sunday in honor of Mother&#8217;s Day in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>It was unveiled on Middleton and Prince William&#8217;s official Instagram page and it featured Kate sitting on a chair and cuddling up to her three kids:</p>



<p>Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, however&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230; <strong>IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN HEAVILY EDITED</strong>.</p>



<p>The photo, in our estimation, was meant to quell speculation over Middleton&#8217;s health status, as Kensington Palace released the image amid rumors that the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/where-is-kate-middleton-recovery-update/">Princess underwent some sort of serious surgery</a> in January.</p>



<p>This same palace has tried to downplay the procedure, although it also confirmed at the time that Kate would be sidelined from official duties until some time in April.</p>



<p>Since an initial statement released by the Royals on January 17&#8230; Middleton has only been seen once in public and there&#8217;s even been talk of Middleton having been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/kate-middleton-in-a-coma-the-royal-family-responds-to-scary-rumor/">placed in a medically-induced coma</a>.</p>



<p>Enter the photo below&#8230; <strong>and now enter a brand new controversy.</strong></p>

<p>After this seemingly sweet photo was shared with the public on social media, news agencies across the globe &#8212; including the Associated Press, Getty Images, Reuters and the AFP &#8212; actually removed the snapshot from their press libraries, <strong>citing concerns about manipulation</strong>.</p>



<p>The AP reported that it retracted the image &#8220;because at closer inspection, it appeared the source had manipulated the image in a way that did not meet AP&#8217;s photo standards. </p>



<p>&#8220;The photo shows an inconsistency in the alignment of Princess Charlotte&#8217;s left hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be clear, this is a VERY big deal.</p>



<p>This almost never happens, numerous reputable news organizations taking down a picture and outwardly stating they believe it to have been doctored.</p>

<p>Many online commenters noted blurring around one of Charlotte&#8217;s sleeves, while others pointed out what seemed to be edits around the children&#8217;s hair and hands.</p>



<p>Agence France-Presse, meanwhile, said it had withdrawn the photo due to “an editorial issue,&#8221; adding on Sunday:</p>



<p>“It has come to light that this handout photo… issued by Kensington Palace today of the Princess of Wales and her kids had been altered and therefore it was withdrawn from AFP systems.”</p>



<p>A majority of photo agencies and news organizations have strict rules against publishing images that have been overly edited or manipulated. </p>



<p>Reuters, for example, says it only allows the use of Photoshop in “very limited” ways such as cropping or resizing images, or balancing their color</p>



<p><em>Early on Monday, Prince William, who is credited with taking the photo, wrote on Twitter:</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Kate Middleton remained at a London hospital for 12 days after her surgery. </p>



<p>She returned home on January 29 after the palace simply said her procedure was &#8220;not cancerous&#8221; in nature.</p>



<p>The princess has been recuperating primarily at Adelaide Cottage in the many weeks since, while a follow-up message last month from The Royal Family read as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the princess&#8217; recovery and we&#8217;d only be providing significant updates. That guidance stands.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/prince-william-breaks-silence-slams-conspiracy-theories-about-kate-middletons-health/">Prince William responded to conspiracies</a> over his wife&#8217;s health &#8212; but we have some bad news for him:</p>



<p>Things are only gonna get worse now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother&#8217;s Day,&#8221; read the caption from the Middleton on Sunday.</p>



<p>But no one is paying attention to those words now.</p>



<p>They are simply focused on the image affiliated with it, which remains live on Kate and William&#8217;s Instagram page and which is raising far more questions than answers at the moment.</p>

<p>Austin North has broken his silence.</p>



<p>On February 13, the Outer Banks star was arrested for gross misdemeanor battery after allegedly attacking employees at a Las Vegas hospital&#8230; according to a police report obtained by TMZ this week.</p>



<p>Officers were dispatched to the scene on Tuesday where they spoke to the supposed victims after reports of this assault and battery.</p>



<p>North &#8212; who had to be restrained at the time by security guards &#8212; reportedly punched a nurse in the head; shoved the face of another nurse and pushed a third staffer into a table.</p>

<p><strong><em>YIKES</em></strong>, right?!?</p>



<p>In a statement on his Instagram Story Thursday, North addressed the incident, telling followers: </p>



<p>&#8220;I am deeply upset by the events that took place in Las Vegas this past week. </p>



<p>&#8220;My friend drove me to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. Several tests were taken, including blood, which came back negative for any drugs or alcohol in my system. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was having a severe anxiety attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>North went on as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have very little memory of the events that day at the hospital. I have the utmost respect for healthcare workers and hospital staff.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have battled anxiety on and off for years and this was the most extreme panic attack I&#8217;ve ever had. </p>



<p>&#8220;Going forward, I hope to shed light on this debilitating disorder and send hope to those who have also struggled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ryan Edwards appears to once again be in trouble with the law.</p>



<p>According to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/02/12/exclusive/">Mackenzie Edwards called the police</a> on her ex-husband back on January 31 because he allegedly threatened her via text message.</p>



<p>The 911 call was placed around 8:30 p.m. on this date.</p>



<p>Based on an official incident report (obtained by the aforementioned website), Mackenzie told the cops that she wanted them to be aware that Ryan was headed to her house to grab a computer cord&#8230; but she wanted the authorities aware “in case anything happened.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer don&#8217;t look happy in this throwback photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A local deputy was dispatched to the scene in order to meet Ryan there. </p>



<p>After he was apparently unable to locate the item that inspired his visit, the former Teen Mom participant said he&#8217;d come back another day and look for it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the home Ryan stopped by here was the same one <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ryan-edwards-destroys-wifes-home-scrawls-death-threats-all-over-the-walls/">he trashed in February 2023</a>.</p>



<p>During that incident, Edwards scrawled VERY disturbing messages on the walls of his ex-spouse&#8217;s residence, including one that read:</p>



<p>“You slutting around is why this house felt cold and alone. I just could not stand you.”</p>



<p>On January 31 of this year, meanwhile, Mackenzie claims Ryan sent her <em>more</em> threatening messages after he left her home empty-handed.</p>

<p>“Shortly after Ryan and I left the residence, Mackenzie called back in advising Ryan texted her threatening messages,” the aforementioned deputy wrote in his police report. </p>



<p>“Mackenzie advised Ryan sent her a message stating, ‘You’re going to be hard-pressed to find another place to live and no one is going to survive anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mackenzie also told the cops that her former husband allegedly vowed to return to the home the next day to “retrieve his weapons,&#8221; explaining in further detail, per this same report:</p>



<p>&#8220;The only weapon in the house is her personal every day carry pistol. Mackenzie stated that she was going to bring the pistol with her to work just in case Ryan comes to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ryan Edwards has been in and out of both jail and rehab on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>He was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/ryan-edwards-arrested-again-handcuffed-in-court-this-time-around/">most recently arrested in December</a> and is scheduled to go in front of a judge on April 23 to talk about his probation &#8212; which stems from a charge of harassment against Mackenzie last year.</p>



<p>Mackenzie, who filed a restraining order against Ryan in February of last year, told police in this case that she is “scared Ryan could harm her.”</p>

<p>In December, following his latest arrest, Ryan was ordered by Judge Gary Starnes to follow a strict set of rules.</p>



<p>For example, he is required to take monthly Vivitrol shots, which is a prescription injectable medicine designed to help curb alcohol and/or opioid dependence.</p>



<p>He was also ordered back then to attend counseling sessions and agree to random drug tests.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear at this time whether the new accusations will impact Ryan&#8217;s probation in any way.</p>
