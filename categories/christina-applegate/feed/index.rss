<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christina-applegate-gets-candid-about-ms-says-she-wears-a-diaper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Applegate&#8217;s life changed forever </a>when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</p>



<p>The beloved actress has been extremely candid in her discussions of her condition, and many chronic illness patients have drawn inspiration from her example.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/christina-applegate-ms-health-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina still attends events like the Emmys</a>, and she remains as active as her condition allows.</p>



<p>But sadly, she now says that her illness has advanced to the point where she&#8217;s not able to do quite as much as she used to.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christina-appleagate-opens-up-about-the-state-of-her-health">Christina Appleagate opens up about the state of her health</h2>



<p>Appearing on Hoda Kotb&#8217;s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/christina-applegate-and-jamie-lynn-sigler-on-the/id1585499926?i=1000702839344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Making Space&#8221; podcast</a> this week, Applegate gave a heartbreaking update on her battle with MS.</p>



<p>“I am defined by it right now,” Christina told Hoda during a discussion about her illness, adding:</p>



<p>“I have days where I can’t even walk to the bathroom, so I am defined by it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Christina explained that even after four years of fighting this illness, there are days when it just doesn&#8217;t seem real to her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christina-says-her-condition-is-getting-worse">Christina says her condition is &#8216;getting worse&#8217;</h2>



<p>“I’m angry at it still, and there’s a lot of us out there who are newly diagnosed that are not quite ready to accept this reality,” she told Hoda. </p>



<p>“I keep thinking that I’m just going to wake up from this nightmare, and it’s just going to be over,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>“I want to do these things and I can’t, and it feels like I’m getting worse. And that’s disheartening. But then there’s like this voice inside of me that is like, ‘You’ve got to believe in a miracle. You’ve got to believe in another side of this.’”</p>



<p>Christina also hosts a podcast with former <em>Sopranos</em> star Jamie Lynn Sigler who has been battling MS for 23 years.</p>

<p>During a recent conversation, Jamie Lynn made similar remarks about her long battle with this terrible illness.</p>



<p>“Of course, I would love to not struggle in my body,” she said. </p>



<p>“I would love to not have a disability. I would love to be able to participate in my life the way I would choose to, but the way that I look at the world, and the way that I feel about people, I don’t know if it would be the same without this.”</p>



<p>Sigler has been battling MS since she was 20, and her public remarks offer the perspective of someone who can scarcely recall a time when the disease was not a part of their world.</p>



<p>Applegate, of course, is much newer to the experience, and it seems that her feelings are much more raw as a result.</p>



<p>But she&#8217;s already helped countless listeners with her wise but sardonic commentary on the challenges of chronic illness &#8212; and we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;ll continue to do so for many years to come.</p>

<p>Christina Applegate revealed her MS diagnosis in 2021.</p>



<p>She has since opened up, using her platform <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christina-applegate-gets-candid-about-ms-says-she-wears-a-diaper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to get real</a> about the devastating autoimmune disease. </p>



<p>Before her diagnosis, however, there were warning signs.</p>



<p>But she missed those signs while filming. The grueling hours that go into making television made her symptoms look like routine exhaustion &#8212; at first.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="687" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-1024x687.jpg" alt="Christina Applegate tears up in November 2022." class="wp-image-515107" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-768x516.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-2048x1375.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-960x644.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-1080x725.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1212_christinaapplegate_01-1200x806.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Christina Applegate speaks during her Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony at the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California, on November 14, 2022. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christina-applegate-missed-early-warning-signs">Christina Applegate missed early warning signs </h2>



<p>Speaking on the Wednesday, December 11 edition of <a href="https://www.messythepodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>MeSsy </em>podcast</a>, Christina Applegate told co-host Jamie-Lynn Sigler and guest Liz Feldman about how her fall on the set of the latter&#8217;s <em>Dead To Me</em> should have been a wakeup call.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember falling that day,&#8221; the actress said, recalling it happening as she was filming a running sequence in a field.</p>



<p>In retrospect, Applegate understands: &#8220;Hi, first sign of MS! So, not to bring everybody down, but there it was.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Putting Life on Paper with Liz Feldman" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lwg6WKKAnEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>In August of 2021, Christina Applegate revealed that she was suffering from Multiple Sclerosis (MS).</p>



<p>Sigler revealed her own MS battle years earlier, in January of 2016. Thus, their shared podcast.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Feldman is the creator of <em>Dead To Me</em>. That three-season Netflix series (yes, Netflix used to give <em>three whole seasons</em> to shows) was where Applegate began experiencing physical symptoms. But not, as they both initially assumed, because of the series itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-wasn-t-the-late-hours-it-was-ms">It wasn&#8217;t the late hours &#8212; it was MS</h2>



<p>&#8220;I remember you losing your balance when we were shooting the pilot a couple of times,&#8221; Feldman told Applegate.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was very hard to figure it out,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;because, you know, I remember one time, it was really late at night.&#8221;</p>



<p>Feldman detailed: &#8220;We&#8217;d been shooting probably 14 or 15 hours … it seemed completely reasonable that anybody would be collapsing.&#8221; Yes, filming &#8212; especially for television &#8212; can involve truly brutal hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was MS,&#8221; Christina Applegate then acknowledged. Even so, she continued working on the Netflix series through the third season &#8212; by which time she had received her diagnosis.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could just sense A, that she was scared, and B, that something was wrong … that something in her body was not working the way that she wanted it to,&#8221; Feldman described. As the series creator, she was unsure of what to do.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no handbook for this,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I can&#8217;t compare it to any experience I&#8217;ve ever gone through with a person before.&#8221; So, she &#8220;just always tried to put [Christina Applegate&#8217;s] health first in my mind&#8221; as they filmed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-netflix-series-was-not-as-important-as-christina-applegate-and-her-health">The Netflix series was not as important as Christina Applegate and her health</h2>



<p>Applegate praised how Feldman and the show&#8217;s crew went above and beyond to accommodate her. At one point, production halted for a week while she recovered.</p>



<p>&#8220;That would not happen anywhere else, so my gratitude towards you guys being humans &#8211; because you should be humans and love other humans &#8211; is astounding,&#8221; Applegate expressed.</p>



<p>She concluded: &#8220;I can&#8217;t even tell you … that&#8217;s not the normal reaction.&#8221; But it really should be.</p>

<p>Christina Applegate is keeping it real in a new interview.</p>



<p>And, unfortunately for the veteran actress, it&#8217;s really pretty awful these days.</p>



<p>In a joint interview with People Magazine for its new issue, Applegate sits down with Jamie-Lynn Sigler, who, like Applegate, has been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).</p>



<p>What are some of the challenges that come with this chronic disease of the central nervous system?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="893" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-1024x893.jpg" alt="Christina Applegate at the Emmys" class="wp-image-495653" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-1024x893.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-300x261.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-768x669.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-1536x1339.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-2048x1785.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-735x641.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-335x292.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-347x302.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-520x453.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-640x558.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-960x837.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1936134308-1080x941.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christina Applegate speaks speaks onstage during the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater on January 15, 2024 in Los Angeles.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Christina Applegate)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Well, you pee … in your pants,” <a href="https://people.com/christina-applegate-jamie-lynn-sigler-are-helping-each-other-through-ms-exclusive-8608251">Applegate tells the outlet</a>. “Because you probably can’t get to the bathroom in time. So yeah, diapers.”</p>



<p>Applegate &#8212; who was diagnosed with MS in 2021, but who believes she actually had the disease years prior &#8212; even pulled down the waistband of her jeans during this interview to reveal she was wearing a diaper adorned with a floral design.</p>



<p>God bless her candor, right?</p>



<p>Applegate and Sigler are featured on the latest People cover, which marks Applegate&#8217;s first photo shoot in four years.</p>

<p>“The last five days I’ve been sobbing, going, ‘I’m going to have to cancel.’ I was throwing up last night, thinking about all of it,&#8221; Applegate told the magazie. </p>



<p>&#8220;Being touched, makeup and hair, even talking about it, I get spasms. </p>



<p>&#8220;Weird positions, shoes, people, noise, climate I can’t control. It all goes through my mind, and I want to go back to bed and watch <em>Naked and Afraid</em>.”</p>



<p>To her immense credit, however, Applegate (and Sigler) made many jokes during the Q&amp;A about all the positives that come along with MS.</p>

<p>“First of all, parking is awesome,” Applegate quips, to which Sigler agrees as follows: </p>



<p>“There could be a cure for MS, and I will not give up my handicap placard. We earned it!”</p>



<p>Applegate also said that having “wheelchair seating,” getting to board airplanes early and being pushed around airports is “awesome.”</p>



<p>Applegate admits her battle is &#8220;sh-tty,” but remains grateful that she doesn&#8217;t need to go through it alone.</p>

<p>“She’s the only person who really knows me,” Applegate said of Sigler. </p>



<p>“I can talk about anything with her. Constipation, diarrhea … Bravo TV.”</p>



<p>What brave souls.</p>



<p>We continue to send our very best wishes to Christina Applegate and Jamie-Lynn Sigler.</p>

<p>So we suppose it&#8217;s not too surprising that David Faustino is the only one really talking about the long-rumored Married With Children spinoff, but he says it&#8217;s almost certainly happening.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Sony has it. They&rsquo;re excited about it.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re working out some legal issues that we hope they work out,&rdquo; Faustino said in a recent interview with E! News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole cast, including Christina, is down to do little bits in it.&nbsp;The idea would be a pilot for a spin-off. That&rsquo;s all I can say right now. It involves me and few other people.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great news for both the pint-sized frequent Entourage guest star and fans of the raunchy old-school Fox&nbsp;sitcom, alike.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/07/john-stamos-shares-first-photos-from-fuller-house-set-continues/">Fuller House</a> and <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/08/girl-meets-world-renewed-for-season-2/">Girl Meets World</a> both got green lit thanks in part to the wave of 90s nostalgia that&#8217;s currently sweeping the Internet.</p>
<p>The news about Married is a bit more surprising, however, as aside from Bud &quot;Grandmaster B&quot; Bundy, the cast is all doing very well for themselves.</p>
<p>So why would they take time away from their busy schedules to return to the roles that helped make them famous?</p>
<p>Well, you know how celebrities love charity work:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us have said we would all be there for [Faustino],&rdquo; Applegate said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>We think that just about&nbsp;says it all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 50-year old Oscar winner said herself that the honor is patently &quot;ridiculous,&quot; but we can think of a handful of famous females who would disagree with that assessment.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve listed them all here:</p>
<div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/people-magazines-most-beautiful-women-in-the-world/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"></div><h2 class="block-title">People Magazine&#8217;s Most Beautiful Women in the World: A Lovely Look Back</h2></div></a><div class="block-data"><div class="block-button"><a class="btn" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/people-magazines-most-beautiful-women-in-the-world/"><span>VIEW GALLERY</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="arrow-right" width="32px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 32 12"><g transform="translate(0,12) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill="#000000" stroke="none"><path d="M240 60 l0 -61 35 27 c19 14 35 30 35 34 0 4 -16 20 -35 34 l-35 27 0 -61z"/><path d="M4 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M84 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M164 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>Indeed, Bullock fits pretty snugly into the type of women People typically bestows with this honor:</p>
<p>She&#8217;s classically beautiful. She&#8217;s respected around Hollywood. And she has an Academy Award sitting on her mantel at home.</p>
<p>In fact, since the year 2000, People has never NOT named an actress as the Most Beautiful Woman in the World; with the exception of Beyonce, who <em>does</em> possess more big screen experience than the average artist.</p>
<p>So if you want to be in consideration in 2016, <a href="/stars/kate-upton/">Kate Upton</a>, you may need to make the move from video games to film. (No, not <em>adult</em> films. Sorry, fellas.)</p>
<p>Off the top of your head, can you guess each of the beauties who have nabbed this distinction over the past 15 years? Can you come up with the only three-time winner?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a hint: she&#8217;s the only one <em>not</em> to have actually covered the Most Beautiful issue one year. How come?</p>
<p>Because Bullock, ironically, was given that cover spot in 2011 upon adopting her son Louis.</p>
<p>Give up? Click around the photo gallery above and try not to drool all over your keyboard.</p>

<p>The sitcom star &#8211; who recently dropped out of <em>Up All Night </em>after NBC ordered creative changes &#8211; exchanged vows over the weekend with her boyfriend of four years, Martyn LeNoble.</p>

<p>The couple got engaged on Valentine&#8217;s Day 2010 and have a two-year old daughter together named Sadie Grace.</p>

<p>LeNoble helped found the 1990s rock band Porno for Pyros and has been credited for helping Applegate fight her way through a breast cancer diagnosis.</p>

Are we right here?</p>
<p>Christina Applegate said last year that her goal was to find &#8220;happiness and joy&#8221; – and she&#8217;s done just that with her new finacé Martyn LeNoble.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Christina Applegate and musician Martyn Lenoble are engaged,&#8221; her rep <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20361799,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed to <em>People</em></a><em> </em>Friday. The couple got engaged on February 14.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p style="text-align: left;">Applegate has sure been through a rough couple of years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The Samantha Who?</em> star was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and later underwent a double mastectomy, then reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re thrilled that she&#8217;s feeling better &#8211; and engaged!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This will be the second marriage for both Applegate and LeNoble. No date has been set for the wedding, but we&#8217;re sure it will be magical.
