<p>Dolly Parton is weighing in after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/beyonce-snubbed-by-country-music-awards-beyhive-vows-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the CMAs&#8217; Beyonce disses</a>.</p>



<p>But some wonder if the universally beloved music legend&#8217;s statement is a snub unto itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonce-jolene-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyonce covered Dolly Parton&#8217;s</a> most beloved song &#8212; a very tall order &#8212; on the snubbed album.</p>



<p>Is Dolly Parton chiming in with the disses? Or is she just being a peacemaker while spreading around the praise?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-cma-awards-excluded-beyonce-s-cowboy-carter-and-dolly-parton-has-some-thoughts-on-the-matter">The CMA Awards excluded Beyonce&#8217;s &#8216;Cowboy Carter,&#8217; and Dolly Parton has some thoughts on the matter</h2>



<p>Speaking to <em>Variety</em> in a September 17 interview, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dolly-parton-beyonce-taylor-swift-1236147283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolly Parton diplomatically</a> suggested: &#8220;Well, you never know.&#8221;</p>



<p>She pointed out: “There’s so many wonderful country artists that, I guess probably the country music field.&#8221; There certainly are.</p>



<p>Dolly Parton mused: &#8220;They probably thought, well, we can’t really leave out some of the ones that spend their whole life doing that.”</p>

<p>To be clear, Dolly Parton isn&#8217;t saying that <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonces-cowboy-carter-album-cameos-from-dolly-parton-rumi-carter-leave-fans-reeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Carter</a></em> isn&#8217;t Country. In fact, she called it a &#8220;wonderful album.&#8221;</p>



<p>“She can be very, very proud of, and I think everybody in Country music welcomed her and thought that, that was good,&#8221; Dolly continued.</p>



<p>Of the CMAs not nominating Beyonce&#8217;s album, Dolly Parton opined: &#8220;So I don’t think it was a matter of shutting out, like doing that on purpose. I think it was just more of what the Country charts and the Country artists were doing, that do that all the time, not just a specialty album.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-making-a-country-album-makes-a-lot-of-sense">Beyonce making a Country album makes a lot of sense</h2>



<p>Both Beyonce and Post Malone delved into Country. And Dolly Parton participated in both of their albums, adding that she&#8217;s &#8220;open to everything&#8221; with their future work.</p>



<p>Dolly Parton also affirmed Beyonce&#8217;s Country credentials. “She’s a country girl in Texas and Louisiana, so she grew up with that base.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Country legend emphasized: “It wasn’t like she just appeared out of nowhere. Post Malone has loved country music his whole life, and then I got to do the duet with him on his album, and I think it’s a fantastic album. I thought both those albums were great.”</p>

<p>When Beyonce wrote Cowboy Carter, it stemmed from experiencing exclusion. </p>



<p>Queen Bey has never specified, but most assume that she was referring to her 2016 performance at the CMA Awards.</p>



<p>Which of course makes her album&#8217;s snub from the CMA Awards feel like an acute jab. That and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-1-country-song-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the racist meltdowns</a> over her music playing on Country radio, especially because Bey&#8217;s album debuted at #1 on the charts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-another-hurtful-snub">Is this another hurtful snub?</h2>



<p>Only Beyonce gets to decide if Dolly Parton&#8217;s words are hurtful to her. However, it sounds like Dolly is singing Beyonce&#8217;s praises &#8230; while also suggesting that the CMA Awards exclusion was nothing personal.</p>



<p>To be blunt &#8230; Dolly Parton is giving people too much credit. That&#8217;s not a surprise, because part of what makes her so universally beloved (except by <a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/the-federalist-finds-out-its-never-smart-to-come-for-dolly-parton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weirdos at <em>The Federalist</em></a>) is that she largely stays out of politics.</p>



<p>For the most part, this is wonderful. But when someone disses Beyonce and Dolly Parton suggests that it&#8217;s an accident, her charitable statement might sting a little. Bey&#8217;s album was snubbed. People are allowed to resent that.</p>

<p>The 56th annual Country Music Association Awards aired Wednesday night at Bridgestone Arena, with Luke Bryan and Peyton Manning taking on hosting duties.</p>



<p>Yes, that Peyton Manning.</p>



<p>The former professional quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos.</p>



<p>But the focus of the evening was on the music industry, of course, not the National Football League.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"></figure>



<p>Leading the pack for nominations at the event?</p>



<p>Lainey Wilson, whose 2021 album Sayin&#8217; What I&#8217;m Thinkin&#8217; earned her a total of six nominations, including album of the year, female vocalist of the year, new artist of the year, music video of the year, musical event of the year and song of the year.</p>



<p>Which, if any, of these trophies did she take home?</p>



<p>And who else walked away with some CMA-themed hardware? Scroll down to find out!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>For ages, <em>Dancing With The Stars</em> fans have wondered if <a href="/videos/hannah-brown-and-alan-bersten-are-they-dating/">Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten are dating</a>. They&#8217;d make a very cute couple.</p>
<p>But as they made their stunning red carpet debut at the CMA Awards, fans were reminded repeatedly that they&#8217;re just friends.</p>
<p>These two dance partners have charmed audiences. This week, Alan teased fans on their next big dance challenge.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Hannah Brown&#8217;s look for the CMA Awards was nothing short of breathtaking.</p>
<p>Fans of <em>The Bachelorette</em> and <em>Dancing With The Stars</em> alike ahve seen her show some skin and flash her athletic legs.</p>
<p>This was something different. Hannah looked like a princess in her gorgeous white dress and stark red lipstick.</p>
<p>Alan Bersten looked great by her side. He was well dressed and, as always, handsome.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Hannah Brown&#8217;s chemistry with Alan Bersten has not gone unnoticed by fans and viewers.</p>
<p>They are both 25 and both are extremely attractive.</p>
<p>The pair also have a good rapport, getting along well with one another and getting along.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that they&#8217;re in a relationship. They&#8217;re friends and dance partners. Anything else is <em>tilting at windmills</em>.</p>

<p>Hannah has been sure to quash those romance rumors as they have arisen.</p>
<p>&quot;We are dance partners, and we have the best time together, and we have a friendship that is great,&quot; she affirmed in September.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I&rsquo;m done with roses,&quot; she noted. &quot;So mirrorball [trophy] is what we have our eye on.&quot;</p>
<p>That is a very tasteful and even poetic way to shut down rumors that any of her tangos with Alan have been horizontal.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s going to be a new side of Hannah,&rdquo; Alan teased earlier this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a nice and different side,&quot; he revealed.</p>
<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s going to be nice to me!&quot; Alan joked. &quot;No, I&rsquo;m kidding.&quot;</p>
<p>Awww, these two are just so cute. You can see why some overeager fans like to imagine that they&#8217;re boning on the regular. But they&#8217;re not.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m really excited,&quot; Alan expressed.</p>
<p>His anticipation was high &quot;because we&rsquo;re going to have more of an emotional dance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I&rsquo;m really excited for that,&quot; he explained. &quot;We haven&rsquo;t really shown that side yet.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true enough. Hannah&#8217;s dancing has been positively masterful, but not always evocative.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In fact, Hannah has received some &quot;tough love&quot; from judges over seeming like her mind and passions are disconnected from the dance.</p>
<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t stoop to calling her dancing &quot;robotic&quot; in any way, her excellent form cannot quite compensate for &#8230; emotional reservation.</p>
<p>That said, Hannah and Alan are easily one of the strongest dance teams this season.</p>
<p>Hannah consistently outperforms most of her competition, though James Van Der Beek continues to give her a run for her money.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Hannah and Alan&#8217;s smiles at the red carpet debut were so sweet!</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that overeager shippers who&#8217;d love to see them together do not end up ruining a beautiful friendship.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we look forward to watching these two continue to dominate on <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>.</p>
<p>That said, Hannah will really have to go the extra mile if she wants audiences to believe that she&#8217;s a better dancer than James Van Der Beek.</p>

<p>These days, <a href="/2017/07/miranda-lambert-and-anderson-east-engaged/">Miranda is engaged to Anderson East</a>, and rumors about Blake and Gwen Stefani getting hitched seem to surface at the rate of about one per week.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s never any bad blood between the former first couple of country.</p>
<p>And in the grand tradition of George Jones and Tammy Wynette, and every couple that&#8217;s ever broken up but continued to reside in the same trailer park, Blake and Miranda occasionally air their grievances publicly.</p>
<p>The<a href="/2017/11/cma-awards-2017-list-of-winners/"> 2017 Country Music Association Awards</a> were held last night, and some folks think Miranda seized the opportunity to throw some shade at her ex.</p>
<p>Lambert was one of the night&#8217;s big winners, taking home the prize for Top Female Vocalist, and shining on the red carpet in one of this year&#8217;s most stylish ensembles.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But it was her performance of &quot;To Learn Her&quot; that made Miranda the talk of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Her soaring vocals gained the most attention on social media, but some fans were more interested in what they saw as a subtle shot fired against Blake Shelton.</p>
<p>One line in particular drew a good deal of attention, as many feel that Miranda sent a clear message by rolling her eyes when she delivered the line:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If you take her, you might hate her and be left with just a ray.&quot;</p>
<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s not hard to see how that line could be interpreted as low-key trash talk.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also a chance that it was all in good fun.</p>
<p>As we said, the history of country music is filled with feuding lovers who mined their troubled relationships for song lyric material.</p>
<p>Hell, George and Tammy even recorded a few albums together!</p>
<p>We&#8217;d suggest Blake and Miranda do the same, but we&#8217;re not sure how that would go over with Gwen.</p>
<p>She strikes us as the type who&#8217;d like to leave the past in the past.</p>

<p>The big night opened with the pair mocking Donald Trump because the red-headed President of the United States who did not wear eye protection during the recent solar eclipse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was it a tasteless nod to the man who makes all of the decisions for the United States, or was it a more comical approach?</p>

<p>This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, the CMA Awards celebrated its 50th anniversary in awesome style, as <a href="/2016/11/beyonce-teams-with-the-dixie-chicks-at-the-cma-awards-watch/">Beyonce actually took to the stage</a> to perform her hit &quot;Daddy Lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>As you can see here, she did so alongside The Dixie Chicks.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/beyonce-and-dixie-chicks-daddys-lessons-cma-50th-awards"></a></figure>
<p>The not-so-surprising appearance was hyped heavily by producers, with a Snapchat filter at the event dedicated to the CMA &quot;Bey Watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone in attendance and everyone watching at home gushed over the rendition, with ceremony-goers standing up and dancing throughout and Internet users heaping praise on Beyonce from home.</p>
<p>But not all Internet users, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Because the World Wide Web can be a very mean place and because too many people out there are still cruel, close-minded and ignorant, Beyonce was on the receiving end of numerous threats and racist insults.</p>
<p>&quot;Beyonce performed at the CMAs last night &amp; is on a mission to take country music away from us, hardworking white people!&quot; one terrible person wrote on the official CMA Instagram page, while another added:</p>
<p>&quot;Beyonce overrated racist n***er bitch.&quot;</p>

<p>Truly horrible stuff.</p>
<p>But truly horrible things are sadly said often these days, even from the mouth of someone running for President.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what has turned this into a story.</p>
<p>Instead, what has made these examples into major news is the way the CMA Awards appear to have reacted:</p>
<p>By giving in to the racist trolls and actually removing all photos, videos and references to Beyonce from its social media pages and website.</p>
<p>This is a screen shot of the CMA YouTube page on Thursday.</p>
<p>It features a collection of videos from the ceremony. Good luck trying to find Beyonce and the Dixie Chicks on there&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Here is a photo from the CMA website, circa 4:20 p.m. yesterday,depicting all the performers who were to sing at the ceremony.</p>
<p>See Beyonce anywhere?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>These moves certainly seemed to be in response to the following kinds of comments, which emanated from the Twitter accounts of bigots around the country:&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Soon after various outlets started reporting on the way the awards ceremony scrubbed Beyonce from all of its accounts, photos and footage from her performance did start to appear again.</p>
<p>According to TMZ, this did not happen until <em>after</em> TMZ started working on its story and talking to CMA sources.</p>
<p>The Dixie Chicks, for their part, stood strong by their new friend and duet partner, Tweeting a link to Beyonce&#8217;s &quot;Daddy Lessons&quot; video and writing:</p>
<p>&quot;If we all turn this up really loud, together we can drown out the hate.&quot;</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>A statement from CMA to E! News, meanwhile, reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;CMA has not erased any mentions of Beyonc&eacute;&#8217;s performance on the CMA Awards.</p>
<p>&quot;In advance of the broadcast, CMA removed a 5-second promotional clip from ABC.com and CMA&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>&quot;The promo was unapproved and CMA removed it prior to the broadcast. Beyonc&eacute;&#8217;s performance with Dixie Chicks was a highlight of the evening and we are continuing to share the amazing full-length performance clip via our official social channels.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s evidence, which we shared above, that points to the contrary.</p>

<p>Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley co-hosted the event for the ninth (!) straight year as the CMA Awards marked its fifth decade.</p>
<p>As always, they were in their element and well received.</p>
<p>Slightly less expected was the <a href="/2016/11/beyonce-teams-with-the-dixie-chicks-at-the-cma-awards-watch/">Beyonce-Dixie Chicks performance</a>, which is not something we see every year, but which was a big hot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="/2016/11/taylor-swift-continues-comeback-presents-at-cma-awards/">Taylor Swift continued her comeback</a> with an appearance, and we suppose there were some awards to hand out as well.</p>
<p>There were some pretty big upsets last night, in fact.</p>

<p>Eric Church and Brothers Osborne, considered substantial underdogs in their respective categories, triumphed with unexpected wins.</p>
<p>Chris Stapleton, rags-to-riches darling of the 2015 CMAs, proved he&#8217;s no flash in the pan by snagging Male Vocalist of the Year again.</p>
<p>And for all the talk about the changing landscape of country, perhaps it was fitting that the next 50 years began as a tribute to the last 50.</p>
<p>Numerous all-time greats were honored, none more so than Garth Brooks taking home Entertainer of the Year for the first time since 1998.</p>

<p>What happens when an event features the world&#8217;s two biggest solo artists and recognizes the very best in country music&#8230; yet no one is around to see it?</p>
<p>Did it really happen?</p>
<p>Such was the case for the CMAs because the ceremony went up last night against Game 7 of the World Series on Fox.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="846" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-846x1024.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift Presets at CMAs" class="wp-image-245951" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-846x1024.jpg 846w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-248x300.jpg 248w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-768x929.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-735x889.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-277x335.jpg 277w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-287x347.jpg 287w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-430x520.jpg 430w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-529x640.jpg 529w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-635x768.jpg 635w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-794x960.jpg 794w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas-893x1080.jpg 893w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/taylor-swift-presets-at-cmas.jpg 1197w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But the not even the Chicago Cubs capturing their first title since 1908 could completely distract from what took place instead Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because <a href="/2016/11/beyonce-teams-with-the-dixie-chicks-at-the-cma-awards-watch/">Beyonce actually went a little bit country</a>, taking the stage with members of The Dixie Chicks to sing a rendition of her hit &quot;Daddy Lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>Really! This happened! For those who missed it&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/beyonce-and-dixie-chicks-daddys-lessons-cma-50th-awards"></a></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, Taylor Swift made her first appearance at the CMA Awards since 2013.</p>
<p>Back then, Swift received the Pinnacle Award, becoming only the second person (along with Garth Brooks) to receive this recognition from the Country Music Association.</p>
<p>She also won three other trophies in 2013, including the International Artist Achievement Award and the Music Video and Music Event of the Year awards.</p>
<p>In 2014, Swift was nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year, which she previously won in 2009, yet she did not attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>That was also the year in which Swift crossed over into mainstream pop music with the album &quot;1989,&quot; which explains why she was not nominated for anything in 2015.</p>

<p>But Taylor has been making a slight comeback over the past few weeks, following a hiatus from the spotlight after she was called out as a liar by <a href="/stars/kim-kardashian.html">Kim Kardashian</a> and Kanye&nbsp;West.</p>
<p>She also split from Tom Hiddleston&nbsp;this summer, her second high-profile breakup of the year.</p>
<p>It made sense that Swift needed a little break from&#8230; well&#8230; nearly everything and everyone.</p>
<p>But the superstar shared some photos from a Halloween party this week and also confessed that <a href="/2016/11/taylor-swift-break-up-song-its-here-sort-of/">she wrote the country song</a> &quot;Better Man&quot; for the group Little Big Town.</p>
<p>(Little Big Town also performed the song earlier in the ceremony, going on to win Vocal Group of the Year last night.)</p>
<p>And then she surprised some viewers at the CMA Awards by presenting the Entertainer of the Year Award to Brooks.</p>

<p><strong>WATCH</strong> Swift receive a solid ovation from those in attendance below and then join us in wondering:</p>
<p>Is this all a build-up to a new Taylor Swift album before the year is over?!?</p>
<p>She is due for one, after all, with Taylor having come out with new music toward the conclusion of every other year.</p>

<p>The <a href="/2016/11/chicago-cubs-capture-first-world-series-title-since-1908/">Chicago Cubs winning their first World Series</a> title since 1908 after seven epic games and even an extra inning against the Cleveland Indians?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>But also this: Beyonce performed at the 50th annual CMA Awards on Wednesday night!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/beyonce-and-dixie-chicks-daddys-lessons-cma-50th-awards"></a></figure>
<p>The artist&#8217;s appearance at this country music awards ceremony failed to be a well-kept secret, with social media exploding in the days prior with strong chatter that Beyonce would be on hand.</p>
<p>But that didn&#8217;t take make it any less thrilled to see Queen Bey on stage at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The pop star basically pulled a reverse-Taylor Swift by taking the stage to sing her smash hit, the twangy tune &ldquo;Daddy Lessons,&rdquo; with some alums of the annual Nashville party.</p>
<p>Natalie Maines, Emily Robison and Martie Maguire each sang parts of chorus during the upbeat and exciting performance, with the artists joined by a full band&#8230; including harmonica, saxophone and banjo players.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re guessing you never thought you&#8217;d see these instruments on stage alongside Beyonce.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-1024x681.jpg" alt="Beyonce and The Dixie Chicks" class="wp-image-245945" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-735x489.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-520x346.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-640x426.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-960x638.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/beyonce-and-the-dixie-chicks-1080x718.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Beyonce rocked an all-white, see-through dress for the occasion, while the Dixie Chicks matched in black.</p>
<p>At one point, the quartet broke into an interlude from the award-winning group&rsquo;s 2002 tune &ldquo;Long Time Gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the famous and occasionally controversial girl group covered &ldquo;Daddy Lessons&rdquo; during tour stops in Manchester and London.</p>
<p>Video of those performances quickly went viral, as was the case with the one above at the CMA Awards, of course.</p>

<p>Beyonce, meanwhile, shocked fans when she included &quot;Daddy Lessons&quot; on her hit album, &quot;Lemonade.&quot;</p>
<p>It quickly earned rave reviews from such country musicians as Dierks Bentley, Karen Fairchild, Blake Shelton and Garth Brooks.</p>
<p>The mother of Blue Ivy, of course, has made it a habit to steal all headlines and all thunder from pretty much all awards shows.</p>
<p>Remember her at the BET Awards?</p>

<p>How could you forget, right?!?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Miranda Lambert won Best Female Vocalist at the <a href="/2015/11/cma-awards-2015-list-of-winners/">CMA Awards</a> for the sixth consecutive time on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>But this one felt different from past victories.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Lambert didn&#8217;t just divorce fellow country star Blake Shelton a few months ago, she spent this week hearing all about rumors that Shelton is now dating pop icon and <em>The Voice </em>co-star Gwen Stefani.</p>
<p>Then, mere hours before the CMAs aired live from Nashville, <a href="/2015/11/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-yup-were-dating/">Stefani confirmed she is boning Shelton</a>, Lambert&#8217;s famous ex-husband.</p>
<p>Who, of course, happened to be in attendance at the event.</p>
<p>Awkward much?!?</p>
<p>But Lambert handled the situation like a professional, first putting on an outstanding performance of her new single &quot;Bathroom Sink&quot; and then being called on stage to accept the aforementioned award.</p>
<p>&quot;Man, I appreciate it. I needed a bright spot this year, so thank you,&quot; the artist said in her acceptance speech, making a clear reference to her divorce.</p>
<p>Mentioning another powerhouse performance from an unlikely duo earlier in the evening, Lambert then added in conclusion:</p>
<p>&quot;I love country music fans, and I&#8217;m just gonna keep it short, but Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton, thank you very much. I&#8217;m gonna go home and practice.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank y&#8217;all very much, I love y&#8217;all.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lambert defeated such major stars as Carrie Underwood and Kacey Musgraves to take home Best Female Vocalist here in 2015.</p>
<p>Well deserved, we say!</p>
