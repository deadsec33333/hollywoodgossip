<p>It&#8217;s the end of an era for the New York Jets &#8212; albeit, a very short, unsatisfying era.</p>



<p>The NFL team announced today that it will be parting ways with controversial quarterback Aaron Rodgers.</p>



<p>Rodgers is a former league MVP, a Super Bowl champ, and a future Hall of Famer. But his tenure with the Jets lasted only slightly longer than his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/shailene-woodley-breaks-down-over-toxic-aaron-rodgers-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship with Shailene Woodley</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-start-spreading-the-news">Start Spreading the News&#8230;</h2>



<p>News of Rodgers&#8217; release comes to us straight from the Jets, who tweeted their decision on Thursday.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have informed Aaron Rodgers that we will be moving in a different direction at quarterback,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/nyjets/status/1890069239396282635?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">the team&#8217;s official account wrote</a>.</p>



<p>Newly hired Jets head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey provided further detail:</p>

<p>&#8220;Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback,&#8221; said Glenn and Mougey in <a href="https://www.newyorkjets.com/news/jets-moving-on-from-aaron-rodgers">a statement</a> released by the team. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets,&#8221; added Jets co-owner Woody Johnson in a statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-radio-silence-from-rodgers">Radio Silence From Rodgers</h2>



<p>Rodgers has yet to publicly respond to the news, which is not surprising.</p>



<p>For one thing, the 41-year-old QB is generally not very active on social media. On top of that, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/shailene-woodley-breaks-down-over-toxic-aaron-rodgers-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodgers is of a notoriously cantankerous disposition</a>, and you can bet that he&#8217;s not thrilled about being dismissed so publicly.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-1024x683.jpg" alt="Quarterback Aaron Rodgers #8 of the New York Jets sacked by defensive end Leonard Floyd #56 of the Buffalo Bills during the first quarter of the NFL game at MetLife Stadium on September 11, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey." class="wp-image-519200" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1674987050-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Quarterback Aaron Rodgers #8 of the New York Jets sacked by defensive end Leonard Floyd #56 of the Buffalo Bills during the first quarter of the NFL game at MetLife Stadium on September 11, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Then again, maybe he&#8217;s okay with the decision.</p>



<p>For one thing, Rodgers was never a great fit with the Jets. He tore his Achilles tendon in his very first game with the team in 2023, and he was forced to sit out the remainder of the season.</p>



<p>He stayed healthy throughout 2024, but the results weren&#8217;t much better, as the Jets finished 5-12 and missed the playoffs.</p>



<p>On top of that, Jets owner Johnson is the heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune. And we all know <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/aaron-rodgers-offers-update-on-covid-battle-joe-rogan-told-me-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Aaron feels about pharmaceutical companies</a>!</p>



<p>It remains to be seen what the future holds for both parties. But maybe neither can do much worse than they did the past two years.</p>

<p>Aaron Rodgers has a lot to complain about at the moment.</p>



<p>His New York Jets are 4-10 and certain to miss the NFL playoffs, and his ex-girlfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/shailene-woodley-breaks-down-over-toxic-aaron-rodgers-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shailene Woodley is finally opening up</a> about their toxic relationship.</p>



<p>And Aaron&#8217;s not known for his sunny disposition even when things are going well, so you can bet that he&#8217;s especially grumpy these days.</p>

<p>Yes, the future Hall of Famer has a long history of sullenness, and he opens up about some of his past problems in a new Netflix docuseries entitled <em>Aaron Rodgers: Enigma</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-rodgers-speaks-out-on-falling-out-with-family">Aaron Rodgers Speaks Out on Falling Out With Family </h2>



<p>Episode two of the series finds Aaron speaking out about his strained relationship with brother Jordan Rodgers, which came to light during the latter&#8217;s time on <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a></em>.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t like I was super duper close with everybody in the family. I was close with my little brother,” Aaron says on the show, which started streaming on Tuesday. </p>

<p>“But in actuality, it goes back to stuff from high school that kind of made me feel distant. Stuff in college, stuff post-college.”</p>



<p>Aaron explained that he initially “was quiet about” his family&#8217;s issues, adding, “I thought the best way to do it was just don’t talk about it publicly.”</p>



<p>But that privacy came to an end when Jordan became a reality star.</p>



<p>“And what do they do? They go on a bulls&#8211;t show and leave two empty chairs,” Aaron complained in the doc.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-public-display-of-bad-blood">A Public Display of Bad Blood</h2>



<p>The situation came to a head when JoJo Fletcher visited the Rodgers family during her hometown round. </p>



<p>She and Jordan ate dinner with his parents, and producers made the surprising decision to leave two empty seats at the table to represent Aaron and his then-girlfriend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/olivia-munn/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olivia Munn</a>.</p>



<p>“They all agreed this was a good thing to do, to leave two empty chairs at a stupid dating show that my brother just went on to get famous &#8212; his words, not mine. That he ended up winning,” Aaron said in <em>Enigma</em>. </p>

<p>“But a dinner that was during the season, I was never asked to go to. Not that I would’ve gone.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/04/jojo-fletcher-and-jordan-rodgers-are-they-finally-getting-marrie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan went on to marry JoJo</a> in 2022. And Aaron says he continues to wish his brother all the best &#8212; even if they&#8217;re still not on speaking terms.</p>



<p>“People ask me, ‘Is there hope for reconciliation?’ I say, ‘Yeah of course. Of course,’” Aaron said on the Netflix show. </p>



<p>“I don’t want them to fail, to struggle, to have any strife or issues. I don’t wish any ill will on them at all. It’s more like this &#8212; we’re just different steps on a timeline of our own journeys.”</p>



<p>Hopefully, Aaron and Jordan can patch things up soon. In the meantime, Aaron needs to focus on his relationship with receivers!</p>

<p>As professional football fans know, the relationship in 2024 between Aaron Rodgers and the New York Jets has not been healthy for either side.</p>



<p>The team is 3-9 and Rodgers has a quarterback rating of 87.5, the lowest of his career.</p>



<p>As it turns out, meanwhile, Rodgers <em>also</em> had a negative effect on Shailene Woodley back when he and the actress were a serious item.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514362" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187449584-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shailene Woodley attends The Gothams 34th Annual Film Awards at Cipriani Wall Street in New York on December 2, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t shared much about my relationship with Aaron,&#8221; Woodley told <em>Outside</em> magazine in an interview published December 3. &#8220;Because it always makes me cry.&#8221;</p>



<p>The couple <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/aaron-rodgers-and-shailene-woodley-the-engagement-is-over/">ended their engagement in February 2022</a> after about two years of dating.</p>



<p>We aren&#8217;t totally sure what happened between the celebrities, but Woodley said some rather strange and cryptic things in the aforementioned piece.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was not right. But it was beautiful,&#8221; she told the publication, for example.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514363" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2175940804-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shailene Woodley attends the Miu Miu Paris Womenswear S/S 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week at Palais d&#8217;Iena on October 01, 2024 in Paris, France. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Victor Boyko/Getty Images for Miu Miu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Woodley doesn&#8217;t use her ex-fiance&#8217;s name in this piece, but <em>does</em> mention that she had to rebuild herself after she had &#8220;a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022,&#8221; seemingly citing their break-up.</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy,&#8221; the actress explained. &#8220;I really understood depression and anxiety and, like, complete soul detachment.&#8221;</p>



<p>An insider claimed back then that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/shailene-woodley-aaron-rodgers-cared-about-football-more-than-he/">Rodgers chose football over Woodley</a>.</p>



<p>“While Shailene is supportive of Aaron’s career, he put football first and they were barely spending any time together,” a source told <em>In Touch Weekly</em>, adding:</p>



<p>“She felt he neglected their relationship. Neither of them was happy.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514364" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2187876068-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aaron Rodgers of the New York Jets puts on his helmet against the Seattle Seahawks during the first quarter at MetLife Stadium on December 1, 2024 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Luke Hales/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 33-year-old even told the outlet that she decided to remain in a &#8220;toxic situation&#8221; because she found herself empathizing with &#8220;someone else,&#8221; stating: </p>



<p>&#8220;Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Woodley and the polarizing athlete went public with their relationship in February 2021, shortly before announcing their engagement. </p>



<p>The attention at the time took Woodley by surprise.</p>



<p>&#8220;It honestly never really hit me that millions of people around the world were actually watching these things and paid attention to them,&#8221; she told PORTER in 2023. </p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I dated somebody in America who was very, very famous. It was the first time that I&#8217;d had a quote-unquote ‘famous&#8217; relationship, and I watched [the] scrutiny, opinions, the desire for people to know my life and his life and our life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remarks made by New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers regarding the HIV crisis of the 1980s are generating a tremendous amount of controversy this week.</p>



<p>The controversial QB has long had a reputation for espousing bizarre and potentially harmful conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Now, the 40-year-old NFL vet finds himself at the center of yet another unexpected controversy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-rodgers-shares-controversial-views-on-hiv-crisis">Aaron Rodgers Shares Controversial Views on HIV Crisis</h2>



<p>In March, Rodgers appeared on the &#8220;Look Into It with Eddie Bravo&#8221; podcast in March, where he shared his belief that the HIV epidemic of the 1980s was engineered by the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases with the assistance of the federal government.</p>



<p>&#8220;The blueprint, the game plan, was made in the &#8217;80s,&#8221; Rodgers said, according to <em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/aaron-rodgers-hiv-comments-backlash-1891122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Create a pandemic, you know, with a virus that&#8217;s going wild, right?&#8221; he continued.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-1024x683.jpg" alt="New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers poses with a jersey during an introductory press conference at Atlantic Health Jets Training Center on April 26, 2023 in Florham Park, New Jersey." class="wp-image-498025" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1485486409-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers poses with a jersey during an introductory press conference at Atlantic Health Jets Training Center on April 26, 2023 in Florham Park, New Jersey.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Only—he was given, Fauci was given over $350 million to research this, to come up with drugs, new or repurposed to handle the AIDS pandemic. And all they came up with AZ—was AZT.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rodgers&#8217; remarks went mostly unnoticed at the time, but they resurfaced on Twitter this week, and a clip of the quarterback sharing his views on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/03/joe-biden-to-texas-residents-ignore-your-dumb-governor-wear-a-ma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Anthony Fauci</a> has now been viewed more than 5 million times.</p>



<p>&#8220;And if you do even a smidge of research &#8212; and I know, I&#8217;m not an epidemiologist, I&#8217;m not a doctor, I&#8217;m not an immunologist, whatever the f&#8211;k &#8212; I can read, though,&#8221; Rodgers said during the podcast.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I can learn and look things up just like any normal person, you know. I can do my own research, which is so vilified, to even question authority,&#8221; he added.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-1024x683.jpg" alt="NFL Player Aaron Rodgers attends the NFL Honors at University of Minnesota on February 3, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota." class="wp-image-498024" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-913982096-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NFL Player Aaron Rodgers attends the NFL Honors at University of Minnesota on February 3, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But that was the game plan back then: create an environment where only one thing works. Back then, AZT. Now? Remdesivir until we get a vaccine,&#8221;</p>



<p>Remdesivir is a drug that has been shown to halt the progression of the Covid virus inside the body.</p>



<p>From there, Rodgers alleged that Fauci had a &#8220;stake in the Moderna vaccine,&#8221; though he offered no evidence that the medical expert in any way benefitted financially from the vaccine.</p>



<p>As <em>Newsweek</em> reports, social media users were quick to shut down Rodgers&#8217; latest conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rodgers-receives-criticism-on-social-media">Rodgers Receives Criticism on Social Media</h2>



<p>&#8220;Can someone please take Aaron Rodgers home and make him stay inside until his head is fixed?&#8221; one person asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just a reminder, Dr Fauci is a hero. Aaron Rodgers is a clown,&#8221; said another.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aaron Rodgers is the worst type of idiot—the one who&#8217;s convinced he&#8217;s a genius,&#8221; a third user wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please keep Aaron Rodgers &amp; his weird conspiracy theories off of my timeline. Dude has choked on one too many shrooms dipped in acid,&#8221; a fourth chimed in.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers #8 of the New York Jets looks on from the sideline prior to the game against the Miami Dolphins at MetLife Stadium on November 24, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey." class="wp-image-498027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1811962917-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aaron Rodgers #8 of the New York Jets looks on from the sideline prior to the game against the Miami Dolphins at MetLife Stadium on November 24, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But Rodgers also received support from many commenters who shared his views.</p>



<p>&#8220;People are finally speaking out,&#8221; one person wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;In 3-5yrs everything Rodgers is saying will be considered fact and all the non-thinkers, unwilling to deviate from what TV tells them, will deny calling Rodgers a conspiracy theorist. I&#8217;ve seen this one before…&#8221; added another.</p>



<p>Rodgers has yet to respond to the criticism of his remarks &#8212; but whether he likes it or not, it looks like the future hall-of-famer is at the center of another heated debate.</p>

<p>A new report from CNN alleges that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has expressed support for bizarre conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting.</p>



<p>Journalists Jake Tapper and Pamela Brown reported this week that in &#8220;private conversations,&#8221; Rodgers shared his belief that the shooting &#8212; which claimed the lives of 26 people, many of them young children &#8212; was a hoax.</p>



<p>The conspiracy theory has gained popularity among far-rightwing extremists in recent years, thanks largely to its endorsement by political commentator Alex Jones.</p>



<p>Rodgers has been receiving a good deal of attention in political circles this week thanks to reports that presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is considering the QB as his running mate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-rodgers-alleges-sandy-hook-was-a-hoax">Aaron Rodgers Alleges Sandy Hook Was a Hoax</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/13/politics/aaron-rodgers-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theories/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>&#8216;s report, “In private conversations [Rodgers has] shared deranged conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting not being real.”</p>



<p>One such conversation allegedly occurred when Rodgers was introduced to Brown at the Kentucky Derby in 2013.</p>



<p>“Hearing that she was a journalist with CNN, Rodgers immediately began attacking the news media for covering up important stories,&#8221; the report reads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodgers brought up the tragic killing of 20 children and 6 adults by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School, claiming it was actually a government inside job and the media was intentionally ignoring it.”</p>



<p>In a second conversation with an anonymous source, Rodgers allegedly said:</p>



<p>“Sandy Hook never happened &#8230; All those children never existed. [The parents] were all actors. They’re all making it up. They’re all actors.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Rodgers went on to delve into some of the darker caverns of the false conspiracy theory,&#8221; the report continues, adding, &#8220;This person found the encounter disturbing.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-rodgers-long-history-of-controversial-comments">Aaron Rodgers&#8217; Long History of Controversial Comments</h2>



<p>The 40-year-old football star&#8217;s political beliefs have been a frequent source of controversy in recent years.</p>



<p>Former NFL quarterback DeShone Kizer indicated in an interview that Rodgers was a 9/11 truther.</p>



<p>Before that, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/aaron-rodgers-offers-update-on-covid-battle-joe-rogan-told-me-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodgers declined to take the COVID-19 vaccine</a> during the pandemic and was accused of making misleading statements to the press in order to create the false impression that he&#8217;d gotten the shot.</p>

<p>Rodgers has also been highly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/aaron-rodgers-joe-biden-is-dumb-and-so-is-everyone-who-voted-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical of Joe Biden</a>, alleging that the president and all who voted for him are dangerously ignorant. </p>



<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/jimmy-kimmel-simply-destroys-aaron-rodgers-in-monologue-qb-offers-very-lame-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodgers went on the attack against Jimmy Kimmel</a>, alleging that the late-night host was a frequented visitor of the private island owned by deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p>However, there is no real reason to believe that Kimmel ever met Epstein, much less visited his island, and the comic angrily responded to Rodgers&#8217; claims on his ABC talk show.</p>

<p>Rodgers has yet to publicly respond to the report of his Sandy Hook claims.</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s no word from the Kennedy campaign with regard to whether the candidate is still considering Rodgers as a possible running mate.</p>



<p>As many have pointed out, if Rodgers enters the political arena, he&#8217;ll be facing a much more aggressive media than he&#8217;s dealt with throughout his playing career.</p>



<p>And this preview of the scrutiny he&#8217;ll face might convince the QB to stick to football.</p>



<p>UPDATE: Rodgers has now taken to X (formerly Twitter) to tell his side of the story with the statement below:</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;As I’m on the record saying in the past, what happened in Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy. I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place. </p>



<p>&#8220;Again, I hope that we learn from this and other tragedies to identify the signs that will allow us to prevent unnecessary loss of life. </p>



<p>&#8220;My thoughts and prayers continue to remain with the families affected along with the entire Sandy Hook community.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p><strong><em>DING! DING! DING!</em></strong></p>



<p>It remains very much <em>on</em> between Jimmy Kimmel and Aaron Rodgers.</p>



<p>Last week, as you might recall, Rodgers upped the ante in his ongoing feud with the talk show host by implying that Kimmel&#8217;s name might be on the list of clients who paid late billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in order to sleep with underage girls.</p>



<p>Simply put, he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/jimmy-kimmel-claps-back-at-aaron-rodgers-i-never-went-to-jeffrey-epsteins-island-a-hole/">accused Kimmel of being a pedophile</a>.</p>

<p>On Monday night, Kimmel fired back at the controversial quarterback.</p>



<p>Following the release of a list that did NOT include his name on it, Kimmel said in his monologue:</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t know Jeffrey Epstein. I’ve never met Jeffrey Epstein. I am not on the list. I was not on a plane or an island or anything &#8212; ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kimmel then emphasized how those close to him have been threatened ever since Rodgers made this accusation.</p>



<p>“A lot of delusional people honestly believe I am meeting up with Tom Hanks and Oprah at Shakies once a week to eat pizza and drink the blood of children,” he added. </p>



<p>“And I know this because I hear from these people often. My wife hears from them. My kids hear from them, my poor mailman hears from these people. </p>



<p>&#8220;And now we’re hearing from lots more of them thanks to Aaron Rodgers.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the past, Kimmel mocked Rodgers for his anti-COVID-19 stance and for lying to the public about whether he had been vaccinated.</p>



<p>&#8220;To retaliate, he decided to insinuate that I am a pedophile,” Kimmel continued. </p>



<p>“This is how these nuts do it now. You don’t like Trump &#8212; you’re a pedophile. It’s their go-to move. And it shows you how much they actually care about pedophilia.&#8221;</p>



<p>From there, Kimmel went off on people such as Rodgers&#8230; on people who have one exceptional talent, and therefore believe they are an expert on EVERYthing.</p>



<p>“He believes himself to be an extraordinary being. He genuinely thinks that because God gave him the ability to throw a ball, he’s smarter than everyone else,” the host went on. </p>



<p>“The idea that his brain is just average is unfathomable to him. We learned during Covid [that] somehow he knows more about science than scientists. A guy who went to community college then got into Cal on a football scholarship and didn’t graduate. </p>



<p>&#8220;Someone who never spent a minute studying the human body is an expert in the field of immunology. He just put on a magic helmet and that G made him a genius.”</p>

<p>Kimmel continued:</p>



<p>&#8220;Aaron got two A’s on his report card and they were both in the word Aaron. Can you imagine that this hamster brain man thinks he knows what the government is up to because he’s a quarterback doing research on YouTube and listening to podcasts?&#8221;</p>



<p>Toward the end of his monologue, Kimmel said he would accept an apology from Rodgers.</p>



<p>But he definitely does not expect he&#8217;ll get one.</p>

<p>Cut to Tuesday and Rodgers&#8217; weekly appearance on The Pat McAfee Show.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that Jimmy is not on the list, I really am, I don’t think he’s the P-word,” Rodgers said in response. </p>



<p>“I think it’s impressive that a man who went to Arizona State and has 10 joke writers can read off a prompter… I wish him the best. </p>



<p>&#8220;Again, I don’t give a sh-t what he says about me, but as long as he understands what I actually said, that I’m not accusing him of being on a list, I’m all for moving forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without any real ammunition &#8212; because he&#8217;s totally wrong and is an ignorant moron who can&#8217;t compete with Kimmel&#8217;s platform and/or levels of intelligence, wit or insight &#8212; Rodgers simply concluded:</p>



<p>“I hope that he will give the same type of energy to these heinous crimes when they do come out that you gave to other subjects that you spent a lot of time working on.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll give the final words here to Kimmel, courtesy of Monday&#8217;s monologue again:</p>



<p>“When I do get something wrong, which happens on rare occasions, you know what I do? I apologize.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which is what Aaron Rodgers should do, which is what a decent person would do. But I bet he won’t. If he does, you know what I’ll do? I’ll accept his apology and move on. But he probably won’t do that. </p>



<p>&#8220;My guess is he won’t apologize.”</p>

<p>Celebrity feuds don&#8217;t get much more random than the current beef between late-night host Jimmy Kimmel and New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers.</p>



<p>And the insanity of the situation is enhanced by the fact that this is not some petty disagreement over a perceived slight at an award show.</p>



<p>No, this is an intense, high-stakes war of words that began when Rodgers bizarrely implied that Kimmel&#8217;s name will be found on the list of public figures with ties to infamous billionaire sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p>The allegation came during Rodgers&#8217; latest appearance on The Pat McAfee Show.</p>

<p>When the host made mention of the Epstein list &#8212; which might soon be made public by order of a New York judge &#8212; Rodgers replied:</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, really hoping that doesn’t come out.”</p>



<p>The bad blood between Kimmel and Rodgers dates back to 2021 when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/aaron-rodgers-offers-update-on-covid-battle-joe-rogan-told-me-i/">Rodgers expressed skepticism about the earliest versions of the Covid-19 vaccine</a>.</p>

<p>Until yesterday, the two combatants had stuck to making jokes at one another&#8217;s expense.</p>



<p>But in his latest X/Twitter post, Kimmel upped the ante by threatening to take Rodgers to court.</p>



<p>“Dear Aassh-le: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein, nor will you find my name on any ‘list’ other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality,&#8221; Kimmel wrote.</p>

<p>Yes, to the surprise of no one, Kimmel did not see the humor in Rodgers&#8217; implication that he was involved in the most notorious sex trafficking ring in modern history.</p>



<p>Rodgers has yet to respond to the comedian&#8217;s legal threat, which is probably for the best.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The current NFL season has been rocky enough for Rodgers, who suffered an Achilles tendon injury in his very first game with the Jets and has not returned to the field since.</p>



<p>Rodgers has remained steadfast in his opposition to the NFL&#8217;s Covid vaccine mandate.</p>



<p>The future Hall of Famer&#8217;s views have brought him into conflict with many fellow celebs, including Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who has endorsed Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine in a multimillion-dollar ad campaign.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce wears a white uniform within a sports arena." class="wp-image-489439" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/0103_traviskelce_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs looks on without his helmet on the way to the locker room during halftime against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium on December 17, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Rodgers derisively referred to Kelce as &#8220;Mr. Pfizer&#8221; in one interview, a remark that the Chiefs standout simply laughed off in a press conference.</p>



<p>Of course, when you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-ring-in-new-year-with-a-kiss/">dating the most famous woman on the planet</a>, you can&#8217;t afford to get involved with petty feuds.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Travis is finding it easier than ever to shake off the rude remarks from haters.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Jimmy Kimmel has decided to take a very different approach to Rodgers&#8217; jabs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been a roller coaster year for Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p>Despite some major professional controversies and disappointments &#8212; including allegations that he <a href="/2022/01/aaron-rodgers-joe-biden-is-dumb-and-so-is-everyone-who-voted-for/">lied about being vaccinated</a> and a shocking playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers &#8212; Rodgers took home NFL MVP honors for the second time in his career.</p>
<p>And the Packers star&#8217;s personal life was also characterized by breakneck reversals of fortune.</p>
<p>In early 2021,&nbsp;<a href="/2021/02/shailene-woodley-confirms-im-engaged-to-aaron-rodgers/">Rodgers got engaged to Shailene Woodley</a>, the Hollywood actress whose bohemian ways seemed to nicely offset his famously cantankerous personality.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But while opposites often attract, it seems that in the case of Aaron and Shailene, the wildly different worldviews created more problems than their relationship could endure.</p>
<p>In February of this year, rumors that <a href="/2022/02/aaron-rodgers-and-shailene-woodley-the-engagement-is-over/">Rodgers and Woodley had called off their engagement</a>&nbsp;began to circulate in the tabloid press and on social media.</p>
<p>Insiders confirmed that it was Shailene who pulled the plug on the relationship after months of feeling that Rodgers cared more about football than he did about her.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="701" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-701x1024.jpg" alt="Shailene Woodley in Canada" class="wp-image-116617" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-701x1024.jpg 701w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-205x300.jpg 205w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-768x1123.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-1051x1536.jpg 1051w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-1401x2048.jpg 1401w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-735x1074.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-229x335.jpg 229w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-237x347.jpg 237w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-356x520.jpg 356w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-438x640.jpg 438w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-525x768.jpg 525w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-657x960.jpg 657w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-739x1080.jpg 739w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/shailene-woodley-in-canada-scaled.jpg 1751w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;While Shailene is supportive of Aaron&rsquo;s career, he put football first and they were barely spending any time together,&rdquo; a source close to the situation told <em>In Touch</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She felt he neglected their relationship. Neither of them was happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the dust began to settle from the 2021 NFL season and Aaron renewed his contract with the Packers (a $150 million deal will put anyone in a better mood), he and Shailene decided to give their relationship a second chance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, it now looks as though the experiment failed, and Rodgers and Woodley have gone their way for a second time.</p>
<p>News of the split comes to us courtesy of E! News, who reports that once again, it was Shailene who decided to end the relationship.</p>
<p>&quot;Shailene tried to give it another shot and was spending time with Aaron,&quot; <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1328433/why-shailene-woodley-is-done-with-ex-aaron-rodgers-after-recent-reunions">an insider</a> tells the outlet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;But she quickly saw that everything was on his terms and nothing was going to change. There was no reason to continue and she&#8217;s done with it again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are two very different people,&quot; a separate source tells E! News.</p>
<p>&quot;They are both focused on their careers, but it took them in separate directions.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While Aaron and Shailene might have parted ways permanently, the second insider says that the two of them are still &quot;supportive of one another and on good terms.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest in a long line of high-profile breakups for Rodgers, who parted ways with NASCAR driver Danica Patrick in 2020.</p>
<p>Prior to that <a href="/2017/05/aaron-rodgers-did-he-cheat-on-olivia-munn-with-kelly-rohrbach/">Rodgers dated actress Olivia Munn</a> for several years.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-683x1024.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers Attends The 2017 ESPYS" class="wp-image-274793" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-attends-the-2017-espys-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>In all of those cases, the splits were amicable, and Rodgers seems to be on civil terms with most if not all of his exes.</p>
<p>(For evidence of this, look no further than the QB&#8217;s friendly post-game interviews with Erin Andrews, whom he also dated briefly.)</p>
<p>But it looks as though Rodgers&#8217; search for the right partner will continue after yet another false start.</p>
<p>And if he&#8217;s as focused on his career as Shailene says he is, maybe he should complete his quest for another Super Bowl ring before he thinks any more about wedding rings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When <a href="/2021/11/aaron-rodgers-offers-update-on-covid-battle-joe-rogan-told-me-i/">Aaron Rodgers caught Covid</a> after lying to the world and claiming he&#8217;d been vaccinated, Shailene Woodley put her reputation on the line to defend him.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/02/shailene-woodley-confirms-im-engaged-to-aaron-rodgers/">Rodgers and Woodley were engaged</a> at the time, so it made sense that she would have his back, of course.</p>
<p>But the actress went above the call of duty and showed a side of herself that we&#8217;d never seen before during the controversy, railing against the media and lashing out at some random dude on the street, speculating that his d-ck must be smaller than Rodgers&#8217; because he drives a crappy car.</p>
<p>Yeah, it didn&#8217;t really make sense at the time, and Woodley is probably regretting it these days, having been <a href="/2022/02/aaron-rodgers-and-shailene-woodley-the-engagement-is-over/">dumped by Rodgers </a>just a few weeks later.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Some were some surprised by this week&#8217;s news that Rodgers and Woodley had called off their engagement.</p>
<p>But others realized that the 2021 NFL MVP has a reputation for being obsessive, egotistical, and &#8230; well, a little bit of a jerk.</p>
<p>Shailene, on the other hand, is a free spirit type who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kesha-brushes-teeth-with-jack-daniels-15-years-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="185">brushes her teeth</a> with clay, so it&#8217;s not shocking that their relationship couldn&#8217;t withstand the strain of an intense football season that ended in crushing disappointment for Aaron.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Perhaps if Rodgers had led the Packers to another Super Bowl like he&#8217;d planned, he and Shailene might have ridden off into the sunset together.</p>
<p>As it is, however, it sounds like they parted ways on pretty messy terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year with all the drama that Aaron put on the Green Bay Packers with trade demands and just being difficult with management really put Aaron&rsquo;s focus on making it right,&quot; <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/02/17/shailene-woodley-aaron-rodgers-breakup-reasons-taken-for-granted/">a source </a>close to the situation tells Hollywood Life by way of explanation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;He wanted to get to and win the Super Bowl, he wanted to be the league&rsquo;s MVP and that made his main focus his career.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Aaron accomplished the latter goal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it sounds like he might have alienated Shailene in the process.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;But the person who didn&rsquo;t get the focus was Shailene,&rdquo; the insider continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was doing her own thing for her career and just wanted more support from Aaron that just didn&rsquo;t happen,&quot; they added.</p>
<p>&quot;She wanted to have him be more present and invested in her and the relationship and it didn&rsquo;t happen. She thought she was taken for granted and it led to the [downfall of the] romance.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Another insider confirmed that Shailene was unhappy with the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Shailene is supportive of Aaron&rsquo;s career, he put football first and they were barely spending any time together,&rdquo; a source close to the situation told In Touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She felt he neglected their relationship. Neither of them was happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interestingly, despite Woodley&#8217;s apparent frustration with her partner&#8217;s priorities, it seems that it was Rodgers who called it quits.</p>
<p>The In Touch source says that Rodgers isn an &ldquo;independent guy&rdquo; who &ldquo;got cold feet&rdquo; about his impending nuptials to Shailene.</p>
<p>In the end, the tipster claims that in the and, despite their mutual affecrion, the two just &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t make it work.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;There were too many obstacles. They&rsquo;re both adults and decided to part amicably,&quot; this person claims.</p>
<p>Well, Rodgers&#8217; ignorance about infectious diseases means that he&#8217;s sure catch all sorts ot things, but in the end, it seems he just couldn&#8217;t catch feelings for Shailene!</p>
<p>We kid, anti-vaxxers!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>As it turns out,&nbsp;Aaron Rodgers is not immune to getting his heart broken.</p>
<p>According to multiple outlets, the NFL quarterback &#8212; who made headlines this past season for misleading the public about his COVID vaccination status &#8212; has split from fiancee&nbsp;Shailene Woodley after two years of romance.</p>
<p>No word yet on exactly what transpired.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>TMZ reports, however, that the relationship is most definitely over &quot;for good,&quot; just about 12 months after agreeing to get married.</p>
<p>Based on In Touch Weekly&#8217;s reporting, meanwhile, the 30-year old actress is the one who pulled the relationship plug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Shailene is supportive of Aaron&rsquo;s career, he put football first and they were barely spending any time together,&rdquo; an insider tells this tabloid, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She felt he neglected their relationship. Neither of them was happy.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The celebrities started seeing each other shortly after the signal-caller split from racing superstar Danica Patrick in July 2020.</p>
<p>The couple weren&#8217;t shy about their courtship, either, especially not early on, packing on major public displays of affection during trips to Disneyland and Mexico.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Rodgers even said he was looking forward to parenthood with Woodley.</p>
<p>&quot;I just think it&#8217;d be so fun,&quot; Rodgers said at the time. &quot;I&#8217;ve dreamt about what that would be like and I&#8217;m really excited about that chapter whenever that comes.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Woodley, meanwhile, was nothing but supportive over the past several months&#8230; as Rodgers faced harsh criticism for strongly hinting in a press conference that he had taken the COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>He later came down with the virus, however, and was forced to admit that he actually was NOT immunized against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News outlets STILL grasping at straws to disparage Aaron,&quot;&nbsp;Woodley Tweeted after some members of the paparazzi thought they had spotted the baller going out to get coffee.</p>
<p>The actress also <a href="/2021/11/shailene-woodley-launches-bizarre-tirade-on-instagram-aaron-rodg/">implied that Rodgers had a big penis</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speculation over the couple&#8217;s status, however, reached its apex last week after Rodgers earned his second consecutive Most Valuable Player Award.</p>
<p>In 2021, the quarterback surprised many observers after he mentioned during his speech <a href="/2021/02/aaron-rodgers-engaged-probably-to-shailene-woodley/">that he was engaged</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward a year later, though?</p>
<p>And Rodgers made no mention of Woodley at all in his subsequent speech after he won this trophy once again.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Instead, Rodgers thanked his &ldquo;inner circle &mdash; you know who you are&rdquo; for their &ldquo;love and support this season,&rdquo; as well as his &ldquo;Friday crew,&quot; saying:</p>
<p>&quot;I love you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Appearing on&nbsp;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last March, Woodley said of her stubborn, misguided and talented lover:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar.</p>
<p>&quot;When we met, also, I knew he was a football guy, but I didn&rsquo;t know like what kind of a football guy he was. And I&rsquo;m still constantly learning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As for where it all went wrong, the aforementioned In Touch source describes Rodgers as an &quot;independent&quot; person who got &quot;cold feet&quot; about marriage.</p>
<p>This celebrity gossip website describes him as a dangerous moron for saying on a podcast late last year of his decision not to get vaccinated:</p>
<p><em>I march to the beat of my own drum.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe strongly in bodily autonomy, [in the] ability to make choices for your body, not to have to acquiesce to some woke culture or crazed group of individuals who say you have to do something.</em></p>
