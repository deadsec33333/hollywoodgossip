<p>It seems inconceivable that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/steve-harvey-republican-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey</a> would ever retire from his gig as host of <em>Family Feud</em>. </p>



<p>Yet, if reports are to be believed, if he doesn&#8217;t rein in his behavior with contestants, he might see himself pushed out the door, whether he likes it or not.</p>



<p>While Steve&#8217;s hosting style has always been outlandish, producers are supposedly &#8220;concerned&#8221; that his behavior is crossing lines that even his charm can&#8217;t come back from.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-family-feud-execs-concerned-about-steve-harvey-s-behavior"> ‘Family Feud’ Execs ‘Concerned’ about Steve Harvey&#8217;s Behavior</h2>



<p>For over two decades, Steve Harvey has hosted <em>Family Feud</em> to the delight of fans around the world. His most devoted fans include everyone from Kanye West to Meagan Thee Stallion. </p>



<p>The latter appeared on the season premiere of <em>Celebrity Family Feud </em>in the fall of 2024 and her wild answer during the Fast Money sent Steve over the edge &#8211; in a good way. </p>



<p>But the same cannot be said of Steven during the regular play. In fact, more than once over the years, Steve has had a hard time hiding his annoyance with contestants who come up with &#8220;stupid&#8221; answers. Usually, the interactions he has with players is comical &#8212; but lately, things have taken a turn, according to those in the show&#8217;s inner circle.</p>



<p>“Steve’s king of the hill and has become an intrinsic part of the show’s success,&#8221; shared an insider with <em><a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/steve-harvey-has-family-feud-execs-concerned-after-outbursts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closer Weekly.</a></em> &#8220;But insulting contestants and calling their answers stupid right to their face is the last thing people need.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-he-be-pushed-to-retire-over-bad-behavior">Will He Be Pushed To Retire Over Bad Behavior?</h2>



<p>As of right now, fans can take a breath. There are no reports that Steve is considering retiring or that the show is forcing him to do anything &#8230; yet.</p>



<p>But the truth is, if Steve can&#8217;t control his emotions with contestants, he may find himself right behind <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/pat-sajak-bids-emotional-farewell-to-wheel-of-fortune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pat Sajak </a>as the next game show &#8220;pushed to retire&#8221;.</p>



<p>See, if the murmurs are to be believed, Pat was actually pushed out of <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> after four decades because of how irritable he was with players towards the end. </p>



<p>“Pat has put his foot in it one too many times and offended people with his off-color humor and temperamental behavior,” an&nbsp;<a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/wheel-of-fortune-pat-sajak-forced-out-bosses-complain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider told </a><em><a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/wheel-of-fortune-pat-sajak-forced-out-bosses-complain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OK!</a>&nbsp;</em>in the fall of 2023. “Network brass and top-level producers have come down hard on him and read him the riot act.”</p>



<p>By the following year, Pat was out as host, with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/ryan-seacrest-wheel-of-fortune-salary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Seacrest </a>set to replace him at the end of 2024. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-what-has-steve-in-such-a-mood">But What Has Steve In Such A Mood?</h2>



<p>Still, Steve being a curmudgeon with contestants over ridiculous answers is nothing new. It&#8217;s part of what makes the show entertaining. </p>



<p>Why, then, do execs feel like he&#8217;s crossing the line? And what&#8217;s going on with him that&#8217;s keeping him from recognizing that he&#8217;s towing that line?</p>



<p>To hear the <em>Closer</em> insider tell it, it has everything to do with his family. No, he isn&#8217;t getting a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-divorced-marriage-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce</a> &#8212; people love to talk about that &#8212; but there&#8217;s still some family drama he&#8217;s contending with.</p>



<p>“It’s got people around him panicky,&#8221; said the insider. &#8220;They’re concerned Steve’s working too hard. Maybe there’s pressure at home that’s getting to him and making him short-tempered.”</p>



<p>One of those pressures may be his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eldest daughter</a>, Lori Harvey, who has become a celebrity in her own right the last few years. </p>



<p>“Lori’s had a high-profile love life that seems to be going nowhere, and Steve wonders when she’ll ever settle down,” adds the insider. “Everyone’s hoping this is just a phase of his and not Sajak-gate all over again!”</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s hoping it all works out for him!</p>

<p>Steve Harvey is a divorced man &#8212; twice over, in fact. </p>



<p>The <em>Family Feud </em>host is no stranger to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/05/steve-harvey-lawsuit-ex-wife-alleges-mental-torture-soul-murderi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ugly divorces</a> and bitter, public battles. To that end, he isn&#8217;t immune to speculation and accusations about his current marriage. </p>



<p>In recent years, wild rumors have circulated about his relationship with Marjorie Harvey.</p>



<p>So, the real question is: Is Steve headed towards divorce number three? They&#8217;re saying absolutely not; their friends are saying otherwise.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-and-marjorie-harvey-open-up-on-divorce-rumors">Steve Harvey and Marjorie Harvey Open Up On Divorce Rumors </h2>



<p>Rumors have been circulating that claim that the famous yet <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/05/steve-harvey-yes-i-wrote-that-memo-no-im-not-sorry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial TV host</a> and his wife split due to multiple affairs on her part.</p>



<p>According to these claims, Marjorie Harvey&#8217;s alleged cheating included both the couple&#8217;s bodyguard and their chef.</p>



<p>The same rumors claim that this hurtful (yet impressive) betrayal has led to Marjorie demanding a divorce settlement of $200 million from Steve.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="699" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-1024x699.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey in October 2022." class="wp-image-497491" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-768x524.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-2048x1399.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-960x656.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-1080x737.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_02-1200x819.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey attends the second preseason NBA game between Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks at Etihad Arena on October 08, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Francois Nel/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are several problems with all of that. The <em>least </em>important of which may be that online estimates put Steve Harvey&#8217;s total net worth at around $200 million, which would make for a fairly lopsided divorce settlement.</p>



<p>In August of 2023, Steve Harvey appeared in person at the Atlanta business event, Invest Fest.</p>



<p>According to <em>The LA Times</em>, Steve Harvey quashed cheating and divorce rumors. And there&#8217;s even a video to go with it.</p>

<p>“I’m fine. Marjorie fine,” Steve Harvey declared to the crowd.</p>



<p>“I don’t know what y’all are doing, but find something else to do, ‘cause we fine. Lord, have mercy,&#8221; he remarked.</p>



<p>“Sometimes … you wanna respond, but I ain’t got no time for rumor and gossip,” Steve commented. “God been good to me. I’m still shining.”</p>

<p>Just weeks later, <em>The Economic Times</em> reported that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/is-steve-harvey-divorcing-his-wife-marjorie-comedian-fires-social-media-manager-amidst-divorce-rumours/articleshow/103107701.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey fired his social media manager</a>. </p>



<p>Some quickly connected it to the divorce rumors, but the TV host explained that it was the result of an uncharacteristically negative Tweet from the account.</p>



<p>“My husband and I don’t usually stop to address all the foolishness and lies that have been spread about us,” Marjorie Harvey acknowledged on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CweRt7fvsPT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “However to whom much is given much is required. I understand that with my platform comes some sort of responsibility to those that may not be as strong as we are.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-is-divorced-from-his-first-two-wives">Steve Harvey Is Divorced &#8211; From His First Two Wives </h2>



<p>Steve and Marjorie married in 2007. He has credited her with making him into a better person.</p>



<p>In 1996, he married Mary Harvey. Their marriage officially ended in December of 2005.</p>



<p>Before that, he married Marcia Harvey in 1981. They remained married until 1994.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="623" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-1024x623.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey in December of 2019." class="wp-image-497493" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-1024x623.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-300x183.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-768x467.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-2048x1246.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-960x584.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-1080x657.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0409_steveharvey_04-1200x730.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey speaks onstage during 2019 Miss Universe Pageant at Tyler Perry Studios on December 08, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Paras Griffin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Through three marriages, Steve Harvey has seven children &#8212; four biological and three by adoption. Three of his biological children were with his first wife, Marcia.</p>



<p>The two welcomed Brandi and Karli, twin daughters, on August 20 of 1982. Nine years later, on April 29, they welcomed their son, Broderick Harvey, Jr.</p>



<p>Steve Harvey is a very high-profile individual due to his career and success. His first wife, however, was not. As such, the reasons for their split were not immediately obvious.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-steve-harvey-get-divorced-from-marcia">Why did Steve Harvey get divorced from Marcia?</h2>



<p>Not everything that happens in the &#8217;90s remains in the &#8217;90s. Marcia Harvey&#8217;s 2011 book, <em>Marcia: Eyes to the Soul</em>, reflected upon her years married to Steve. </p>



<p>The public has now come to understand that Steve&#8217;s career kept him busy, and the time away from them caused a strain that led to a divorce.</p>



<p>Court records show that Steve did not initially pay alimony or child support to his ex-wife. After two years, Marcia went to court, where a judge forced the then-deadbeat to provide what he owed. Since then, Steve Harvey has patched things up with his ex-wife and with his children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-are-steve-amp-marjorie-today">How are Steve &amp; Marjorie Today</h2>



<p>These days, it feels like the pair have put the noise of a divorce behind them to enjoy living together. </p>



<p>In July 2024, the <em>Family Feud</em> host took to X, formerly Twitter, to post a <a href="https://x.com/IAmSteveHarvey/status/1808080892868583570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">photo</a> of him and his wife from their romantic getaway in Italy, where they celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary.</p>



<p>&#8220;Still going strong,&#8221; he wrote in the caption, along with fire and heart emojis. The pair looked incredibly cozy and incredibly chic, sitting together in formal wear while cruising the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>Looks like they&#8217;ll make it after all!  </p>

<p>Steve Harvey put a stop to a cuddly moment between two celebrity contestants, and it&#8217;s cracking up fans.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/family-feud-canceled-inappropriate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Family Feud</em>&#8216;s &#8220;spicy&#8221; questions</a> are too much for pearl-clutching viewers, <em>some </em>flirty moments are all about the guests.</p>



<p>On a recent episode of <em>Celebrity Family Feud</em>, Sherri Shepherd faced off against Shaquille O&#8217;Neal.</p>



<p>It fell to host Steve Harvey to play the &#8220;blocker&#8221; and separate them before a lingering hug turned into PDA.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-had-to-interrupt-some-celebrity-family-feud-flirting">Steve Harvey had to interrupt some &#8216;Celebrity Family Feud&#8217; flirting</h2>



<p>During a recent holiday special of <em>Celebrity Family Feud</em>, actress and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/wendy-williams-replaced-by-sherri-shepherd-thats-show-biz-but-il/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talk show host</a> Sherri Shepherd and her team faced off against sports legend Shaquille O&#8217;Neal.</p>



<p>As usual, Steve Harvey called the two to the podium, like opposing attorneys approaching the bench in court.</p>



<p>However, instead of getting to survey them right away, he had to wait. Sherri saw her chance and took it, going in for a hug.</p>

<p>At first, Sherri merely asked if she could shake hands with Shaq. Steve had no issue with that.</p>



<p>Sherri ended up embracing the NBA legend in a hug. Their height difference made this somewhat comical, as Sherri is only 5-foot-1 and Shaquille is a 7-foot-1. They represent extremes of the adult human height spectrum.</p>



<p>Additionally, Sherri was clearly savoring the moment. Her eyes closed, her face a mask of focused peace as if she were on a mattress commercial. Truly, living her best life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-steve-harvey-had-to-keep-everyone-on-track">But Steve Harvey had to keep everyone on track</h2>



<p>“Hey, hey, hey, hey &#8212; we got a game to play. Sherri, Sherri,” Steve told her.</p>



<p>As if jolted out of a blissful dream, Sherri darted back to her side of the podium.</p>



<p>A prolonged hug can sometimes be a deeply awkward moment. However, Shaq was clearly in good humor.</p>

<p>“Can I say one thing?” Shaq then asked Steve Harvey. “Once you go Shaq, you never go back. Be careful,” he joked, reciprocating Sherri&#8217;s flirtatious energy with his own.</p>



<p>“Once you go with Sherri, you gonna feel like the Tooth Fairy,&#8221; Sherri Shepherd replied. </p>



<p>That was more than enough for Steve, who reminded the two that he had a &#8220;little thing to do called <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/family-feud-prince-harry-diss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-the-first-time-that-sherri-and-shaq-have-flirted">This is not the first time that Sherri and Shaq have flirted</h2>



<p>As you can see in the clip above, Shaquille O&#8217;Neal and Sherri Shepherd have exchanged thirst back and forth over the years.</p>



<p>Honestly, knowing this may put some minds at ease. No one was harassing anyone, because this is part of their banter. It was also very tasteful, which makes sense. They are both professionals, rather than nervous first-time-on-camera contestants on the non-<em>Celebrity</em> iteration of <em>Family Feud</em>.</p>



<p>Steve Harvey had his work cut out with these two. But <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDWNp0Ux-kh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans</a> were eating it up &#8212; and cheering for Sherri.</p>

<p>With the election down to the wire, undecided voters are looking to their role models for guidance on who to vote for. </p>



<p>For some, that actually means checking in with their favorite celebrity to see where they stand. </p>



<p>People on both sides of the aisle were pretty sure Steve Harvey was a Republican and a supporter of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/donald-trump-mug-shot-released-indicted-ex-president-surrenders-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced former president Donald Trump</a> up until recently. </p>



<p>One damning, resurfaced video showed Harvey singing Trump&#8217;s praises. His defenders suggest that they were sarcastic. Others weren&#8217;t so convinced.</p>



<p>And then he sat down with Kamala and it felt like all the pieces were falling into place. So, if Steve Harvey&#8217;s political opinion means something to you, then this is what you should know. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-steve-harvey-a-republican-and-a-trump-supporter">Is Steve Harvey a Republican and a Trump supporter?</h2>



<p>Before we delve into the answers, we have to talk about why people are asking this about Steve Harvey.</p>



<p>2024 is an election year. Despite the criminal charges against him and his defeat in the 2020 elections, Donald Trump is running again. (To be fair, the criminal charges may be a <em>motivator </em>&#8212; as Supreme Court Justices whom he appointed could end up deciding whether occupying the Oval Office makes him immune to certain prosecutions.)</p>



<p>Because of this, finding famous supporters of Trump is both elusive and important, depending on who you ask.  Enter far-right influencers on social media, who have resurfaced a specific 2017 clip of Steve Harvey. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-divorced-marriage-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey&#8217;s career</a> has made him a familiar face, and whether it&#8217;s true or not, a political endorsement from him could hypothetically sway voters.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="699" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1024x699.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey in October of 2022." class="wp-image-500308" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-768x524.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-2048x1399.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-960x656.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1080x737.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_02-1200x819.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey attends the second preseason NBA game between Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks at Etihad Arena on October 08, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Francois Nel/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the &#8220;Ask Steve&#8221; clip from 2017, a woman in Steve Harvey&#8217;s audience asks him to help convince her husband to move to Sweden. She very memorably refers to the country as &#8220;the land of Ikea.&#8221;</p>



<p>She cited the appeal of Sweden &#8212; universal healthcare, free education, and a statistically long life expectancy. (She&#8217;s not wrong; Sweden also ranks very highly in terms of happiness)</p>



<p>As is Steve Harvey&#8217;s brand, his initial reaction was to make a silly face. He also cracked a joke about healthcare costs that one incurs from assembling Ikea furniture at home. Then, however, things took a dark turn.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-said-some-alarming-things-about-donald-trump">Steve Harvey said some alarming things about Donald Trump</h2>



<p>“Donald Trump is not gonna be that bad,&#8221; Steve Harvey said on camera in 2017. &#8220;Don’t run.&#8221;</p>



<p>He then claimed, perhaps in jest: &#8220;He’s gonna make Ikea bring they ass over here and start building them desks and stuff in America.&#8221;</p>



<p>Worst of all, Harvey then grew louder in volume and cited the campaign slogan: &#8220;‘Cause he’s gonna make America great again! Let’s go, Donald Trump.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we mentioned, some of Steve Harvey&#8217;s defenders have insisted that his words were dripping in sarcasm.</p>



<p>But, clearly, not everyone agrees with that. </p>



<p>From Twitter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/1b4etzb/resurfaced_clip_of_steve_harvey_telling_woman_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Reddit</a>, Steve Harvey&#8217;s critics and (former) fans have taken to replies to express their disappointment and disgust.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really and truly Steve Harvey I&#39;ve been a fan for quite some time but this display of ignorance has completely lost me never again will I ever devote a second of time to your ignorant butt</p>&mdash; ????AriA Blush the Fabulussy???? ????

<p>Now, there is a solid argument to be made that any support Steve ever had for Trump is buried in the past, and even if he is a Republican, he stands as one of the courageous few to show their support for Kamala Harris. </p>



<p>Case in point: a week before the election, Steve invited Kamala onto his r<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/harris/transcript/kamala-harris-interview-steve-harvey-syndicated-radio-october-30-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adio show</a> to sing her praises and hopefully reach some of the undecided folks she so desperately needs. </p>



<p>&#8220;You and Governor Walz are fighting for a new way forward,&#8221; Steve said to Kamala.  &#8220;You&#8217;re talking about protecting reproductive freedoms for &#8212; for women, for strengthening our democracy, and you want every person to have an opportunity to get ahead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Knowing his audience well, he followed up his praise with an all too important question. </p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s focus on this, that I&#8217;ve never seen done in my life, you came up with a real plan to help Black Americans&#8230;specifically, you targeted African American men. I&#8217;ve never seen that in a &#8212; can you go over some of the points?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kamala&#8217;s answered with this:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="623" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1024x623.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey in early December of 2019." class="wp-image-500309" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1024x623.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-300x183.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-768x467.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-2048x1246.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-960x584.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1080x657.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0520_steveharvey_03-1200x730.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey speaks onstage during 2019 Miss Universe Pageant at Tyler Perry Studios on December 08, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Paras Griffin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;First of all, let me just tell you that I understand that &#8212; listen, I&#8217;m going to be and I &#8212; and I pledge to be a president for all Americans, but not all people have been affected by issues the same way. So, for example, in my agenda for Black men, it includes what we need to do around having a specific initiative that is about Black men&#8217;s health because I know that we have higher rates of colon cancer and prostate cancer, and I want to make sure we&#8217;re increasing education and screening for Black men, doing &#8212; understanding that sickle cell affects Black men at a higher rate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, she got even more specific.</p>



<p>&#8220;My plan is about knowing that Black families are 40 percent less likely to be homeowners. So, I&#8217;m going to make sure that we have $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers so they can just get their foot in the door and get on the path to living the dream of America, the American dream, which also is about being on the path to creating intergenerational wealth.&#8221;</p>



<p>And all of this really impressed Steve Harvey. </p>



<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve done my research, you know, and I really, really watched what you&#8217;ve been about and what you&#8217;ve done, I &#8212; I became more and more impressed, so has a lot of people, because it really came to the forefront. You know, when a lot of people were talking about, &#8220;Wow, I misunderstood this about her,&#8221; because, now, people have had a chance to do the research.&#8221;</p>



<p>And there it is. Maybe Steve is just one of the few to actually stand behind the line of &#8220;doing your own research&#8221; and getting behind a candidate that will look out for the many, not just the few. </p>

<p>Steve Harvey fans are WORRIED that the beloved TV personality may have been suspended!</p>



<p>Steve is one of the most beloved comedians on television. His roles hosting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/steve-harvey-retire-family-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shows like <em>Family Feud</em></a><em> </em>or <em>Judge Steve Harvey </em>have made him a star.</p>



<p>The former has been his bread and butter for YEARS! He&#8217;s beloved on the Feud and has given no hint of wanting to retire any time soon. So why in the world are people worried he&#8217;s been suspended?!</p>



<p>The rumor mill has been churning this week, that&#8217;s for sure&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="734" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520-734x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510821" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520-215x300.jpg 215w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520-768x1072.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520-688x960.jpg 688w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520-774x1080.jpg 774w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-826128520.jpg 860w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Steve Harvey at the NBCUniversal Summer TCA Press Tour at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on August 3, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rumor-has-it">Rumor Has It&#8230; </h2>



<p>It all started &#8211; where else &#8211; on social media! That&#8217;s where all the best rumors get started these days. </p>



<p>Remember Perez Hilton? Well, he  claimed that a TV personality was recently suspended in a viral TikTok video on October 3. Perez said that he was unsure if the info was true, but he&#8217;d &#8220;run with it as an unconfirmed rumor.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the rumor &#8220;could be wrong,&#8221; Perez said that he learned about a major suspension from a &#8220;friend who works in television.&#8221; He said that &#8220;word is traveling around Hollywood real quick.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@perezhilton25/video/7421322495556422942" data-video-id="7421322495556422942" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@perezhilton25" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@perezhilton25?refer=embed" rel="noopener">@perezhilton25</a> <p>????</p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Perez Hilton" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7421322458277399326?refer=embed" rel="noopener">♬ original sound &#8211; Perez Hilton</a> </section> </blockquote>



<p>Perez didn&#8217;t name who the scoop was about, but he did leave some breadcrumbs. &#8220;My source tells me that a very popular television personality, not an actor or actress. This TV personality, male, the host of a show, just got suspended,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>As for further details, Perez explained &#8220;nobody knows why&#8221; and that it is &#8220;bad timing&#8221; for the person. The blogger continued and said that he had &#8220;something else big going on.&#8221; </p>



<p>Perez did offer a clue by sharing a bell emoji. In the comments, many fans speculated that he was speaking about Steve Harvey. Perez even &#8220;liked&#8221; one comment. The clip currently has over 4 million views.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely Steve Harvey,&#8221; one fan wrote. &#8220;We need another hint. Does the host ever say, &#8216;survey says&#8217;?&#8221; another follower commented.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-why-would-steve-havey-be-suspended">But Why Would Steve Havey Be Suspended?</h2>



<p>As Perez noted, this is a rumor and has not been confirmed. Despite being unconfirmed, some fans have begun sharing theories about why Steve Harvey was suspended, and why the timing is bad.</p>



<p>One fan commented that the <em>Family Feud </em>host is currently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-divorced-marriage-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going through a divorce</a>, but there are no reports that Steve is breaking up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with his wife</a> Marjorie. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve seen online that Steve Harvey’s wife is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/05/steve-harvey-sneakily-selling-off-assets-ahead-of-divorce-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing for divorce. </a>That would be the big thing that isn’t work related,&#8221; one person wrote.</p>

Harvey (@marjorie_harvey)</a></p></div></blockquote>



<p>Even though divorce rumors occasionally pop up for the couple, they appear to still be going strong! The pair posted a romantic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_TZWm4IhDj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> of them holding hands on the beach at sunset in August. </p>



<p>Following the video, someone also speculated that Steve had fled the country in connection with Diddy&#8217;s criminal charges. The rapper is currently awaiting trial for racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rumors are swirling that Steve Harvey got suspended from his show and his wife recently filed for divorce,&#8221; one person wrote on X (formerly Twitter). &#8220;Is this a fallout from P Diddy? Or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/08/steve-harvey-accused-of-harassing-stalking-bullying-essie-berry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pure coincidence?&#8221;</a></p>



<p>This rumor is also false. Despite gaining some traction, it <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/fact-check-did-steve-harvey-flee-country-aftermath-diddy-s-arrest-viral-youtube-headline-explored" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been debunked</a>, according to <em>Sportske</em>eda. There are no verified reports indicating that Steve has left the United States. He also has not been named in any reports about Diddy&#8217;s charges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-theories">Other Theories</h2>



<p>Steve was not the only person that people guessed the rumor was about. Other comments on Perez&#8217;s video named included Ryan Seacrest, Mario Lopez, Andy Cohen, Carson Daly, and others.</p>



<p>People suggested that the bell hint may have been a reference to Mario&#8217;s role on <em>Saved By the Bell</em>. Some also suggested that it was a reference to the buzzers on <em>The Voice</em>, which Carson hosts. </p>



<p>Despite much speculation, the rumors has not been confirmed. Perez has not revealed who the rumor was about nor has he confirmed it. &#8220;Hopefully I&#8217;m right, and if I&#8217;m not, then just embarrassing to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mention anybody&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Should <em>Family Feud</em> be canceled? Has it finally crossed a line?! </p>



<p>That&#8217;s what some of the show&#8217;s long-time fans are saying after a recent, viral clip.</p>



<p>Though the competition series is a key part of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-divorced-marriage-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey</a>&#8216;s image and is often full of laughs, some of the questions may go too far.</p>



<p>How NSFW can the show get before it needs to drop &#8220;Family&#8221; from the title?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-1024x576.png" alt="Steve Harvey on Family Feud." class="wp-image-505226" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Family Feud, Steve Harvey hears his share of impulsive and at times inappropriate answers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-family-feud-is-a-game-show-in-which-family-groups-compete">&#8216;Family Feud&#8217; is a game show in which family groups compete</h2>



<p>The formula is simple. Teams face off, answering questions that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/steve-harvey-republican-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">host Steve Harvey</a> asks. </p>



<p>These are not off-the-cuff questions. Producers came up with them and already know how people might reply.</p>



<p>Producers have already surveyed 100 others &#8212; people who are not contestants &#8212; for their answers. If the contestant&#8217;s answer matches (more or less) with what people told producers, their team advances.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_02-575x1024.png" alt='A vertical Family Feud screenshot with the word "package" captioned.' class="wp-image-505219" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_02-575x1024.png 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_02-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_02-539x960.png 539w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_02.png 605w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">What might a woman stare at on a man? &#8220;Package,&#8221; suggests one Family Feud contestant.

<p>Okay, it&#8217;s slightly more complex than that. But not by much.</p>



<p>Producers obviously phrase questions so that people can have innocuous replies and comical ones. And sometimes, the potential for comedy might be somewhat NSFW in nature. (Other times, answers can be unexpectedly sweet)</p>



<p>As you can see below, a recent clip asked contestants: “Men stare at women’s boobs. What do men have that women stare at??&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="574" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_03-574x1024.png" alt="A vertical screenshot of Steve Harvey on Family Feud." class="wp-image-505220" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_03-574x1024.png 574w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_03-168x300.png 168w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_03-538x960.png 538w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_03.png 603w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Family Feud, host Steve Harvey often elicits laughter with his reactions to answers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-about-their-package">&#8216;How about their package?&#8217;</h2>



<p>One <em>Family Feud</em> contestant, Celeste, offers an obvious answer with some very tasteful phrasing. “How about their package?” she asks in the video.</p>



<p>Celeste is not referring to a delivery driver, but to clothed genitals. Her euphemism counted as an answer, one that producers had summarized as &#8220;an adorable dong.&#8221; It was one of the top four answers.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Celeste also answered &#8212; on behalf of her team &#8212; &#8220;feet.&#8221; Host Steve Harvey was quick to connect this to a <em>probable </em>urban legend about foot size corresponding to genital size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="What do men have that women stare at? #shorts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z0wK88Xwa-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>To be clear, no part of this was Celeste&#8217;s fault. She guessed &#8212; and she guessed correctly. That&#8217;s how the show works.</p>



<p>And, clearly, production assumed that many of the replies would be thirsty in nature. They assumed correctly.</p>



<p>However, given that <em>Family Feud</em>&#8216;s audience often involves actual family members with a large range of ages and cultural backgrounds, the clip isn&#8217;t going over so well on some parts of social media.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="578" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_04-578x1024.png" alt="A vertical screenshot of Family Feud's answer board." class="wp-image-505221" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_04-578x1024.png 578w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_04-169x300.png 169w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_04-542x960.png 542w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0801_familyfeud_04.png 604w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Some of Family Feud&#8217;s answers, all of which come from surveys, can be a little spicy.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-family-feud-should-be-canceled-insist-critics-of-nsfw-answers">&#8216;Family Feud&#8217; Should be Canceled, Insist Critics Of NSFW Answers </h2>



<p>Various <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@familyfeud/video/7396400553263172895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> users took to the comments to ask if Family Feud has run its course. The show seems to have grown too heavy-handed in its attempt to create these viral, NSFW moments.</p>



<p>“This used to be a family show,” one TikTok denizen commented. “I couldn’t watch this with my grandma anymore.”</p>



<p>Another joked that the series is &#8220;taking family out of family [feud].&#8221; (Though, just for the record, the show gets its name from contestant families. It&#8217;s not about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/steve-harvey-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey&#8217;s family</a> or which age ranges might enjoy the series)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@familyfeud/video/7395683431465635103" data-video-id="7395683431465635103" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@familyfeud" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@familyfeud?refer=embed">@familyfeud</a> <p>Something of yours that always seems to be growing?? 🤔🍆🤔 Gordon stuns SteveHarvey! <a title="familyfeud" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/familyfeud?refer=embed">#FamilyFeud</a></p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ GROWING - Family Feud" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/GROWING-7395683420388494111?refer=embed">♬ GROWING &#8211; Family Feud</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Many shows, both scripted and reality series, sometimes lean in too heavily upon specific elements. In this case, people replying to very innocent questions with NSFW answers created viral moments.</p>



<p>Perhaps production is leaning too heavily into that. This sort of thing can get old, with time.</p>



<p>That said, to put this as delicately as possible &#8230; if someone can&#8217;t handle a euphemism as vague as &#8220;package,&#8221; perhaps that&#8217;s their issue. Maybe that&#8217;s not <em>Family Feud</em>&#8216;s fault.</p>

<p>In addition to his roles as a beloved comedian and game show host, Steve Harvey is a father to seven kids.</p>



<p>Steve credits his successful career to his family and says that his children are his primary motivation for continuing to work hard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Family is my reason why,&#8221; he once told <em><a href="https://people.com/parents/all-about-steve-harvey-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> magazine. &#8220;I work to leave a legacy and hopefully [make] the world a better place for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We knew this was right. Now we&#8217;re Mom and Dad to everybody.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steve-harvey-s-kids-who-are-they">Steve Harvey&#8217;s Kids: Who Are They?</h2>



<p>Steve&#8217;s eldest kids, twin girls, <strong>Brandi and Karli</strong>, 40, and son <strong>Broderick Harvey Jr.,</strong> 31, are from his first marriage.</p>



<p>(Yeah, that&#8217;s right. You probably didn&#8217;t know that Steve&#8217;s real first name is Broderick!)</p>



<p>Steve was working as an insurance salesman when he first became a dad. After winning money in a standup competition, he decided to quit his job in order to focus on comedy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="703" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-578965774-1024x703.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey speaks at the State Farm Color Full Lives Art Gallery during the 2016 State Farm Neighborhood Awards at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on July 22, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<p>&#8220;Years later, they said to me, &#8216;Dad, we didn&#8217;t understand why you left us, but we know now you had to go,'&#8221; Steve once told <em>People</em>.</p>



<p> &#8220;&#8216;You didn&#8217;t just belong to us. You belonged to the world.&#8217; That was emotional for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Steve&#8217;s fourth child, <strong>Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey</strong>, 26, was a product of his marriage to his second wife, Mary Shackelford.</p>



<p>Steve and Mary divorced in 2005 after nine years of marriage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-harvey-family-grows-larger">The Harvey Family Grows Larger</h2>



<p>In 2007, Steve married Marjorie Harvey and adopted her three children, <strong>Morgan Hawthorne</strong>, 38, <strong>Jason Harvey,</strong> 31, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/prince-michael-sorry-for-spilling-all-that-lori-harvey-sex-tea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lori Harvey</a>, 27.</p>



<p>Lori has launched a successful career as a model and influencer.</p>



<p>In addition to walking the runway for such esteemed fashion labels as Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Burberry, she&#8217;s built a massive fan base on social media, with more than 5 million followers on Instagram alone.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-1024x682.jpg" alt='Lori Harvey attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An Anthology of Fashion" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.' class="wp-image-498819" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1395050999-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lori Harvey attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;In America: An Anthology of Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But while Lori is the child who&#8217;s most clearly following in her father&#8217;s footsteps, we&#8217;re sure that Steve is equally proud of all of his kids.</p>



<p>Over the years, the Harveys have gained a reputation as a happy, close-knit clan.</p>



<p>And the road to this life began when Steve quit his job in order to try and build a better life for his family.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s one gamble that&#8217;s paid off big time!</p>

<p>Your first divorce can throw you for a loop, but <a href="/2017/05/steve-harvey-lawsuit-ex-wife-alleges-mental-torture-soul-murderi/">Steve Harvey knows what it&#8217;s like to have an ex-wife</a>. He has two.</p>



<p>As he gears up for a rumored third divorce, he&#8217;s making <em>sure </em>to not repeat past mistakes.</p>



<p>According to a new report, the television host is liquidating millions of dollars worth of property to keep it out of his wife&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p><a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/05/steve-harvey-unloads-four-texas-homes-ahead-dirty-divorce-war/"><em>RadarOnline</em></a> reports that Steve Harvey is selling off property left and right.</p>



<p>Since January of this eyar, the<em> Family Feud</em> host has placed four different properties for sale in Texas.</p>



<p>Two of those properties have already sold.</p>



<p>He has made an estimated $2 million.</p>



<p>And it seems like it&#8217;s only a matter of time before the other two properties follow in those footsteps.</p>

<p>The report says that Harvey has also fiddled with the ownership of another property.</p>



<p>He has allegedly transferred ownership to himself, where previously he owned it alongside wife Marjorie.</p>



<p>This imminent divorce battle comes on the heels of additional bad news &#8212; this time of a professional nature.</p>



<p>The controversial television personality has learned that NBC Universal will no longer be broadcasting his talk show.</p>



<p>At present, he&#8217;s worth a whopping <em>nine </em>figures, but the report warns that this could endanger his $200 million business empire.</p>

<p>Steve has been married to Marjorie since 2007.</p>



<p>But it sounds like experience has taught him to not count on sentimentality when it comes to preserving his assets in a divorce.</p>



<p>&#8220;Steve learned a lesson from his drawn-out divorce from [second wife] Mary,&#8221; an insider explains.</p>



<p>According to the source, &#8220;It took him years to get their properties into his name&#8221;</p>



<p>He won&#8217;t be doing that again &#8212; not if he can help it.</p>



<p>Cash is just easier to distribute, if ordered by the court or agreed upon by the divorcing parties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marjorie would never allow herself to be pushed around,&#8221; an insider characterizes. &#8220;Money talks and her man had better provide.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And when the money’s gone, she’s gone, too!&#8221; the source expresses.</p>



<p>Marjorie recently took her daughter, whom Steve adopted, on a month-long world tour.</p>



<p>&#8220;Steve is desperate to stay on television,&#8221; the insider says. &#8220;He supports all six of their children in fine style and Marjorie is blowing through his cash.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He’s even admitted to pals that he needs to work things out with her or he’ll be left with nothing, which is insane,&#8221; the source opines.</p>



<p>The insider notes: &#8220;He’s been on TV for 25 years!&#8221;</p>

<p>So what went wrong in the first place?</p>



<p>If sources can be believed, part of the problem was that Steve flirted with Kris Jenner.</p>



<p>&#8220;Steve has a wandering eye,&#8221; the source says.</p>



<p>&#8220;He cheated during his previous marriages,&#8221; the insider points out. &#8220;And Marjorie knows he could do it again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She knows her man’s weakness,&#8221; the source points out. &#8220;Knows everything about him!&#8221;</p>



<p>After 12 years of marriage, we would imagine so.</p>

<p>Steve Harvey has been controversial, at times with justification and at other times over comments that bore no malice.</p>



<p>(I certainly cannot speak for Asian men or for atheists or absolve his wrongdoing on behalf of those communities, but a few <em>other </em>controversies could have been avoided)</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s seldom cause of celebration to hear that a marriage is ending.</p>



<p>We should note that it doesn&#8217;t look like Steve is necessarily trying to hide money or assets so much as he is trying to streamline things.</p>



<p>More importantly, Steve and Marjorie continue to deny that they&#8217;re getting divorced.</p>



<p>In fact, they&#8217;ve recently been attending events together in a very public manner. What is the truth?</p>

<p>Things got seriously heated during&nbsp;<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/02/13/monique-steve-harvey-fight-blackballed-oprah/">Mo&#8217;Nique and Steve Harvey&#8217;s highly anticipated interview</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News quickly spread that the actress actually &#8220;slapped&#8221; Steve in the face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while that rumor was wrong, it wasn&#8217;t far fetched.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="759" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-759x1024.jpg" alt="Mo'Nique pic" class="wp-image-246202" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-759x1024.jpg 759w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-222x300.jpg 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-768x1036.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-1138x1536.jpg 1138w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-1518x2048.jpg 1518w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-735x992.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-248x335.jpg 248w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-257x347.jpg 257w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-385x520.jpg 385w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-474x640.jpg 474w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-569x768.jpg 569w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-711x960.jpg 711w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-800x1080.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/monique-pic-scaled.jpg 1897w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>During <a href="/2017/05/steve-harvey-to-talk-show-staff-stay-away-from-me/">an all-new <em>Steve</em></a>, the talk show host invited his long-time friend onto the show to address some negative headlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mo&#8217;Nique and Steve went head-to-head on the comedienne&#8217;s comments over Oprah, Lee Daniels and Tyler Perry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And according to <em>HollywoodLife</em>, &#8220;Mo goes as far to say she was getting ready to punch Steve in the mouth.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="874" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-874x1024.jpg" alt="Steve Harvey Sort of Sucks" class="wp-image-265368" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-874x1024.jpg 874w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-256x300.jpg 256w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-768x899.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-1312x1536.jpg 1312w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-1749x2048.jpg 1749w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-735x861.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-286x335.jpg 286w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-296x347.jpg 296w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-444x520.jpg 444w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-547x640.jpg 547w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-656x768.jpg 656w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-820x960.jpg 820w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-sort-of-sucks-922x1080.jpg 922w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The two&#8217;s debate intensified over her comments about being &#8220;blackballed&#8221; from movies and how she even told Daniels, Perry and Oprah to &#8220;suck my d***&#8221; during a stand-up show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but how do you say such things about Oprah and not expect to get excluded from the film industry?&nbsp;</p>



<p>That rowdy behavior may get you a <a href="/2018/11/the-bachelor-spoilers-2019-colton-underwood-final-three-rose-cer/">rose on The Bachelor,</a> but not a lead role in a movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve gets right to it and asks: &#8220;You started getting labeled as difficult, why do you believe that happened and do you see that changing and why?&#8221;</p>



<p>She replies, &#8220;I said no to some very powerful people.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oscar-winner then went on to say she didn&#8217;t appreciate&nbsp;Steve&#8217;s handling of the situation after news broke that she was &#8220;blackballed from the industry.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said she was incredibly hurt when Steve reportedly said: &#8220;My sister burnt too many bridges and there&#8217;s nothing I can do for her now.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="914" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-1024x914.png" alt="Steve Harvey on Set" class="wp-image-264687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-1024x914.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-300x268.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-768x686.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-735x656.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-335x299.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-347x310.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-520x464.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-640x571.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set-960x857.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/steve-harvey-on-set.png 1027w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The TV host assured her and said he understands her anger towards his statement&nbsp;but also thought she &#8220;went about it all wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t cure darkness with more darkness,&#8221; he said to her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, Mo has claimed that she was blackballed by Hollywood after refusing to promote her film <em>Precious</em> without additional pay and she argued that some big names attempted to silence her during her pursuit of equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their tempered talk finally turned into a real conversation as <a href="/2017/01/steve-harvey-sorry-for-slamming-asians-as-ugly/">Steve apologized</a> for not calling her the moment he heard about the news.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here is what I want you to understand, as we try to come through this, I know who you really are, I want you to come through this,&#8221; the host said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you like a sister, I hate what is happening to you. I want them to know you are caring, a great mother, you are an incredible mother,&#8221; he continued, holding her hand and looking into her eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&nbsp;like the fact that you&#8217;ve been blackballed&#8230;I want this&nbsp;to end for you. Because I love you. Because these&nbsp;people are doing it the wrong way and you&#8217;re better than that.</p>



<p>&#8220;I probably should&#8217;ve called you as soon as it happened, but I didn&#8217;t. When I did, I listened to you, but I told you, in the beginning, we&#8217;re going about this the wrong way.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He summed up the issue by telling Mo&#8217;Nique that those people owe her an apology, but that she also owes them an apology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve also revealed that he would facilitate the conversation, bringing in all parties involved for a private (but probably not) open discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And their talk resolved with a promise that Steve will get her the release she desperately needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent weeks,<a href="/2018/03/wendy-williams-when-will-she-return-to-the-air/"> Wendy Williams has been struggling with health issues</a> that have prevented her from filming new episodes of her famously trashy talk show.</p>



<p>Steve Harvey longs for a future in which you could channel surf for hours and see nothing but Steve Harvey with maybe the occasional glimpse of Kenan Thompson doing a Steve Harvey impression thrown in for variety.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>What do these two facts have to do with one another?</p>



<p>Well, if a new report from Radar Online is to be believed, Wendy and Steve are embroiled in some sort of Shakespearean intrigue, and the media personality who emerges victorious will enjoy the coveted title of King or Queen of Syndicated Daytime Television.</p>



<p>A source tells the site that producers are desperate for someone to <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/02/steve-harvey-replace-wendy-williams-amid-health-crisis/">fill in for Wendy</a> while she&#8217;s on leave &#8212; and Steve believes he&#8217;s just the man for the job.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“Wendy’s fans are very particular. They didn’t take well to Don Lemon when he stepped in. He lasted just one week,” a production&nbsp;insider tells the site.</p>



<p>“It would take a very particular personality to step into Wendy’s shoes,&#8221; the insider adds.</p>



<p>“The Fox guys see Steve as a big enough name, and word in the industry is the way he’s been treated by NBC, he feels they don’t deserve him.&#8221;</p>

<p>That last comment refers to Harvey&#8217;s feeling that his current bosses are edging him out in favor of daytime newcomer Kelly Clarkson.</p>



<p>NBC has apparently given coveted timeslots to Clarkson in several major markets, a fact that Harvey is clearly not thrilled with.</p>



<p>As host of roughly 47 shows, Harvey obviously isn&#8217;t hurting for money, but those who know the host best say he has a competitive streak that cannot be contained.</p>

<p>“Steve is all about one thing — winning,” says the insider.</p>



<p>“He’s not going to let Kelly come out of nowhere, steal his time slot and get an easy ride.&#8221;</p>



<p>Harvey reportedly feels a partnership with Fox will take him back to the top, and sees Williams&#8217; show as an easy way to get his foot in the door.</p>

<p>“If he goes back to a show run by a big network, they will pump lots of money into it — and he thinks it will get him back on top of the TV ratings,&#8221; the insider says.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for Harvey, Williams and Clarkson are not his only competition.</p>



<p>Producers on Williams&#8217; show are reportedly favoring Nick Cannon as a younger, hipper option.</p>



<p>Let the battle for daytime&nbsp;supremacy begin!</p>
