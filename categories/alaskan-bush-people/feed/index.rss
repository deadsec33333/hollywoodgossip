<p>Will the Brown family ever return to our TV screens? It seems increasingly unlikely.</p>



<p>Discovery has not aired new episodes of <em>Alaskan Bush People</em> since 2022, and there are signs that the show has been quietly canceled after 14 seasons.</p>



<p>That news isn&#8217;t terribly surprising, coming, as it does, years after the<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/02/billy-brown-dead-at-68-alaskan-bush-people-mourn-family-patriarc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> death of star Billy Brown</a> and the filing of an increasingly messy lawsuit.</p>



<p>Fans are still upset by the latest developments in this sad story, but Bear Brown is offering them a glimmer of hope.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-discovery-canceled-alaskan-bush-people">Has Discovery canceled &#8216;Alaskan Bush People&#8217;?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s get the big question out of the way right off the bat:</p>



<p>No, Discovery has not officially announced the cancelation of <em>Alaskan Bush People</em>. But it seems like such an announcement might be coming soon. Or is it?</p>



<p>Usually, when a reality show is off the air for this long, it&#8217;s over and done with, but Bear Brown insists that that&#8217;s not the case this time.</p>



<p>“The official term for the show is that it is on hiatus,” he said in a new Instagram video, adding:</p>

<p>“So, like, Discovery doesn’t really have any issues saying when a show’s canceled. They’ve canceled plenty of shows, and they normally announce it, and they’re like, ‘This show has been canceled,’ and they don’t mind saying that. But our show has not been canceled.”</p>



<p>Bear blamed the extended hiatus on Discovery’s “super big merger a few years ago,” explaining that the network is “still getting their ducks in a row.”</p>



<p>But while Bear seems hopeful about the possibility of the show&#8217;s return, there&#8217;s still reason for doubt.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1180765/has-alaskan-bush-people-been-canceled-season-15-discovery-channel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Insider</a> notes, the show is no longer listed on the Discovery Channel&#8217;s media page as one of the network&#8217;s properties.</p>

<p>Many fans assumed that the show would come to an end following Billy&#8217;s death. But according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/13743107/alaskan-bush-people-canceled-fourteen-seasons-show-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>, it wasn&#8217;t Billy&#8217;s passing, but his legal entanglements that brought about the end of ABP.</p>



<p>Two months after Billy&#8217;s passing, a former business partner named <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/ami-brown-claps-back-at-alaskan-bush-people-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Maughon filed a breach of contract lawsuit </a>against the late star’s estate and business, Alaskan Wilderness Family Productions.</p>



<p>He alleged that Billy had agreed to pay him 10 percent “of the gross income of Alaska Wilderness Family Productions from the creative works of Billy Bryan Brown, specifically including books, movies, television and documentaries.”</p>



<p>The suit threatened to wrangle Discovery into this messy legal battle, which might be one reason that the network decided to cut ties with the Browns.</p>

<p>“These breaches occurred despite the significant profits generated by [Alaskan Wilderness Family Productions], particularly through the television series Alaskan Bush People which was featured on the Discovery Channel network,&#8221; reads one portion of the filing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-suit-contains-clues-that-alaskan-bush-people-has-come-to-an-end">The suit contains clues that &#8216;Alaskan Bush People&#8217; has come to an end</h2>



<p>As <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/13743107/alaskan-bush-people-canceled-fourteen-seasons-show-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em> reports, the wording in the lawsuit seems to indicate that ABP has concluded its run on Discovery.</p>



<p>“Testimony acknowledging that the show Alaskan Bush People ultimately had 14 seasons, with the last season being filmed in 2022,” one portion reads.</p>



<p>The documents repeatedly refer to the series in the past tense, with one portion reading:</p>

<p>“These breaches occurred despite the significant profits generated by [Alaskan Wilderness Family Productions], particularly through the television series ‘Alaskan Bush People’ which was featured on the Discovery Channel network.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for a long-running show to be revived by a new network. But that seems unlikely in the case of a series whose most beloved cast member passed away several years ago.</p>



<p>Yes, fans said goodbye to Billy quite some time ago. And now, it looks like it might be time to say goodbye to <em>Alaskan Bush People</em>.</p>

<p>Even with the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/bear-brown-i-will-never-reconcile-with-my-brother/">brotherly feuds within the <em>Alaskan Bush People</em> family</a>, not all conflict happens among siblings.</p>



<p>Almost two years ago, an unhappy investor filed a lawsuit against the estate of the late Billy Brown.</p>



<p>Publicly, we haven&#8217;t heard much from the Brown family. That is advisable for most touchy legal matters.</p>



<p>Now, however, Ami is publicly clapping back at the lawsuit &#8212; and defending her late husband.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/6844749/alaskan-bush-people-billy-brown-wife-ami-slams-lawsuit/"><em>The Sun</em> reports</a> that, in early 2021, an investor filed a breach of contract lawsuit.</p>



<p>Robert Maughon is the name of the investor in question.</p>



<p>The lawsuit targets both Billy Brown&#8217;s estate and Alaskan Wilderness Family Productions, which was his production company.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ami Brown and Billy Brown are doing&#8230; something in this GIF of the couple from the Alaskan Bush People premiere.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Maughon claimed in the lawsuit that Billy Brown neglected to pay him <em>Alaskan Bush People</em> profits.</p>



<p>His claim is twofold: both that Billy owed him these monies and that he never received them.</p>



<p>Ami has now responded, issuing her own formal response in court to dispute these allegations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-1024x570.png" alt="Alaskan Bush People, Family Photo" class="wp-image-309055" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-1024x570.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-300x167.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-768x428.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-735x409.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-335x187.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-347x193.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-520x290.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-640x357.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-960x535.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo-1080x602.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/09/alaskan-bush-people-family-photo.png 1244w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alaskan Bush People stars, from left to right: Noah Brown, Ami Brown, Bird Brown, Billy Brown, Rain Brown, Bear Brown, Bam Bam Brown, and Matt Brown.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Plaintiff made no demands for breach or damages until 2014,&#8221; Ami&#8217;s legal response reads.</p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the filing continues, &#8220;at that time making demand on the alleged January 25, 2009 contract.&#8221;</p>



<p>The document goes on: &#8220;But not on the alleged January 6, 2009 contract, and thereafter unreasonably delaying action or communication with Billy Bryan Brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>This filing cites: &#8220;again presenting demands and filing legal action in 2021 only after the death of Billy Bryan Brown.&#8221;</p>



<p>And the document then points out: &#8220;who could not then defend the matter with his own testimony.&#8221; </p>



<p>The late patriarch&#8217;s estate is requesting a jury trial for the lawsuit, and asking that the plaintiff cover all attorney costs.</p>

<p>A settlement meeting is currently set for March of 2023. </p>



<p>That is only four months away.</p>



<p>Requesting a jury trial is complicated. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="714" height="694" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow.png" alt="Ami Brown in the Snow" class="wp-image-289645" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow.png 714w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow-300x292.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow-335x326.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow-347x337.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow-520x505.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/ami-brown-in-the-snow-640x622.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ami Brown looks cold despite her layers in the snow.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, it means that one feels more confidence in an emotional appeal than in a cold reading of a legal case. </p>



<p>One can imagine how a widow and cancer-surviving widow might be sympathetic to a jury. Or to anyone.</p>



<p>At the same time, the entire foundation of the jury system is the hope that twelve peers can reasonably decide whether Maughon is entitled to a share of Billy Brown&#8217;s estate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the first season, Billy said the government burned down his family’s cabin because it was &#8220;in the wrong location on public land.&#8221; But there&#8217;s no evidence this happened and Brown changed his tune on season two, simply saying the cabin burned down when he wasn&#8217;t home.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, being part of a beloved reality TV family does not make the Browns automatically in the right. Of course, being the subjects of a lawsuit does not make them automatically wrong.</p>



<p>It will be up to the court to decide these matters and more.</p>



<p>Though an out of court settlement is always possible &#8212; however unlikely it seems as this point.</p>

<p>We have an update on two of the Alaskan Bush People.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Bear Brown posted a video on social media that described Alaskan Bush People &#8212; the reality show that focused on Bear and his relatives living mostly off the grid &#8212; as a unifying program.</p>



<p>He said in this footage that the series featured a “family coming together in adversity” and “supporting one another.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Wait a minute, though.</p>



<p>In the comment section of Bear’s post, at least one fan tried to almost use Bear&#8217;s words again him. </p>



<p>This follower cited Bear&#8217;s &#8220;stray brother&#8221; and asked when he&#8217;ll get brought back into the family fold.</p>



<p>In response, Bear insisted that Matt doesn’t want be part of the family &#8230; and that his sibling is the one to blame for the estrangement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I’m getting tired of people acting like it’s us!” Bear fired back. “Why take his word over the whole family[‘s]? It makes no sense!”</p>



<p>He even proceeded to accuse Matt of spreading lies about their late father, Billy Brown, along with other members of the famous family.</p>



<p>“You talk about someone who has not ever apologized for the things he’s done!&#8221; Bear continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;Someone who spoke lies about his own dad after he died a dad that was ALWAYS there for him.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Matt Brown left Alaskan Bush People after Season 8.</p>



<p>He entered rehab for alcohol addiction in 2016 and has been estranged from his parents for the duration of his substance abuse issues.</p>



<p>When the Browns moved from Alaska to Washington in 2018, Matt elected to stay in California, where he had sought treatment. </p>



<p>The decision further distanced him from his family &#8212; and he entered rehab for a second time later that year following allegations from two different women that he had sexually assaulted them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>In March, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/bear-brown-alaskan-bush-people-star-arrested-for-domestic-violen/">Bear was arrested for domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>Via the aforementioned video a couple days ago, Bear referred to Matt as “someone who continues to speak lies about his family, his mother, his brothers and sisters! </p>



<p>&#8220;If you knew the truth about him I guarantee you would not support him! </p>



<p>&#8220;He abandoned his family NOT the other way around!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>in April 2021, Matt accused parents Ami and the late Billy Brown of not compensating him for appearing on the Discovery Channel program, claiming his parents stole $360,000 from him.</p>



<p>“We made a lot of money off the show, and because my dad controlled everything, all the money went to him… I didn’t have any money or anything,” he said at the time. </p>



<p>“My dad kept that all.”</p>



<p>Billy Brown, of course, is not around to defend himself these days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"></figure>



<p>Elsewhere, Matt claimed that Alaskan Bush People was essentially faked for the camera; and also said that producers hooked him up with cocaine.</p>



<p>“It’s heartbreaking that he would say such horrible lies about Da just a few months after he passed away,” Bear said this week, adding:</p>



<p>“I pray that he can find the peace and serenity in his life that he needs.”</p>



<p><strong>Season 14 of Alaskan Bush People is currently airing Sunday nights on Discovery Channel.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>After years of red flags, court orders, and alarming social media posts, <a href="/2022/03/bear-brown-alaskan-bush-people-star-arrested-for-domestic-violen/">Bear Brown was arrested for domestic violence</a> in March.</p>
<p>As he has in the past, the <em>Alaskan Bush People</em> star insisted that the charges are &quot;unfounded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The facts will reveal the truth,&quot; he insisted last month. And perhaps they have.</p>
<p>Bear has now accepted a plea deal, waiting his right to a trial.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/5221852/alaskan-bush-people-bear-brown-settlement-domestic-violence-arrest/"><em>The Sun</em></a> reported on Thursday, April 28 that Bear Brown has accepted a plea deal.</p>
<p>That does not mean that the court has ratified this arrangement.</p>
<p>At a hearing scheduled for May 12 &#8212; about two weeks from now &#8212; a judge will have to approve the deal.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In most cases, entering a plea deal involves negotating with (or simply accepting an offer from) prosecutors.</p>
<p>This could mean accepting a sentence in advance, though it is unknown what Bear may have agreed to do.</p>
<p>Judges sometimes weigh in during these hearing, but traditionally deals are supposed to be approved as-is.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This latest development comes a month and a half after Bear&#8217;s first attempt at entering a plea.</p>
<p>On March 14, he pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>At that time, he requested a jury trial &#8212; something likely to be painful and embarrassing for him and for his wife, Raiven.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Clearly, several things have changed beyond simply Bear&#8217;s plea.</p>
<p>Just after Bear&#8217;s initial plea hearing, Raiven dropped the protective order that the court had issued against him.</p>
<p>The order was placed on March 14 &#8230; and, just two days later, Raiven requested that the order be rescinded.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bear had been arrested just three days before the hearing, on March 11.</p>
<p>Apparently, he and his wife had gotten into an argument while cleaning up their camp trailer while preparing to move.</p>
<p>Moving is one of the most stressful life events that most people experience &#8212; but nothing could excuse what happened next.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bear allegedly became violent with Raiven, thus the domestic violence arrest and charge.</p>
<p>This is sadly not surprising for those who have followed Bear and Raiven&#8217;s story for years.</p>
<p>They have had multiple messy breakups, and this is not the first time that Raiven has feared for her safety &#8212; or taken out a protecive order.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>However, on social media, after the news broke, Raiven called it &quot;a private matter.&quot;</p>
<p>For the record, domestic violence is a crime that is very much the public&#8217;s business, no matter where it occurs.</p>
<p>Raiven also discouraged people from &quot;being a bully&quot; towards her husband after his arrest, insisting that the delicate subject &quot;shouldn&#8217;t be shared online.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Raiven asked for &quot;the respect and privacy to handle our personal issues as a family alone.&quot;</p>
<p>She admonished fans and followers: &quot;Don&#8217;t believe everything you read online.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s generally good advice &#8230; but in this context, sounds like she went from alleged victim to not-so-alleged advocate for Bear within just a few days.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;The most important person in this situation is our son,&quot; Raiven correctly noted.</p>
<p>&quot;All I am certain of is we both just want the same freedoms you all have,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The right to sort out our personal matters,&quot; Raiven concluded. &quot;Also not to be judged on things other people don&rsquo;t have all the facts for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to various outlets, the Alaskan Bush People star was arrested on the evening of March 11 on a charge of domestic violence in the fourth degree.</p>
<p>He was taken to Okanogan County Jail at the time and then released on Monday without bail.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Bear, whose real name is Solomon Isaiah Freedom Brown, reportedly got into an altercation with his newlywed of a wife, Raiven Adams, as the couple was cleaning its trailer for a move.</p>
<p>Based on the police report, things grew physical after Raiven told Brown to watch the couple&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>She says he then pushed her down and pinned her on a bed, with officers noting a scratch on Adams around the time they were called to the scene.</p>
<p>During the alleged confrontation, Raiven was on the phone with some of her family members &#8230;who told cops they could hear Raiven yell, &quot;Ow, you&#8217;re hurting me!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>These same relatives claimed they could hear Brown calling her a &quot;bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>As for Bear&#8217;s side of the story?</p>
<p>He admits to arguing with his spouse. And to making an attempt to grab the phone out of Raiven&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>But denies laying his hands on her.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><a href="/2022/01/bear-brown-and-raiven-adams-marry-despite-multiple-breakups-rest/">Brown and Raiven got married</a> in January of this year, but they exchanged vowed after a tumultuous last few years.</p>
<p>Just two weeks after getting engaged in August 2019, for example, they&nbsp;&quot;made the difficult decision to part ways as a couple,&quot; explained the pair at the time.</p>
<p>The day after their break-up, they announced Adams&#8217; pregnancy&#8230; and decided to give their relationship another chance.</p>
<p>Brown and Adams eventually separated again, however, before reconciling once more prior to their marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Heck, Bear didn&#8217;t even hold his son for the first time until the toddler was six months old.</p>
<p>One year ago, Raiven also filed a restraining order against Bear, accusing him back then of exhibiting &ldquo;erratic&rdquo; and &ldquo;abusive&rdquo; behavior.</p>
<p>She claimed in one alleged incident that he began &quot;yelling and slamming things,&rdquo; and prevented her from &ldquo;leaving rooms.&quot;</p>
<p>The Alaskan Bush People star claimed he admitted his behavior was caused by &quot;cocaine.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>After her son was born in March 2020, Adams called out the Browns, claiming Alaskan Bush People is scripted and vowing to keep her child away from the camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of it is real. About 10 percent of it is real. My son is not going down with the show,&rdquo; Ravien said via her Instagram Stories in August 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This show is not real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Brown nor Adams has commented on the latter&#8217;s arrest.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Following their nuptials, though, Brown spoke highly of his bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels really good to be a married man, I&rsquo;ve loved Raiven [for] a long time and it&rsquo;s [an] honor and a privilege to finally call her my wife,&rdquo; he said at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the most beautiful woman I&rsquo;ve ever seen and still takes my breath away! I only wish Dad had been there, but I know he was watching from the best seat!</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to building a life, a family and a home with Raiven, she&rsquo;s the love of my life and my heart belongs to her and her alone.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Almost two years after <a href="/2020/03/raiven-adams-gives-birth-bear-brown-suddenly-denies-paternity/">becoming parents together</a>, Bear Brown and Raiven Adams have married.</p>
<p>The <em>Alaskan Bush People</em> star and his new bride have had major ups and downs during their troubled relationship.</p>
<p>Their latest reconciliation was in August of 2021.</p>
<p>Now, they are all smiles as they celebrate their nuptials with loved ones.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday, January 17, the official Alaskan Bush People Instagram page announced the big news.</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations to Bear and Raiven!&quot; the post read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The #AlaskanBushPeople couple and parents to 1-year-old River tied the knot yesterday,&quot; the caption detailed, &quot;in an intimate ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bear spoke to Discovery about the nuptials and this major relationship milestone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it feels really good to be a married man,&quot; he gushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &hellip; I&rsquo;ve loved Raiven a long time,&quot; Bear acknowledged, &quot;and it&rsquo;s a honor and a privilege to finally call her my wife.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;She is the most beautiful woman I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&quot; Bear raved.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; he said of his wife, Raiven &quot;still takes my breath away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raiven expressed that she was &ldquo;so very happy to have our friends and family that were able to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Bear looked very handsome,&quot; Raiven appraised.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; she continued, &quot;I&rsquo;m very grateful for the family we&rsquo;ve made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are parents to one-year-old River, who will actually turn two in early March.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bear&#8217;s mother, Ami Brown, was of course present for the ceremony.</p>
<p>So were his brothers Noah, Bam Bam, and Gabe.</p>
<p>His sisters, Rain and Bird, were also there for the wedding to cheer on their brother and their new sister-in-law.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There were a couple of very conspicuous absences, judging from what we know of the nuptials.</p>
<p>Family patriarch Billy Brown passed away nearly one year ago.</p>
<p>Ami is a widow, and he is dearly missed by the family.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There was also no sign of Matt Brown, though he is still living.</p>
<p>Matt has been estranged from at least parts of his family for some time, due to major conflicts with his parents.</p>
<p>He has struggled with addiction, and &#8212; not unfairly &#8212; takes issue with some of what it has been like being a reality TV familly.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish Da had of been there,&quot; Bear reflected with a hint of mourning.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; he continued, &quot;I know he was watching from the best seat.&quot;</p>
<p>Bear is of course referring to his belief that his father observed the nuptials from beyond the grave.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to building a life, a family, and a home with Raiven,&quot; Bear declared.</p>
<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s the love of my life,&quot; he affirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;And my heart belongs to her,&quot; Bear concluded, &quot;and her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bear and Raiven began dating a few years ago and were in a relationship for months before going public.</p>
<p>However, upon going public, things worsened in their relationship &#8212; especially when Bear&#8217;s thirsty fans got involved.</p>
<p>They were convinced that no one was good enough for Bear, and that took its toll &#8212; among other things &#8212; on their romance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Raiven and Bear split up, but Raiven almost immediately discovered that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>She and Bear went from dating to engaged to broken up to expectant parents in a relatively short time.</p>
<p>Eventually, their plans to co-parent together as friends turned into a reconciliation.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It was just the first breakup and reconciliation of many, however, and it continued after River was born.</p>
<p>Raiven at one point obtained a restraining order to protect her from Bear, describing alarming and menacing behavior.</p>
<p>Their breakups and reconciliations continued through last summer, reuniting in August three months after another split.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>That does not sound like a recipe for stability, particularly in light of Bear&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p>(While Raiven&#8217;s descriptions of him are allegations, Bear did make a fool of himself on social media in a very public, not-so-alleged way)</p>
<p>We suppose that we can close our eyes and wish that everything will be happy and perfect for them now that they&#8217;re married.</p>

<p>The following content may be difficult for some readers to take.</p>
<p>It relates closely to the passing of Billy Brown and the tragic circumstances that surrounded his death.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As previously reported, the&nbsp;Alaskan Bush People star and family patriarch <a href="/2021/02/billy-brown-dies-alaskan-bush-people-patriarch-was-68/">died this month at the age of 68</a>.</p>
<p>The awful news was confirmed by Bear Brown, one of Billy&#8217;s sons and vetreran co-star on the aforementioned Discovery Channel reality show.</p>
<p>&quot;We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved patriarch Billy Brown passed away last night after suffering from a seizure,&quot; Bear wrote on his private Instagram account alongside a photo of his parents, Billy and Ami Brown.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Bear continued:</p>
<p>&quot;He was our best friend &#8212; a wonderful and loving dad, granddad and husband and he will be dearly missed.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, in a series of 911 calls <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/2352273/alaskan-bush-people-billy-brown-death-family-screamed-wake-up/">obtained by The Sun</a>, we have learned how Alaskan Bush People crew members desperately contacted authorities in an attempt to save Brown.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tragic to listen to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, I have someone not breathing. I need an ambulance like, as soon as possible,&quot; says one female employee to a 911 operator on a recording, adding at the time:</p>
<p>&quot;I work for them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Billy Brown is from the Alaskan Bush People, the show, we&rsquo;re part of the production team. His son just called me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bear Brown.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to this unnamed woman, Bear called <em>her</em> because he couldn&#8217;t get through to the police.</p>
<p>She was therefore calling 911 on behalf of the family members&#8230; who were with Billy when he collapsed and then rightfully went into a panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could hear them in the background telling him, &lsquo;Wake up!&rsquo; Wake up!&rsquo;&rdquo; the crew member told the 911 operator of the call she had just completed with Bear.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In another call, meanwhile, a male crew member dials 911 to&nbsp; allso report on Billy&rsquo;s seizure.</p>
<p>How did this second person learn of the fatal event that would claim Brown&#8217;s life?</p>
<p>From an &quot;audio message&quot; he received from Bear &quot;through Facebook.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="981" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-981x1024.png" alt="Billy Brown Photograph" class="wp-image-401772" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-981x1024.png 981w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-288x300.png 288w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-768x801.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-735x767.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-321x335.png 321w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-333x347.png 333w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-498x520.png 498w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-613x640.png 613w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-736x768.png 736w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph-920x960.png 920w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/02/billy-brown-photograph.png 992w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Discovery)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The exact order of events here are challenging to follow and a little confusing, but the sad bottom line remains the same:</p>
<p>A deputy from the Washington Sheriff&rsquo;s Office eventually arrived at Billy&#8217;s home for an emergency medical call.</p>
<p>He wrote in his report that t results in an &ldquo;unattended death.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="867" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-1024x867.png" alt="Billy Brown on Alaskan Bush People" class="wp-image-272155" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-1024x867.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-300x254.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-768x651.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-735x623.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-335x284.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-347x294.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-520x441.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-640x542.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-960x813.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people-1080x915.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/billy-brown-on-alaskan-bush-people.png 1446w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Discovery)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Wrote this officer in his official filing regarding the day&#8217;s events:</p>
<p>&quot;I was advised a 68-year-old male was reported to have been in seizure, the male had become unresponsive and had stopped breathing.</p>
<p>&quot;CPR had been done on the male without success.&quot;</p>
<p>The officer added that &ldquo;multiple people&rdquo; were inside the Washington residence, including family and crew members.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The deputy then said he interviewed Billy&#8217;s wife Ami and their son, Gabe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke briefly with Amora Brown, wife of the deceased male, Billy Brown,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;I offered condolences for her family&#8217;s loss, then was able to get her and Billy&#8217;s information, as well as some basic medical background on Billy.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="470" height="436" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/billy-brown-on-season-8.jpg" alt="Billy Brown on Season 8" class="wp-image-306413" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/billy-brown-on-season-8.jpg 470w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/billy-brown-on-season-8-300x278.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/billy-brown-on-season-8-335x311.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/billy-brown-on-season-8-347x322.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><figcaption>(Discovery)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I spoke to Gabriel, one of Billy&#8217;s sons and was able to get Billy&#8217;s medications to document, I also confirmed the health issues Billy had prior to his passing.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy had been in and out of the hospital for years, yet his death still came <a href="/2021/02/billy-brown-dead-at-68-alaskan-bush-people-mourn-family-patriarc/">as a shock to his loved ones</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are devastated to hear of Billy Brown&rsquo;s sudden passing,&quot; said TLC in a statement.</p>

<p>&quot;We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved patriarch Billy Brown passed away last night after suffering from a seizure,&quot; Bear wrote on his private Instagram account alongside a photo of his parents, Billy and Ami Brown.</p>
<p>&quot;He was our best friend &#8212; a wonderful and loving dad, granddad and husband and he will be dearly missed.&quot;</p>
<p>Concluded Bear:</p>
<p>&quot;He lived his life on his terms, off the grid and off the land and taught us to live like that as well.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to honor his legacy going forward, and to continue with his dream. We ask for privacy and prayers during this painful time. God Bless Everyone!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Ami and Billy have been married since 1979.</p>
<p>Prior to his passing, Billy had dedicated himself to the recovery of his wife, who is in remission &#8212; but who was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2017.</p>
<p>In the wake of this stunning and terrible development, various members of the famous Brown family have expressed their remorse on social media.</p>
<p>For example&#8230;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><strong>Rain Brown</strong> said she is grieving the loss of &ldquo;true friend,&quot; adding of her dad:</p>
<p>&quot;Not forever, but only in this world. Please hold my family in your thoughts and prayers, especially my mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Please hold your family tight for me. Words cannot express how wonderful he was and is. But I will say, the closest thing to an angel I&rsquo;ve ever known.</p>
<p>&quot;God bless you da I love and miss you dearly. You will always be my hero. God bless everyone.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><strong>Noah Brown</strong> shared the same message as Bear &#8230; alongside a photo of Billy spending time with his son, Elijah, which we&#8217;ve published below.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the <strong>Discovery Channel</strong>, meanwhile, released this statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are devastated to hear of Billy Brown&rsquo;s sudden passing.</p>
<p>&quot;He has been part of the @discovery family for years &mdash; a trailblazer, a lovely man, and most definitely one of a kind.</p>
<p>&quot;Our heart is with his family and those that knew him and loved him as they deal with this devastating loss.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>After Ami&#8217;s cancer diagnosis, the family permanently relocated from their homestead in rural Alaska to Washington, purchasing a 435-acre property in the North Cascade Mountains&#8230; so that Ami could continue to receive treatment.</p>
<p>This was the basis for the most recent season of Alaskan Bush People.</p>
<p>Billy had anchored the Discovery reality series since 2014.</p>
<p>He and Ami were parents to five sons and two daughters overall: Bear, Matthew, Gabriel, Joshua, Noah, Rain and Snowbird.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It remains stunning, to viewers of this program and followers of this family, that Billy died before Ami.</p>
<p>After months of painful radiation and chemotherapy, the latter was told she was cancer-free in late 2018.</p>
<p>&quot;I was expecting great news,&quot; the mother of seven previously told People Magazine. &quot;I could just feel it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The doctors were as shocked as we were,&quot; Billy added at the time.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>

<p>The 68-year-old father, grandfather, and reality television star had, after all, lived an eventful but at times hard life.</p>
<p>That takes its toll.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday, February 8, his children shared the heartbreaking news that they (and fans) had been dreading with the world.</p>
<p>Billy Brown has passed away.</p>
<p>His son Bear Brown was the first to share the grim, if not entirely surprising, news on his Instagram account.</p>

<p>&quot;We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved patriarch Billy Brown passed away last night,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Bear shared that his father passed away &quot;after suffering from a seizure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was our best friend,&quot; Bear affirmed of his father.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="887" height="785" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8.png" alt="Billy Brown in Season 8" class="wp-image-306197" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8.png 887w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-300x266.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-768x680.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-735x650.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-335x296.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-347x307.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-520x460.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/billy-brown-in-season-8-640x566.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Discovery Channel)</figcaption></figure>

<p>He went on to describe Billy as &quot;a wonderful and loving dad, granddad, and husband.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Bear announced, &quot;he will be dearly missed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He lived his life on his terms,&quot; Bear acknowledged of his late father.</p>
<p>He continued by writing that Billy lived both &quot;off the grid and off the land.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We do not at all mean to distract from this moving tribute, but Bear just made a very good almost-zeugma with that line.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Bear wrote in reflection, BIlly &quot;taught us to live like that as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to honor his legacy going forward,&quot; he affirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Bear wrote, &quot;to continue with his dream.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We ask for privacy and prayers during this painful time!&quot; Bear expressed to his followers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, he wrote: &quot;God bless everyone!!!&quot;</p>
<p>We can only imagine how painful and difficult that was for Bear to write out, just hours after his father passed away.</p>

<p>Rain Brown, the 18-year-old youngest daughter of Billy who was once the family&#8217;s de-facto spokesperson, took to Instagram an hour later with her own tribute.</p>
<p>&quot;I lost a true friend,&quot; Rain lamented of her father&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>&quot;Not forever,&quot; she added, &quot;but only in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please hold my family in your thoughts and prayers,&quot; Rain requested of her many fans and followers.</p>
<p>The youngster added that, along with her siblings, she asks for prayers for &quot;especially my mother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please,&quot; Rain implored her numerous followers, &quot;hold your family tight for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Words cannot express how wonderful he was and is,&quot; Rain praised her dearly departed father.</p>
<p>&quot;But I will say,&quot; she expressed, &quot;the closest thing to an angel I&rsquo;ve ever known.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God bless you da,&quot; Rain wrote.</p>

<p>Alaskan Bush People is a long-running, successful reality series that has endured more than its fare share of struggles before.</p>
<p>There was a time, just a few years ago, when fans and family alike suspected that Ami Brown might pass during her battle with lung cancer.</p>
<p>Ami survived, making an impressive recovery, and the family moved on &#8230; but some things changed.</p>

<p>The Brown family reaped the rewards of their years of reality television stardom, purchasing (yes) a Beverly Hills mansion just a short drive to the hospital where Ami needed medical treatment.</p>
<p>But that is not where they live throughout the year.</p>
<p>Even so, they did not return to Alaska.</p>

<p>Instead, the famous family put down roots in the lower 48 in rural Washington, purchasing hundreds of acres of property.</p>
<p>Some said this made their show (and persona) a bit of a misnomer, but they remain authentic through and through.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with the Brown family as they mourn a beloved husband, father, and grandfather.</p>
