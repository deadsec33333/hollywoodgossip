<p>Gabby Petito&#8217;s tragic story captivated the world.</p>



<p>What began as a suspicious disappearance soon confirmed everyone&#8217;s worst suspicions: a horrific murder. </p>



<p>Soon, a manhunt began for her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/gabby-petito-selfie-shows-bloody-face-injuries-did-police-ignore-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abusive fiance</a>, Brian Laundrie. When authorities found his body, they also recovered <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/brian-laundrie-confessed-to-murdering-gabby-petito-in-chilling-j/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a confession</a> to the heinous act.</p>



<p>But the world had unanswered questions. The new Netflix documentary, <em>American Murder: Gabby Petito</em>, managed to answer some of them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-american-murder-gabby-petito-delves-into-a-violent-tragedy">&#8216;American Murder: Gabby Petito&#8217; delves into a violent tragedy</h2>



<p>In August 2021, Brian Laundrie murdered Gabby Petito. The two had been documenting their &#8220;van life&#8221; on a prolonged trip. Gabby&#8217;s smiling photos with beautiful backdrops did not reveal the escalating violence that the man she loved was inflicting upon her.</p>



<p>Netflix&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81733793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Murder: Gabby Petito</a></em> delves beyond Gabby&#8217;s disappearance and the eventual discovery of her remains in Bridger-Teton National Forest the following month.</p>



<p>The next month, in October 2021, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/brian-laundrie-official-cause-of-death-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Laundrie died by suicide</a>. More or less everyone had suspected him immediately, and the discovery of her body and the ensuing autopsy had driven him into hiding.</p>

<p><em>American Murder: Gabby Petito</em> features members of Gabby&#8217;s family as well as several of her close friends. As such, there are details that the public never saw during the search for her &#8212; or the manhunt for her killer.</p>



<p>The documentary includes text messages that Gabby had sent, disturbing police body cam footage obtained through the FOIA, and even excerpts from Gabby&#8217;s personal journal.</p>



<p>We see all of this juxtaposed with snippets of Gabby&#8217;s #Vanlife Vlog. The vlog showed this picture-perfect depiction of a getaway. Gabby was an aspiring influencer who would never live to see her twenty-third birthday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gabby-petito-called-an-ex-boyfriend-on-the-day-of-her-murder">Gabby Petito called an ex-boyfriend on the day of her murder</h2>



<p>The docuseries sheds light upon how Gabby reached out to her ex. This came as a surprise even to filmmakers, according to filmmakers Julia Willoughby Nason and Mike Gasparro&#8217;s interview with <em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/streaming/features/gabby-petito-american-murder-netflix-called-ex-boyfriend-before-death-1236310695/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; Gasparro admitted. &#8220;We didn’t know she had reached out to him during a vulnerable time (during her trip with Brian). She was obviously suffering.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gasparro continued: &#8220;She trusted her ex and reached out. It was like a cry for help. We think that’s probably something that Brian caught wind of.&#8221;</p>

<p>As many victims of ongoing domestic violence know, trying to leave can be the most dangerous. Abusers can become even more violent when losing control of their victim. This (usually unspoken) threat is one of the factors that keeps so many from escaping.</p>



<p>The filmmakers are implying here that Gabby Petito&#8217;s reaching out to an ex for emotional support could have been discovered by her killer right before he murdered her.</p>



<p>That said, we do not know that. Brian Laundrie took some things to his grave &#8212; but only after making sure that Gabby took some to hers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-we-hear-her-voice-during-the-docuseries">Why do we hear her voice during the docuseries?</h2>



<p>Numerous Netflix viewers expressed concern after watching <em>American Murder: Gabby Petito</em>, wondering on social media whether the moments where Gabby&#8217;s &#8220;voice&#8221; appears on screen were some sort of ghoulish genAI recreation.</p>



<p>Some of those moments were. That is <em>unfortunate</em>, but was at least done with the permission of Gabby&#8217;s family.</p>



<p>There is a hope that the media circus that surrounded her disappearance and murder will help others to recognize signs of abuse: in their loved ones and in their own relationships.</p>

<p>Gabby Petito&#8217;s tragic death did not have to happen. Yes, Brian Laundrie murdered her through domestic violence. But he was not the only </p>



<p>The Petito family&#8217;s lawsuit against Moab police has already shown <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/gabby-petito-selfie-shows-bloody-face-injuries-did-police-ignore-this/">how obvious Gabby&#8217;s injuries were</a> in her final weeks of life.</p>



<p>These failures &#8212; and worse &#8212; did not stop after Gabby&#8217;s death. And it was not only the police who did not prioritize justice.</p>



<p>According to the Petito family legal team, Brian Laundrie&#8217;s mother wrote him a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; letter advising him on how to get away with her murder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>One of the attorneys representing Gabby Petito&#8217;s parents has accused Brian Laundrie&#8217;s mother of attempting to aid and abet her son after Gabby&#8217;s murder.</p>



<p>Specifically, advising him to get a shovel, bury a body, and burn the note itself.</p>



<p>This week, during a court hearing, attorney Patrick Reilly told the court about an alleged letter that investigators recovered from Laundrie&#8217;s backpack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Remember, Laundrie took his own life while in hiding. His belongings yielded a number of answers.</p>



<p>The letter, the attorney accused, discussed the idea of Roberta Laundrie eventually &#8220;helping him get out of prison&#8221; if he ended up behind bars.</p>



<p>Vaguely, he added that the letter alluded to &#8220;some other things.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>That was not all.</p>



<p>Additionally, the attorney told the court that the envelope that contained the letter had a message on it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Burn after reading,&#8221; the envelope allegedly read. Clearly, Laundrie did not comply with his mother&#8217;s alleged wishes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Laundrie has been confirmed dead, bringing an end to a saga that started with the disappearance and death of his girlfriend.</figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0">Since the story of Gabby Petito&#8217;s harrowing disappearance first circulated and became a viral, must-watch saga, all eyes were on the Laundries.</p>



<p>Most people very sensibly concluded that the most likely suspect was her boyfriend. They had been traveling together and living out of a van. </p>



<p>And a bystander had witnessed Laundrie physically abusing her just weeks before her murder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The late Gabby Petito photographed the injuries to her face weeks before her death. Many victims of abuse do this, particularly out of fear that next time will be worse. (Photo via Parker &#038; McConkie)</figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">The letter is real. Even the Laundrie family&#8217;s own attorney confirmed as much.</p>



<p>However, Team Laundrie is trying to argue that the letter is irrelevant &#8212; alleging that it &#8220;pre-dates Brian and Gabby&#8217;s trip.&#8221;</p>



<p>P. Matthew Luka elaborated, alleging that despite the phrasing &#8212; about burying a body and burning the letter &#8212; it&#8217;s all just an unfortunate coincidence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Authorities searched the Laundrie residence while investigating Gabby Petito&#8217;s disappearance and murder.</figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-10">&#8220;I know that some of the wording that was used in the letter is unfortunate and might suggest that it has some connection, but it doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; the attorney alleged.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Team Petito noted that the letter does not have a date.</p>



<p>One has to wonder how many letters Laundrie had with him when he went into hiding. Does one take old, accidentally incriminating letters when they&#8217;re on the lam?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Laundrie was on the run from the authorities. The former YouTuber was wanted in connection with the murder of Gabby Petito.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Late this summer, in August, this lawsuit is expected to get underway in earnest.</p>



<p>The Petito family is not suing the Laundries over Brian murdering her. Rather, they are suing for emotional distress during the investigation.</p>



<p>Simply put, you do not have a legal obligation to tell someone that their daughter is dead in most cases. But if you make a public statement implying that she may be alive, while you privately know that she is not &#8230; that&#8217;s different. A court will determine whether this cruel act is what transpired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/family-of-gabby-petito-files-wrongful-death-claim-against-moab-police/">Gabby Petito&#8217;s loved ones filed a wrongful death suit</a> against Moab police.</p>



<p>Her disappearance and tragic murder captivated much of the world in 2021. But, weeks earlier, police came face to face with Gabby and her killer.</p>



<p>That shameful moment is no secret. But it may have been worse than we realized.</p>



<p>Gabby&#8217;s face had visible injuries from her abuse that night. And there&#8217;s a selfie, taken around that time, to show it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>On August 12, 2021, a bystander called 911 to seek help for a young woman who was clearly being abused.</p>



<p>That young woman was Gabby Petito. The person who contacted emergency services witnessed a man hitting her.</p>



<p>That man was Brian Laundrie. Through escalating physical violence, he took her life before the end of the month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Infamously, police showed up &#8230; but utterly failed Gabby. In fact, officers filed the domestic violence incident as a &#8220;mental health crisis&#8221; rather than as abuse.</p>



<p>Even the city of Moab has agreed that the &#8220;unintentional mistakes&#8221; by police left Gabby vulnerable to further abuse. Ultimately, it was Brian&#8217;s abuse that led to her grisly murder at the hands of the man she loved.</p>



<p>Now, her family&#8217;s lawsuit against Moab police has shed light on how glaringly obvious Gabby&#8217;s injuries should have been to police.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The late Gabby Petito photographed the injuries to her face weeks before her death. Many victims of abuse do this, particularly out of fear that next time will be worse. (Photo via Parker &#038; McConkie)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gabby took this photo on her cell phone, in the back of her van, on August 12, 2021. She was in Moab at the time.</p>



<p>Attorney Brian C. Stewart <a href="https://people.com/crime/new-photo-shows-gabby-petito-documenting-face-injuries-before-encountering-moab-police/">spoke to <em>People</em></a><em> </em>about the photo and how it not only highlights the tragedy of her death, but how people could and should have prevented it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe she knew she was in trouble and that this crossed the line and she took that picture in the back of the van,&#8221; Stewart expressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gabby Petito family addresses media (28 September 2021)</figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8">&#8220;According to available data, the image was taken a 4:37 PM, at or before the approximate time of the initial 911 call,&#8221; attorneys detailed about the photo of her injuries.</p>



<p>In the image, we can see a visible cut under Gabby&#8217;s eye. There are also remnants of blood on her cheek and forehead.</p>



<p>Domestic abusers tend to escalate over time, whether their targets are children or partners or others. It seems that Gabby felt that this escalation was frightening enough to document.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gabby Petito posed in front of a colorful mural designed for influencers and others to pose in front of.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the lawsuit, Gabby showed her injuries to one of the officers.</p>



<p>The filing cites that &#8220;he ignored her and did nothing more to investigate or document the injury.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is her parents&#8217; belief that Gabby would be alive today if Moab police had acted properly in response to the 911 call and acted to protect the victim of an obvious domestic violence incident.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-10">&#8220;It is totally heartbreaking to see her hurt and scared and in need and to have her concerns ignored the way that it was,&#8221; Stewart commented to<em> People</em>. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-10">&#8220;We believe that if they followed up and investigated those injuries and asked the questions,&#8221; he noted.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-10">Stewart continued: &#8220;they should have they would have understood the danger she was in and <em>she </em>would have better understood the danger she was in. We believe she would be alive today if they handled it properly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in the summer of 2021 the disappearance of Gabby Petito captured the attention of a horrified nation.</p>



<p>One week after her mother reported her missing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/gabby-petito-confirmed-dead-autopsy-reveals-cause-of-vloggers-tr/">Petito&#8217;s remains were discovered</a> at a campground in Wyoming.</p>



<p>The lifestyle vlogger, who had been traveling the country with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, was just 22 years old.</p>



<p>A nationwide <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/brian-laundrie-spotted-in-florida-manhunt-continues-for-fiance-o/">manhunt for Laundrie</a> ensued, coming to an end when the suspect&#8217;s skeletal remains were found in Florida&#8217;s Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Brian Laundrie murdered Gabby Petito, then took his own life. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Medical examiners determined that Laundrie had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>



<p>Police later revealed that they discovered a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/brian-laundrie-confessed-to-murdering-gabby-petito-in-chilling-j/">written confession to Petito&#8217;s murder </a>among Laundrie&#8217;s belongings.</p>



<p>Needless to say, viral news stories don&#8217;t get much more tragic than the sad saga of Gabby Petito.</p>



<p>So why did this case become fodder for a strangely lighthearted Celebrity Jeopardy clue?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>In the summer of 2021, Gabby Petito was murdered by boyfriend Brian Laundrie. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, viewers were taken aback this week when the Mayim Bialik-hosted Sunday night series casually referenced the horrifying Petit-Laundrie case.</p>



<p>“In 2021, fugitive Brian Laundrie ended his days in Fla’s Myakkahatchee Creek area, home to these long &amp; toothy critters,&#8221; read the clue.</p>



<p>The answer was revealed as “What are alligators?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Jeopardy! Slammed For Insanely Distasteful Question" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2DqJRV_rks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>For obvious reasons, viewers were appalled by the clue, with many calling it the most offensive moment in the show&#8217;s history.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not celebrity @jeopardy using Brian Laundrie as a clue for alligators.. that’s so distasteful and wrong could’ve used anything else for a clue,&#8221; one person tweeted, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/14/jeopardy-slammed-for-insensitive-and-appalling-clue/">according to</a> Page Six.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the most tasteless and insensitive answer I&#8217;ve ever seen on any Jeopardy! What the hell were they thinking? Making light of that tragic situation is repugnant. Damn. #CelebrityJeopardy,&#8221; another added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“THIS, this is beyond offensive. It’s appalling &amp; completely insensitive, not to mention totally unnecessary. Shame on, @Jeopardy,”&nbsp;a third chimed in.</p>



<p>Others demanded answers and wanted to know how many people had to sign off on the decision to use such an oddly &#8220;edgy&#8221; clue on the long-running quiz show.</p>



<p>“What in the hell is wrong with you? Have you no soul? I can’t believe this question got past your lawyers,” one viewer tweeted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>“This is the most tasteless and insensitive answer I’ve ever seen on any Jeopardy!” another fumed, adding: </p>



<p>“What the hell were they thinking? Making light of that tragic situation is repugnant.”</p>



<p>Steve Bertolino, an attorney for the Laundrie family, revealed that his clients were similarly shocked.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Gabby Petito posted this photo of herself and Brian Laundrie in this photo before her death. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;The entire Laundrie family is appalled and concurs with all of the comments on social media on how distasteful this was. I believe an apology is due,&#8221; Bertolino said in a statement issued this week.</p>



<p>&#8220;For this distasteful Jeopardy question to be posed only highlights the sensationalism that surrounded this tragedy and puts salt on the wounds of a family that has not been afforded any rights or privacy when the family themselves did nothing wrong,&#8221; the attorney added.</p>



<p>Many pointed out that it&#8217;s not uncommon for the show to base clues on real-life criminal cases.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Brian Laundrie and Gabby Petito pose together here for an Instagram photo, snapped not long before the latter was killed. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But there&#8217;s a difference between quizzing players about the exploits of Al Capone and making a grim reference to the recent deaths of two young people.</p>



<p>The phrase &#8220;too soon&#8221; was coined for instances like this one, and it&#8217;s no surprise that Jeopardy fans are shocked.</p>



<p>Over the course of its decades on the air, the show has proven quite adept at avoiding this sort of controversy.</p>



<p>Hopefully, producers will take steps toward making amends sometime soon.</p>

<p>In the autumn of last year, the tragic murder of Gabby Petito was on everyone&#8217;s minds.</p>



<p>Brian Laundrie killed her, hid her body, tried to return to his normal life, became a fugitive, and died by suicide.</p>



<p>He even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/brian-laundrie-admits-to-killing-gabby-petito-in-just-released-notebook-entry/">confessed to Gabby&#8217;s murder</a> in writing. That is not the end of the story, however.</p>



<p>Gabby&#8217;s parents are suing the Laundrie family, and the judge isn&#8217;t letting them throw the case out of court.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Gabby Petito&#8217;s surviving loved ones are suing Brian Laundrie&#8217;s parents, Christopher and Roberta.</p>



<p>The lawsuit alleges that the Laundries knew where Gabby&#8217;s remains were located during the search for her.</p>



<p>Authorities were conducting a widespread search for her, only finding her body on September 19.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Joseph Petito and Nichole Schmidt are seeking more than $30,000 in damages.</p>



<p>They are suing over the mental anguish that they incurred during this time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just that their daughter was abused and murdered &#8212; they are accusing the Laundries of deceit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The lawsuit also accuses Christopher and Roberta of actively helping Brian to conceal Gabby&#8217;s murder</p>



<p>They believe that the family was also conspiring to help Brian flee the country.</p>



<p>Within the filing, Gabby&#8217;s parents accuse the Laundries of going on vacation with Brian after Gabby&#8217;s murder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>This is when Joseph and Nichole were actively looking for their missing daughter and needed help.</p>



<p>In fact, they pleaded for help &#8212; but Nichole wrote that Roberta blocked her phone and Facebook profile at that time.</p>



<p>The Laundrie family is fighting back, and filed to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Their argument is heartless, but simple: </p>



<p>They believe that they were not obligated to disclose anything that they may have known.</p>



<p>However, a Florida circuit court judge has denied the motion to dismiss.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Gabby Petito posed with Brian Laundrie in this photo. Evidence related to her disappearance, from eyewitness reports of domestic violence to Brian&#8217;s later disappearance, has made all photos of their &#8220;happy&#8221; times together disturbing in retrospect.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The civil lawsuit will proceed to trial.</p>



<p>Though the judge agreed that the Laundries were not required to speak about the case, there is more to it.</p>



<p>The judge noted that the lawsuit accuses the Laundries of &#8220;particularly callous and cruel&#8221; actions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;If the facts of this case were truly about silence with no affirmative action by the Laundries,&#8221; the court ruled.</p>



<p>The judge continued: &#8220;The court would have resolved this case in the Laundries favor.&#8221;</p>



<p>This would have been &#8220;&#8221;on the concept of the lack of legal duty for the Laundries to act.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Brian laundrie note.Credit: Courtesy of Steven Bertolino</figcaption></figure>



<p>But this is not a &#8220;Good Samaritan law&#8221; case.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had the Laundries truly stayed silent, the court would have granted the motion to dismiss in the Laundries favor,&#8221; the judge noted.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; the court acknowledged, &#8220;they did not stay silent.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Days into the search for Gabby, the Laundries released a statement.</p>



<p>The family claimed at that time to hope that the search was successful and that Gabby would return safely to her family.</p>



<p>If the Laundries knew at the time that Gabby had been dead for days, then that was cruel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The judge noted that such an act &#8220;is sufficiently outrageous to state claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.&#8221;</p>



<p>In simple terms, Brian&#8217;s parents could have said nothing whatsoever and likely avoided a lawsuit.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t tell somebody that you hope that their kid is okay.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Brian Laundrie and Gabby Petito pose together here for an Instagram photo, snapped not long before the latter was killed.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Not when you know that she&#8217;s dead. </p>



<p>Especially when your son killed her.</p>



<p>If Gabby&#8217;s parents can prove that the Laundries knew at that time, they might win the lawsuit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Last year, following the heartbreaking murdery of Gabby Petito and a lengthy manhunt, Brian Laundrie&#8217;s remains were found.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/11/brian-laundrie-official-cause-of-death-revealed/">Laundrie&#8217;s cause of death</a> was a gunshot wound to the head. After fleeing authorities as the most wanted fugitive in the country, he died by suicide.</p>
<p>For months, further details beyond Laundrie&#8217;s death and confession were kept under wraps until the medical examiner&#8217;s report was ready.</p>
<p>Now, the report reveals the grisly details of what experts found when examining Laundrie&#8217;s remains.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Long before the 23-year-old fugitive&#8217;s remains were found, it was expected that he was likely no longer alive.</p>
<p>There are many hazards to attempting to live in the wilderness, particularly in Florida.</p>
<p>Though Brian Laundrie took his own life, his full autopsy report confirms that those dangers found him even after death.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday, February 14, the full 47-page autopsy report was released by Florida&#8217;s District 12 Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office.</p>
<p>Laundrie&#8217;s remains were described as &quot;skeletal&quot; by examiners.</p>
<p>Bones belonging to Laundrie showed signs of &quot;moderately extensive carnivore activity evidenced by multiple gouging and gnawing marks.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Many had speculated that alligators would certainly access Laundrie, before or after his death.</p>
<p>However, the report shared that the predators that scavenged his corpse were more mammalian in nature.</p>
<p>The medical examiner&#8217;s office concluded that the markings were &quot;consistent&quot; with feral dogs, coyotes, rodents, or raccoons.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Multiple long bones including bones of the arms and legs all disclose carnivore predation activity,&quot; the report read.</p>
<p>This predation activity was &quot;characterized by gnawing and chewing.&quot;</p>
<p>Items found near the remains included green shorts, shoes, a backpack, a white metal ring, and a &quot;short-barrel revolver handgun with extensive rust.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The contents of the &quot;handwritten half note&quot; were not disclosed in the medical examiner&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>This, along with a red hat, were found at a secondary location, alongside some animal remains.</p>
<p>A green backpack contained an unpitched tent and flares were also found there.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A dry bag was found, containing &quot;a journal along with a wooden box that contained a small notebook and photographs.&quot;</p>
<p>Laundrie appeared in some of those photos.</p>
<p>This was only about 250 feet away from where Laundrie&#8217;s remains were found.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Last month, the FBI confirmed that Laundrie had left a written confession to the murder of Gabby Petito.</p>
<p>The admission was found in a notebook alongside his remains.</p>
<p>With that, the nation&#8217;s foremost law enforcement agency concluded that Petito&#8217;s tragic murder was officially solved.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Most considered it a foregone conclusion that Laundrie had murdered his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses described him yelling and even striking her in full view of the public.</p>
<p>Given that most abusers go to great lengths to hide their violent natures, it was only natural for people to wonder how much worse things were in private.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>A small but sinister backlash emerged during the early days of the manhunt for Laundrie, however.</p>
<p>Incels, &quot;men&#8217;s rights&quot; activists, and white nationalists (a venn diagram of those groups is mostly just one circle) rallied to defend Laundrie even after his disappearance.</p>
<p>In their eyes, the instant villification of Laundrie in the media showed how society &quot;treats men,&quot; treats white men, and also treats bald men.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Gabby Petito case also drew constructive criticism as yet another example of how a conventionally attractive white woman&#8217;s case receives more attention than others.</p>
<p>Dozens of women of color had gone missing in the past decade in the same area where Petito was murdered, but did not receive even 1% of the attention.</p>
<p>The Petito family acknowledged this and, even as they mourned Gabby, used their platform to shine attention upon other families who were just as desperate for answers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>For several tense days last summer, the world held its collective breath as investigators <a href="/2021/09/gabby-petito-confirmed-dead-autopsy-reveals-cause-of-vloggers-tr/">searched for Gabby Petito</a>, a missing 22-year-old woman who disappeared while traveling the country in a van with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Petito family&#8217;s worst fears were confirmed on September 19, 2021, when <a href="/2021/10/gabby-petito-cause-of-death-revealed-amid-manhunt-for-suspected/">Gabby&#8217;s body was found</a>&nbsp;in Bridger-Teton National Park in Wyoming.</p>
<p>The discovery gave way to several more weeks of frantic police work, as authorities attempted to locate Laundrie, who was suspected of Petito&#8217;s murder.</p>
<p>After <a href="/2021/10/brian-laundrie-confirmed-dead-after-months-long-manhunt/">Laundrie&#8217;s skeletal remains were discovered</a> in Florida the following month, his suicide was taken as a grim confirmation that he was indeed the killer.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But the 24-year-old&#8217;s death also looked as though it would deny closure to the Petito family, who would now be left wondering about the final hours of Gabby&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Now, however, the FBI has revealed to the public that &quot;written statements by Mr. Laundrie claiming responsibility for Ms. Petito&#8217;s death&quot; were discovered among his remains.</p>
<p>&quot;All logical investigative steps have been concluded in this case,&quot; FBI Denver Division Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider told the press.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;The investigation did not identify any other individuals other than Brian Laundrie directly involved in the tragic death of Gabby Petito.&quot;</p>
<p>Schneider concluded by thanking the public for their tips and assistance during the manhunt for Laundrie.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI&#8217;s primary focus throughout the investigation was to bring justice to Gabby and her family. The public&#8217;s role in helping us in this endeavor was invaluable as the investigation was covered in the media around the world,&quot; the investigator said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;On behalf of the FBI, I want to express my deepest appreciation to the public for the thousands of tips that were provided during the investigation, and to our local, state and federal law enforcement partners for their work throughout the investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Schneider indicated that this will be the FBI&#8217;s final public update on the Petito-Laundrie case, which has been making global headlines ever since Petito was reported missing in September of last year.</p>
<p>While investigators received reports of Laundrie sightings all over the US, they focused their search on the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park near his family&#8217;s home in&nbsp;North Port, Florida.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After receiving assistance from Laundrie&#8217;s parents, investigators discovered his remains in October.</p>
<p>One month later, on November 23, a medical examiner in Sarasota, Florida confirmed that Laundrie had passed away of a self-infliced gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are still unanswered questions surrounding the deaths of these two young people, whose videos documenting their travels had earned them a sizable following on YouTube.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While past domestic violence incidents indicate that their relationship was a volatile one, we&#8217;ll likely never know exactly what transpired on that fateful day in Wyoming, when choked the life from a cheerful young woman who was beloved by all who knew her.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Gabby&#8217;s loved ones can find some solace in the closing of this months-long investigation into their&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s tragic death.</p>
<p>But while many of their questions have now been answered, the pain of losing Gabby at such a young age and in such a horrific fashion will no doubt linger for many years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>We have an update on the tragic case of Gabby Petito, the young blogger who was found dead this summer after having gone missing for weeks; and Brian Laundrie, the 22-year old&#8217;s boyfriend who many believed murdered Petitio.</p>
<p>According to attorney&nbsp;Steven Bertolino,&nbsp;aundrie died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p>His death has been ruled a suicide.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide,&quot; said Bertolino in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Chris and Roberta are still mourning the loss of their son and are hopeful that these findings bring closure to both families.&quot;</p>
<p>The news comes about five weeks after <a href="/2021/10/brian-laundrie-confirmed-dead-after-months-long-manhunt/">partial human remains of the 23-year-old fugitive</a> were discovered in Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park &#8230; near Laundrie&#8217;s last known location.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Laundrie had been named a person of interest in the disappearance of his fianc&eacute;e on September 15, although the police never came out and listed Laundrie as a suspect.</p>
<p>After Brian was confirmed dead, Bertolino also spoke out on behalf of the family, telling the public:</p>
<p>&quot;Chris and Roberta Laundrie have been informed that the remains found yesterday in the reserve are indeed Brian&#8217;s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have no further comment at this time and we ask that you respect the Laundrie&#8217;s privacy at this time.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Petito and Laundrie had spent several weeks traveling across the country in a white van together, documenting their adventures on YouTube along the way.</p>
<p>However, on September 1, Laundrie returned to his parents&#8217; Florida home &#8212; without Petito.</p>
<p>Ten days later, the 22-year-old woman&#8217;s family reported her missing.</p>
<p>For the first week of Petito&#8217;s missing persons investigation, Laundrie&#8217;s mother and father refused to cooperate with authorities, directing all questions to their lawyer.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A short while later, though, the family opened up to the FBI about how Brian had also gone missing.</p>
<p>Then, on September 19, Petito&#8217;s corpse was discovered in Grand Teton National Park.</p>
<p>Her death was ruled a homicide by the county coroner, who <a href="/2021/10/gabby-petito-cause-of-death-revealed-amid-manhunt-for-suspected/">said she died from strangulation</a>.</p>
<p>Days after that, even as his whereabouts remained unknown, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a warrant for Laundrie&#8217;s arrest in relation to activities that occurred after Petito&#8217;s death.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re just hoping that through our tragedy losing Gabby, that in the future, some good can come out of it, that we can help other people who may be in a similar situation,&quot; Gabby&#8217;s stepfather, Jim Schmidt, told reporters during a press conference at her memorial service on September 26.</p>
<p>&quot;We need positive stuff to come through this tragedy that happened.</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#8217;t let her name be taken in vain.</p>
<p>&quot;We need positive stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>According to a sheriff in Florida, Laundrie likely died by his own hand.</p>
<p>Which is to say: it&#8217;s believed that he committed suicide.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While the preliminary results of Laundrie&#8217;s autopsy have been inconclusive, North Port, Florida Police Chief Todd Garrison spoke out about the case at a community gathering this past Friday night.</p>
<p>Garrison was serving as a panelist at a law enforcement forum at the South County Tiger Bay Club on that date when he was asked by the moderator to discuss the case.</p>
<p>The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports that Garrison admitted to the mistakes in his agency&#8217;s investigation &#8230; most notably the fact that during surveillance they once mistook Laundrie&#8217;s mother, Roberta, for her son.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we made a mistake,&quot; he said &quot;It was human error, but I still stand behind my team.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sarasota County Sheriff Kurt Hoffman then jumped in to defend the department, stating at one point:</p>
<p>&quot;That guy went out there and by all accounts probably committed suicide and he was right out there where we thought he was,&quot; Sheriff Hoffman added.</p>
<p>&quot;There was four feet of water out there at the time.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>As a quick refresher:</p>
<p>Laundrie was the subject of a nationwide search after the <a href="/2021/10/gabby-petito-cause-of-death-revealed-amid-manhunt-for-suspected/">death of Gabby Petito</a>, a 22-year old vlogger whose body was found in Wyoming in September.</p>
<p>She and Laundrie had been dating at the time of her disappearance, which took place toward the end of a months-long trip they were on around the country.</p>
<p>Authorities have said Petito died by strangulation, labeling her death a homicide.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Laundrie was eventually named a person of interest in Petito&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>In the weeks since Petito vanished, the public learned that police were called at one point this August on Laundrie after an onlooker alleged he had struck his girlfriend in the face.</p>
<p>Brian was allegedly last seen on September 13, when he left his parents&#8217; North Port home, claiming he was going on a hike in the park in which his body was later found.</p>
<p>During the event late last week, chief Garrison stood up for his team and for the hard work they did over the past couple months.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I can tell you one thing,&quot; Garrison said, according to the Herald-Tribune.</p>
<p>&quot;The amount of work that was done, behind the scenes, 24 hours a day, from our team and the FBI team working on the second floor of the police department, was phenomenal work.&quot;</p>
<p>Just a tragic case overall.</p>
<p>May Gabby Petito rest in peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>After more than a month of widespread searching, wanted fugitive <a href="/2021/10/brian-laundrie-confirmed-dead-after-months-long-manhunt/">Brian Laundrie was confirmed dead</a> last week.</p>
<p>It was a frustrating conclusion to the manhunt, creating new questions while answering very few.</p>
<p>One of the first experts to review Brian&#8217;s remains was the medical examiner.</p>
<p>With the autopsy results inconclusive, it will take a particular kind of specialist to piece together how Brian met his end.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Sunday, Steven Bertolino spoke to <a href="https://people.com/crime/brian-laundrie-no-funeral-cremation-autopsy-inconclusive-family-attorney/"><em>People</em></a> about how both investigators and the Laundrie family are processing Brian&#8217;s passing.</p>
<p>First, the autopsy came back inconclusive.</p>
<p>While these are likely preliminary results, it does mean that there is no obvious cause of death &#8212; as there was for Gabby Petito&#8217;s murder.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;No manner or cause of death was determined,&quot; the attorney hired by the Laundries reported.</p>
<p>&quot;And the remains,&quot; he added, &quot;were sent to an anthropologist for further evaluation.&quot;</p>
<p>A forensic anthropologist is a specialist in remains too old or otherwise degraded for a conventional autopsy to bear fruit.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Eventually, investigators will be done with Brian&#8217;s remains and will likely turn them over to the Laundrie family.</p>
<p>Bertolino shared that the &quot;remains will be cremated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; the attorney added, &quot;there will be no funeral service.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The lack of a funeral service may be, in part, a practical concern &#8212; out of fear of controversy, protesters, and photographers.</p>
<p>It is also possible that there will be a private memorial in some form that is not made public.</p>
<p>After all, Bertolino is speaking as the family&#8217;s representative, not as an officer of the court, here. He doesn&#8217;t have to disclose anything.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>But the lack of a conclusive cause of death, the circumstances of the remains being found, and the lack of funeral point to one thing.</p>
<p>It sounds like Brian&#8217;s remains were in very poor shape.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be identified by dental records, generally, if your face or hands are still there.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Between the controversy and the state of the body, a funeral would be awkward.</p>
<p>Closed casket funerals exist, but someone as infamous as Brian would attract attention even in death.</p>
<p>A cemetary plot is expensive, and could become the worst kind of tourist attraction.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Cremation is a logical conclusion when it comes to partial human remains of an infamous amn.</p>
<p>Technically, the 23-year-old fugitive was only wanted for using Gabby Petito&#8217;s bank card after her murder.</p>
<p>However, it was expencted that he would face numerous other, more serious charges upon his capture.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Before Brian&#8217;s remains were discovered in Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, he had not been seen in over a month.</p>
<p>He was reported missing by his family on September 15, less than a week before Gabby&#8217;s own remains were found.</p>
<p>Unlike Brian&#8217;s examination, the autopsy of Gabby Petito quickly determined that she died by homicide, and concluded that the manner of death was strangulation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Late last week, Bertolino shared that Brian Laundrie was visibly distressed when his family last saw him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Brian was upset when he left,&quot; the attorney illustrated.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Bertolini shared, &quot;he was not able to be persuaded not to leave the house.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>There are many who suspect that Brian may have taken his own life, either immediately or shortly after going into hiding.</p>
<p>Others wonder if he died of natural causes, as Brian would have faced numerous hazards &#8212; from disease to hunger to alligators.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists have also suggested that he was given assitance but that someone helping him later murdered him. Hopefully, the anthropologist can provide answers.</p>
