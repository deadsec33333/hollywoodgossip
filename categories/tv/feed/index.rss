<p>The White Lotus Season 3 came, saw, felt very slow at times, revealed some shocking deaths&#8230; and then shattered some records.</p>



<p>On Sunday night, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-who-lives-who-dies-what-becomes-of-the-wildly-effed-up-ratliff-clan/">third season finale</a> drew 6.2 million viewers, a 30% jump over the previous series high… which was set at 4.8 million viewers just seven days earlier.</p>



<p>Along with the increase from Episode 7, this finale’s audience represented a 51% increase from the Season 2 finale and a 158% increase from the Season 3 premiere.</p>



<p>The show is a legitimate hit.</p>

<p>In case you weren&#8217;t aware, HBO has already given the green light to Season 4, an announcement that immediately prompted speculation from fans across the globe. </p>



<p>The White Lotus has already taken us to Hawaii. And Italy. And most recently Thailand.</p>



<p>Where might we be headed next?</p>



<p>Those who know creator Mike White well have said there&#8217;s no chance he takes the series anywhere cold; he just doesn&#8217;t like that type of environment.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/60c61ef9-b5ce-4ea2-a1d9-0d081c8466b7_1743210059.avif" alt="" class="wp-image-522944" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/60c61ef9-b5ce-4ea2-a1d9-0d081c8466b7_1743210059.avif 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/60c61ef9-b5ce-4ea2-a1d9-0d081c8466b7_1743210059-300x200.avif 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/60c61ef9-b5ce-4ea2-a1d9-0d081c8466b7_1743210059-768x512.avif 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/60c61ef9-b5ce-4ea2-a1d9-0d081c8466b7_1743210059-960x640.avif 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">RIP Chelsea, our favorite character on The White Lotus Season 3.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“For the fourth season, I want to get a little bit out of the crashing waves of rocks vernacular but there’s always more room for more murders at the White Lotus hotels,” <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-mike-white-teases-location-season-4-1236361757/">White said at the end </a>of Season 3 in an interview with Deadline.</p>



<p>This same outlet reported earlier this year that the HBO drama was considering a Four Seasons hotel in Europe for its impending season. </p>



<p>A source added that back then, however, that “everything is on the table for next season” and that no decision has been made.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, HBO Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi has also teased where Season 4 may take place in a chat with Deadline in February.</p>



<p>“We’re going on some locations scouting in the next couple of weeks, so we’ll know soon,” Orsi said. “I can’t really say where we’re going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”</p>

<p>According to Deadline insiders, any scouting trip for the next location has been pushed to summer because White needs a little break after Season 3.</p>



<p>The guy writes every episode. He has certainly earned it.</p>



<p>For those wondering, The Four Seasons chain and HBO formalized their partnership before Season 3 aired, meaning it’s increasingly likely Season 4 will <em>also</em> use a branch of the resort.</p>



<p>The luxury resort’s European locations include London, Paris, Geneva, Budapest, Athens, Madrid and Portugal. Just something to think about it and wonder about.</p>



<p>Early on in Season 3, Executive Producer David Bernad old The New York Post about future episodes: “We haven’t gotten to it yet,&#8221; adding:</p>



<p>“There’s a macro approach, which is ‘what’s a country that has a film community or local crew that also has a tax rebate that’s film friendly?’ We start in a broader sense, and each season has a larger theme.”</p>

<p>Ellen Pompeo is scrubbing out of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>In a way she never has before.</p>



<p>The actress is currently starting in Good American Family, a brand new drama on Hulu whose first two episodes were made available on March 19.</p>



<p>The role marks Pompeo&#8217;s first lead since she sky-rocketed to fame back in 2005 as Meredith Grey, the title character of the longest-running medical drama in TV history.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521678" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204996219-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ellen Pompeo attends the Special Premiere of Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;Good American Family&#8221; at Directors Guild Of America on March 13, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/ellen-pompeo-reveals-the-real-reason-why-shes-leaving-greys-anatomy/">Pompeo pared down her screen time</a> significantly on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8230; although she still serves as a producer and still makes the occasional cameo.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. I just knew that I really couldn&#8217;t do Grey&#8217;s anymore,&#8221; Pompeo explained this week on the Call Her Daddy podcast of that decision. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was to the point where I really just felt like an animal at the zoo. I&#8217;m a big believer in destiny. I thought, if there&#8217;s something else I&#8217;m meant to do, it&#8217;s gonna find me. But I know I have to leave this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pompeo, who earned $20 million per episode in her last ABC contract, had hinted in the past that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/ellen-pompeo-im-getting-ready-to-quit-acting/">she was done with acting</a>.</p>



<p>But here she is again.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="921" height="624" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo as Meredith" class="wp-image-454474" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg 921w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-768x520.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-735x498.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-335x227.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-347x235.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-520x352.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-640x434.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meredith seeks advice from Amelia in this Grey&#8217;s Anatomy scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes you know you&#8217;d like opportunities to come while you&#8217;re doing something, so you have an easy exit,&#8221; the actress said on this podcast. &#8220;You have a soft landing &#8211; and it turns out I actually <em>did</em> get a soft landing. But I was sort of thinking like nothing&#8217;s coming along, and I really believe in this town, if they want you, they will find you.&#8221;</p>



<p>When a new offer didn&#8217;t immediately present itself, Pompeo began to have some doubts. As anyone would. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on TV for 20 years, the biggest show ever, like everybody knows who I am. &#8220;Clearly, these people don&#8217;t want me,&#8221; she said of her feelings at the time. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not coming for me. No one&#8217;s offering me this [and] no one&#8217;s offering me that. I mean I&#8217;ve been offered a few things, obviously, but like could never make it work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good American Family stars Ellen Pompeo, Mark Duplass, Imogen Faith Reid, Dulé Hill, Christina Hendricks, Sarayu Blue and Jenny O&#8217;Hara.</p>



<p>It is based on a true story and here is the official synopsis:</p>



<p><em>Told from multiple points of view, as a means to explore issues of perspective, bias, and trauma, this compelling drama is inspired by the disturbing stories surrounding a Midwestern couple who adopts a girl with a rare form of dwarfism.</em></p>



<p><em>But as they begin to raise her alongside their three biological children, mystery emerges around her age and background, and they slowly start to suspect she may not be who she says she is. </em></p>



<p><em>As they defend their family from the daughter they&#8217;ve grown to believe is a threat, she fights her own battle to confront her past and what her future holds, in a showdown that ultimately plays out in the tabloids and the courtroom.</em></p>

<p>In the past, it was challenging for the star to step away from a program that shot for 10 months a year.</p>



<p>According to Pompeo, though, times have changed and &#8220;it&#8217;s become a little easier&#8221; to take on other roles since networks have reduced their orders to 15 episodes. </p>



<p>&#8220;But anyway, I had really stepped away, and I had said I really have to step away I can&#8217;t do it anymore,&#8221; she added on the podcast. </p>



<p>&#8220;And if nothing else comes, nothing else comes. It&#8217;s my destiny. [If] no one wants me, that&#8217;s okay, I can swallow that pill like I swallow everything else and at least I&#8217;m financially okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s official, television fans:</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll soon have a reason to believe once again.</p>



<p>On March 14, Apple TV+ confirmed that Ted Lasso will return for a fourth season&#8230; with Jason Sudeikis &#8212; who co-created the show with Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly and Bill Lawrence &#8212; set to reprise his role as the beloved and inspiring title character.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-1024x577.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-521382" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-1024x577.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-768x433.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-960x541.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023-1200x676.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Ted_Lasso_Photo_030904-H-2023.webp 1296w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">We&#8217;re all inspired by the words of Ted Lasso.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Apple TV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fanbase all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion and unwavering belief,” Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+, said in a statement on Friday.</p>



<p>“Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.”</p>



<p>A day earlier, Sudeikas hinted at this return during an appearance on the Jason Kelce and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/travis-kelce">Travis Kelce</a> podcast, New Heights.</p>



<p>He told the famous hosts that Ted will be coaching a women’s team and added: “It’s daunting, because we told the story we wanted to tell. But there’s more there.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-1024x683.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-521383" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0x0.webp 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Simply put, these are two of our favorite characters on TV.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Apple TV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following up after confirmation of Season 4 went viral, the actor said in a message of his own:</p>



<p>“We all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap. In Season 4, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to leap before they look, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.”</p>



<p>Chatter over a possible fourth season has been rampant since the show signed off in May 2023.</p>



<p>In February, Lawrence told The Hollywood Reporter:</p>



<p>“You will find that anybody involved with Ted Lasso will say the same thing: Our fearless leader Jason Sudeikis will talk about that when he’s ready. I’m sure he’s somewhere right now at SNL[‘s 50th anniversary show] answering the same question.”</p>

<p>Last August, Warner Bros. Television reportedly secured options for three original cast members: Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton; Brett Goldstein, who portrays coach Roy Kent; and Jeremy Swift, who stars as Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins.</p>



<p>We cannot state for certain at this time that these stars/characters will be back at Season 4.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a very safe assumption.</p>



<p>Ted Lasso Season 3 wrapped up with Ted deciding to return to the United States in order to be closer to his son and ex-wife, hinting at a reconciliation between former spouses&#8230; while other members of the Richmond team were moving into new phases of their lives. </p>



<p>Season 3 remains Apple TV+’s most watched show to date and finished 2023 as the number-one original streaming series in the United States, according to Nielsen.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, Meghan Markle is starring in a new Netflix series titled &#8220;With Love, Meghan.&#8221;</p>



<p>And in case you also haven&#8217;t heard, the show is not exactly getting met with enthusiastic rounds of applause and/or praise.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-uses-daughter-lilibet-to-promote-netflix-show-cant-do-anything-right/">Markle was accused of exploiting</a> her daughter to market the series.</p>



<p>Then, she garnered some backlash when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-corrects-mindy-kaling-on-how-to-address-her-during-awkward-with-love-meghan-segment/">she corrected Mindy Kaling</a> on her last name, claiming she should know by referred to as Meghan Sussex.</p>

<p>For the most part, viewers have come down hard on Markle for being inauthentic and self-absorbed.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s almost nothing when compared to what Stuart Heritage of The Guardian wrote a few days ago after checking out the program for the first time.</p>



<p>Referring to the overall production deal Markle and husband Prince Harry signed with Netflix, this critic writes:</p>



<p><strong><em>With Love, Meghan doesn’t just represent the hard launch of Duchess of Sussex’s new career as a Martha Stewart-style lifestyle inspo guru; it might also be the final thing she makes for Netflix.</em></strong></p>

<p>Back in 2021, the spouses signed a five-year deal with the streaming service worth $100 million, with executives hoping it would lead to one hit show after another.</p>



<p>Instead, last year introduced viewers to Polo, a behind-the-scenes look at a sport not exactly well known or beloved around the world.</p>



<p>Neither Harry nor Meghan appeared on screen.</p>



<p>The show came and went and we bet almost no one reading this at the moment even knew it existed.</p>

<p>Prior to this release, there was 2023’s documentary Heart of Invictus, which also had limited appeal. </p>



<p>Outside the Netflix contract, there was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-ruined-her-spotify-podcast/">Meghan’s bizarre podcast</a>, Archetypes, which ran for 12 episodes in 2022 and was the grand total of the couple’s $20 million Spotify deal.</p>



<p>When it comes to Markle&#8217;s solo series here, Heritage mocks the content for featuring almost nothing but a &#8220;woman filling children’s party bags with seeds and manuka honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continues to trash the former actress by stating:</p>



<p><em><strong>The thirsty part of Meghan still exists.. it’s evident in her decision to rebrand herself in With Love, Meghan. The problem is that nobody wants to see Meghan making decorative ladybird crostini with Mindy Kaling. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>With Love, Meghan is the sort of gormless lifestyle filler that, had it been made by the BBC, would be used to bulk out episodes of Saturday Kitchen</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Previously, Meghan McCain made it clear <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-mccain-i-absolutely-hate-meghan-markle/">how much she hates Meghan Markle</a>.</p>



<p>Five years after ditching The Royal Family, Markle&#8217;s reputation has never been worse.</p>



<p>Writing that Harry and Meghan are most appealing when they&#8217;re &#8220;whining,&#8221; Heritage concludes that they should aim to be reality stars along the lines of those who starred in various MTV shows in the early and mid-2000s.</p>



<p><em><strong>There are rumours that Netflix may not cut its losses with the Sussexes completely, instead preferring to keep them on at a vastly reduced rate. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>This is good news for the content developed but not yet delivered, such as the adaptation of the novel Meet Me at the Lake, and possibly even their aborted animation show, Pearl. But mainly it’s good news for us. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>If this really is the last roll of the dice, then it may be time for Harry and Meghan to face the inevitable and become the new Osbournes.</strong></em></p>

<p>Executives at Bravo appear to have reached a decision when it comes to The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p>



<p>Fans of this franchise have been preparing for major changes for awhile now&#8230; ever since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-14-ends-in-total-chaos/">Season 14 ended in complete chaos</a>.</p>



<p>And not, like, fun, typical reality TV chaos, either.</p>



<p>The sort of behind-the-scenes chaos and confusion and left the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-canceled-ratings/">future of the show up in the air</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="927" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1024x927.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519521" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1024x927.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-300x272.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-768x696.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-2048x1855.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-960x869.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1080x978.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1441538271-1200x1087.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teresa Giudice attends the DSW holiday gifting season event at Glasshouse Chelsea on November 14, 2022 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for DSW)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to OK! Magazine, there <em>will</em> be a Season 15 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p>



<p>The cast will look very different, however.</p>



<p>“The three women Bravo has kept engaged are Melissa Gorga, Teresa Giudice and Dolores Catania,” the <a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/rhonj-season-15-cast-revealed/">tabloid reported this week</a>. </p>



<p>“The other women &#8212; Margaret Josephs, Danielle Cabral and Rachel Fuda &#8212; were not given retention notices, and, at this time, Bravo is not pursuing them for a spot on RHONJ or any other side projects.” </p>



<p>This same article alleges Fuda was a “strong contender&#8221; to return, but her husband stood in the way because he was &#8220;difficult to deal with behind the scenes and [producers] didn’t feel it was worth the headache.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519522" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2021272280-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga attends the 2024 People&#8217;s Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on February 18, 2024 in Santa Monica, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gorga and Giudice, of course, are sisters-in-law &#8212; but they have feuded for years, to such an extent that Gorga has trashed her relative as toxic and has said she&#8217;ll <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/melissa-gorga-ill-never-film-with-toxic-teresa-giudice-again/">never film with Giudice again</a>.</p>



<p>But “Bravo loves the dynamic her husband [Joe Gorga] brings to the show,&#8221; this magazine explains, adding of the logic for keeping Melissa around:</p>



<p>“They find him funny and think viewers enjoy watching him do shots and interact with the other men. This isn’t something they wanted to let go of just yet.”</p>



<p>How will it work then? How will Gorga and Giudice co-exist on the same program?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519524" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1498308633-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melissa Gorga attends the Vivint Smart Lighting Launch Party on June 13, 2023 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images for Vivint)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>They won&#8217;t have to, apparently.</p>



<p>“As far as where the women will wind up at this point, it’s looking likely RHONJ will be led by Melissa and Dolores, and Teresa will be given a spin-off,” OK! writes. </p>



<p>“While fans still want to likely see both Melissa and Teresa on RHONJ, there just isn’t a world where that has any chance of happening due to where things stood last season and continue to stand today.”</p>



<p>Interesting, huh? Would you tune in for a Teresa Giudice spinoff?</p>



<p>No one from Bravo itself has confirmed this rumor just yet, but we&#8217;ll keep readers apprised on the status of Season 15 when more news breaks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>As you may have heard, Saturday Night Live celebrated its 50th anniversary on Sunday night.</p>



<p>The show was generally well received, too, with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/ryan-reynolds-jokes-about-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-legal-battle-at-snl-50/">Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively making their first</a> public appearance since It Ends With Us Gate and with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kim-kardashian-pete-davidson-spotted-chatting-at-snl-50-afterparty-reconciliation-on-the-horizon/">Pete Davidson reuniting</a> with ex-lover Kim Kardashian.</p>



<p>But a bunch of people on social media are shaking their heads over one particular segment on the special.</p>



<p>And it featured Tom Hanks &#8230; of all, non-normally-controversial people.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="410" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22809-1739805497-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-519486" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22809-1739805497-1.webp 700w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22809-1739805497-1-300x176.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Hanks on the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary special.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (NBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The multiple-time Oscar winner made a cameo on the Black Jeopardy sketch, appearing as the character of a Donald Trump voter named Doug.</p>



<p>Wearing a Make America Great Again red baseball cap, Hanks jokingly refused to shake hands with Kenan Thompson (presumably due to his skin color) and acted in general like a dumb and racist doofus.</p>



<p>Just like the average Donald Trump supporter?</p>



<p>This seemed to be what Saturday Night Live was getting at, wouldn&#8217;t you agree?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519487" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson attend SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Trump, of course, just won the Presidency for the second time in November and was sworn in to the oval office on January 20.</p>



<p>He even won the popular vote this time around.</p>



<p>Like him, hate him or think he&#8217;s a wannabe dictator who hates poor people and minorities and has no concept of policy in any way, shape or form&#8230; one cannot argue that Trump has many fans out there.</p>



<p>Which is why many of them jumped on Instagram and Twitter in the wake of Hanks&#8217; SNL cameo and made their opinions on the sketch well known.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="875" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22853-1739806103-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-519488" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22853-1739806103-1.webp 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22853-1739806103-1-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here is a sampling of some of the harshest critiques:</p>



<p><em><strong>This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting.</strong></em> </p>



<p><em><strong>SNL acts like they get payouts from USAID too. DOGE should audit them.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong><em>SNL just went off my radar.</em></strong></p>



<p>Hanks did have some folks in his corner, however. To wit:</p>



<p><strong><em>Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor. He really captured the look and vacant eyes of MAGA cult folks.</em></strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Bless Tom Hanks. There’s not enough money on the planet for me to wear that stupid ass cap.</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>I saw someone complain about the bit with Tom hanks because it politicized the sketch…….. exactly what show do you think you’re watching.</strong></em></p>

<p>Laverne Cox has come out with a very important series at a very important time.</p>



<p><em>Clean Slate</em>, which premiered on Amazon Prime Video on February 6, stars the <em>Orange Is The New Black</em> alum alongside George Wallace.</p>



<p>Laverne reached deep into her own childhood pain to tell this humorous, uplifting story.</p>



<p>But she hopes that this will have a healing effect upon viewers. Especially now, at a time when her story is so painfully relevant.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Laverne Cox on 'Clean Slate.'" class="wp-image-518774" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0207_lavernecox_01-Cropped.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In &#8216;Clean Slate,&#8217; Laverne Cox stars as a woman reconnecting &#8212; and reintroducing herself to &#8212; her father in her hometown.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laverne-cox-and-george-wallace-star-in-clean-slate-on-prime">Laverne Cox and George Wallace star in &#8216;Clean Slate&#8217; on Prime</h2>



<p><em>Clean Slate</em> is a new series of Prime Video. The show stars Laverne Cox as Desiree, the estranged adult daughter of Harry Slate, portrayed by George Wallace.</p>



<p>Desiree returns to her small Alabama hometown where Harry lives and owns a car wash. Funding for her art gallery in New York has fallen through, and her visit home turns into an extended stay.</p>



<p>The catch is that she isn&#8217;t just playing catch-up on life events. She is a transgender woman, and until the moment of their reconnection, her father has only known her as his &#8220;son.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking to <em><a href="https://people.com/why-laverne-cox-wanted-to-retraumatize-herself-childhood-memories-clean-slate-exclusive-8787487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> alongside the premiere, Laverne expressed how using very real stories of what it means to be trans in our deeply transphobic society also means being able to &#8220;explore healing&#8221; and humor on the show.</p>



<p>Laverne explained how she took her own &#8220;contentious, conflicted relationship with home&#8221; and the &#8220;trauma of my childhood.&#8221; She then made them &#8220;quite hilarious for the show.&#8221;</p>



<p>Traditionally, real-life trauma is a major source of inspiration for comedy. That&#8217;s as true for<em> Clean Slate</em> as it is for the bulk of stand-up comedy. Ultimately, Laverne hopes that this is &#8220;healing for the audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though revisiting some aspects of her childhood was &#8220;triggering, almost every day,&#8221; Laverne Cox knows that it&#8217;s for a good cause. And not only in service of the show itself.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/06/entertainment/laverne-cox-trans-clean-slate-wrong-1-percent/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a> reported on her statements elsewhere about what it means to make a series like <em>Clean Slate</em> at a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the worst political figures</a> on the planet are using the LGBTQ+ community &#8212; and particularly the trans community &#8212; as a scapegoat and a malicious rallying cry.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">“In terms of the trans aspect of it, we’re experiencing the most intense backlash against trans visibility that I’ve seen in my lifetime,” Laverne acknowledged. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="George Wallace Shares His Modern Life Observations, Talks Clean Slate with Laverne Cox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bf95CPGyNQ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>“You know, the Republican Party spent $215 million on anti-trans ads in this last election,&#8221; Laverne Cox cited. &#8220;And if you watched, you would think the last election was about trans people and immigrants.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Executive orders limiting our rights, 26 states banned gender affirming care for young people, banning us from the military, from bathrooms,&#8221; she listed grimly. &#8220;There’s this whole anti-trans thing, and we’re less than 1% of the population.&#8221;</p>



<p>Referring to a recent response to the bigoted anti-trans backlash, Laverne noted: “Someone in my comment section said, ‘They’re worried about the wrong 1%.’” (The right 1% being billionaires, some of whom are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5289315/trump-week-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actively dismantling the US government</a> as we speak)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-re-worried-about-the-wrong-1">&#8216;They&#8217;re worried about the wrong 1%&#8217;</h2>



<p>“In 2025, as federal bans come down attacking trans people, what I love about this show and what I love about being an artist is that artists can be arbiters of empathy,” Laverne expressed. She pointed out that empathy “can foster humanity.”</p>



<p>She acknowledged: “Trans people have been so deeply dehumanized over the past several years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Laverne then affirmed: &#8220;Art, getting to know trans people as people, is a way to re-humanize.”</p>

<p>General Hospital Executive Producer Frank Valentini confirmed Charleson&#8217;s passing on the show&#8217;s official Instagram page on Sunday, January 12. </p>



<p>&#8220;It is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of my dear friend and colleague, Leslie Charleson,&#8221; he began, continuing as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;Her enduring legacy has spanned nearly 50 years on General Hospital alone and, just as Monica was the heart of the Quartermaines, Leslie was a beloved matriarch of the entire cast and crew. I will miss our daily chats, her quick wit and incredible presence on set. </p>



<p>&#8220;On behalf of everyone at General Hospital, my heartfelt sympathy goes out to her loved ones during this difficult time.&#8221;</p>

<p>A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Charleson earned a mahor break in 1964 when she scored a recurring role on the daytime drama A Flame in the Wind. </p>



<p>Two years later, she became a regular on As the World Turns as Don Hughes’ stepdaughter, Alice Whipple. </p>



<p>From there, it was on to the program Love Is a Many Splendored Thing from 1967-1970 before she bounced around a bit and then ended up on General Hospital.</p>



<p>“I only signed on for two years, and I don’t know what happened,” the actress told Digital Journal in 2019. </p>



<p>“Back then, there weren’t a lot of good female roles that had that. It was an amazing time, and it was strong material to act.”</p>

<p>As Monica, Monica Charleson made a name for herself by forming a super-couple with the late Stuart Damon, who played her better half/sparring partner, fellow doctor Alan Quartermaine. </p>



<p>There was also a famous breast cancer storyline and accidental affair with her nephew, Ned. </p>



<p>“Monica’s battle with breast cancer was just so incredibly fulfilling,” Charleson told FBJ Fit in 2020. </p>



<p>“Dealing with a real-life issue that afflicts so many women and their families and being able to show the struggle and issues they face, was something I am so proud of. It was exhausting and incredibly difficult work, but the response to the storyline was truly humbling.&#8221;</p>

<p>While appearing on General Hospital, Charleson was still able to occasionally guest star on shows such as Friends and Dharma &amp; Greg. She also headlined the TV movie Woman On the Ledge.</p>



<p>Looking back at her General Hospital run, the late actress told Soap Opera Digest in 2001: </p>



<p>“I really do love this job. Look at it this way &#8212; what better job can you do than get up in the morning, roll out of bed, throw something on and then have someone take care of how you look and how you dress and what you say? </p>



<p>&#8220;How much more grateful could you possibly be? Not bad, not bad at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>On November 23, Chad Duell &#8212; who has portrayed Michael Corinthos on General Hospital for 14 years &#8212; confirmed is walking away from the ABC soap opera.</p>

<p>The actor Duell took fans and followers by extreme surprise when he announced this news in an Instagram post on Saturday, writing: </p>



<p>“After many incredible years with General Hospital, I’ve decided to step away from the show. </p>



<p>&#8220;This wasn’t an easy decision for me, but it feels like the right time in my life. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m beyond grateful to Frank Valentini, the cast, crew, and everyone behind the scenes who have been like family to me throughout this amazing journey.”</p>

<p>It sounds as if the split is amicable, although Duell didn&#8217;t provide any further details behind his decision.</p>



<p>Duell concluded his statement with a message to his supporters.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your unwavering support and for letting Michael Corinthos be a part of your lives,” he wrote. </p>



<p>“Your love and encouragement has meant the world to me. This isn’t a goodbye — it’s a see you later.”</p>

<p>Duell appeared on an episode of The CW&#8217;s Arrow in 2020 and installments of The Suite Life on Deck and Wizards of Waverly Place back in 2008.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a seven-time Daytime Emmy nominee, most recently having earned a nomination in 2023 for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Daytime Drama Series.</p>



<p>He won a Daytime Emmy in 2015 for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.</p>



<p>General Hospital producer Frank Valentini, meanwhile, revealed on Twitter over the weekend “there are no plans to recast [Duell’s] role at this time.”</p>



<p>“I have loved working with Chad over the years and wish him nothing but the best. He is a terrific actor and will be missed by everyone at #GH,” Valentini wrote on social media. </p>



<p>“There are no plans to recast his role at this time, but you never know in daytime. I can promise a great story for Michael and his family when Chad exits in the new year.”</p>

<p>Sophie Skelton is a fan favorite as Brianna Fraser on the Starz drama <em>Outlander,</em> but fans are hoping to see her pop up in another iconic franchise. </p>



<p>Many <em>Harry Potter </em>fans have named Sophie as their top choice to play the Boy Who Lived&#8217;s mom, Lily Potter (née Evans), in a new series. </p>

<p>While nothing has been set for an upcoming <em>Harry Potter </em>series, fans can see Sophie playing another iconic redhead on <em>Outlander</em>, which returns soon. In the meantime, dive into some of the fan-casting theories!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-want-sophie-skelton-as-lily-potter">Fans Want Sophie Skelton As Lily Potter</h2>



<p>Since the original <em>Harry Potter </em>films ended in 2011, many Potterheads share actors they&#8217;d like to see in a reboot. Sophie&#8217;s name has come up for Lily in various adaptations in recent years.</p>



<p>Scrolling through fan communities on sites like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/104w5q3/my_fancast_for_harry_potters_kidswhat_you_guys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/sapphicwhxre/651694131043762176/sophie-skelton-as-lily-potter-n%C3%A9e-evans-not-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/sophie-skelton-talking-about-lily-evans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>, many people name the <em>So Awkward </em>actress in their fan casts. Many people share screen grabs from <em>Outlander </em>to emphasize just how perfect Sophie would be as Lily.</p>



<p>The fans feel that she looks the part of a young Lily Potter. Some online folks have suggested that she would be a great fit in an adaptation set during the &#8220;Marauders&#8221; era, when Harry&#8217;s parents were at Hogwarts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sophie-skelton-s-reaction-to-the-fan-casts">Sophie Skelton&#8217;s Reaction To The Fan Casts</h2>



<p>Sophie addressed the fans&#8217; desire to see her as Lily in an appearance on Oliver and James Phelps&#8217; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K1Ldcynk94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a><em> Normal Not Normal</em>. The twin actors notably played Fred and George Weasley in the original <em>HP </em>films. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>One of the twins mentioned that he&#8217;d seen her name floated for Lily Potter while in the middle of the interview. He seemed particularly amused about her connection to the Wizarding World.</p>



<p>She explained her theory as to why fans want to see her as &#8220;Harry&#8217;s mum.&#8221; Sophie cited one of the key physical attributes of Brianna Fraser.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s &#8217;cause my character has red hair. So, I&#8217;m a faux-redhead, like you two, I suppose. So, most of the stuff I get tagged in is Lily Potter fan cast,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>She continued to say that many people have used clips of her in <em>Outlander </em>for edits, and many people have even photoshopped her in some Hogwarts swag.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always been sort of rumored about, and then, it&#8217;s just kind of snowballed a lot, I think, over the years. There&#8217;s a lot of photo edits of Brianna, changing into Lily,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of pictures out there of me with Gryffindor scarves and things. I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Cool, honorary Gryffindor for the time being. I&#8217;ll take it,'&#8221; she continued. </p>



<p>Sophie clearly didn&#8217;t seem bothered by the comparisons. In fact, she embraced the idea of getting to be a redhead again. She seemed honored by the fact that fans would want to her in that role.</p>



<p>&#8220;One day, who knows? If there&#8217;s a sort of prequel to the movies, I&#8217;ll put the red wig back on and do that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-upcoming-harry-potter-series">Upcoming &#8216;Harry Potter&#8217; Series</h2>



<p>Even though <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 </em>premiered in 2011, fans have had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/10/jk-rowling-to-release-new-harry-potter-story-on-halloween-which/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ample opportunities </a>to return to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/10/jk-rowling-hints-at-new-harry-potter-book-on-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Wizarding World</a>. From <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/10/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-sequel-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </a></em>on Broadway to the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies, there&#8217;s no shortage of ways to get your<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/07/jk-rowling-brings-harry-potter-back-in-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Harry Potter </em>fix.</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a &#8220;Marauders&#8221; series in the works, but fans will get the chance to see the Boy Who Lived brought to the small screen in the near future. </p>



<p>Warner Bros announced plans to reboot the franchise as a TV series on HBO&#8217;s MAX streaming platform, per <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a></em>. The series is expected to premiere in 2026. Each season will be based on one of the books.</p>



<p>Casting has not been announced, but it&#8217;s possible for Sophie to appear as Lily Potter. Even though Lily and Harry&#8217;s father James are dead at the series&#8217; beginning, they do appear in some key scenes. </p>



<p>Harry&#8217;s parents appear in key moments throughout the series, like the Mirror of Erised or in the graveyard when Lord Voldemort returns. There are also opportunities for flashbacks throughout the series.</p>



<p>As for a &#8220;Marauders&#8221; series, fans will simply have to keep dreaming for a spinoff.</p>
