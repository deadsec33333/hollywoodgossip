<p>Are Karl Urban and Keith Urban related to each other? The Hollywood stars share much more than just a last name. </p>



<p>One glaring difference between the pair? Their careers in tinsel town. </p>



<p>Karl Urban is best known for his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/08/karl-urban-to-star-wars-thanks-but-no-thanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film and television roles</a> while Keith Urban is an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-celebrate-their-11th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning country music</a> artist. </p>



<p>But, do the two Urban&#8217;s share any DNA? Let&#8217;s dig in and find out. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-1024x683.jpg" alt=" Keith Urban attends The 2024 Met Gala " class="wp-image-502063" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Keith Urban attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-karl-amp-keith-share-more-than-the-urban-name">Karl &amp; Keith Share More Than The Urban Name</h2>



<p>Karl, 52, and Keith, 56 also happen to share a homeland: New Zealand&#8217;s north island.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Boys&#8221; star is originally from the country&#8217;s capital, Wellington, located in the southwest region on the bottom tip of the island. Meanwhile Keith is from WhangƒÅrei, which is located all the way at the top of the island. </p>



<p>And, while this has nothing to do with being related, both men have two children. Keith, who married Nicole Kidman in 2006, has two daughters with the Aussie actress: Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith, 13.</p>



<p>Karl has two sons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from his marriage to Natalie Wihongi</a>: Hunter, 23, and Indiana, 18. Unfortunately, Karl and Natalie divorced in 2014 after ten years together. </p>



<p>Despite all of these shared traits, Karl and Keith are not actually related in any way. It seems this just might be a series of several coincidences for the pair of &#8220;K&#8221; name celebs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-big-differences-between-karl-amp-keith">Two Big Differences Between Karl &amp; Keith</h2>



<p>Fans of country crooner Keith will know that he&#8217;s better known as an Australian star due to the fact <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Keith-Urban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he moved from NZ</a> when he was just two years old. </p>



<p>Another thing keeping the pair from any possible relation? Keith&#8217;s real last name is spelled differently: Urbahn.</p>



<p>Keith has never spoken about why he changed the spelling of his name, but <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/keith-urban-real-name-closer-think.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some have speculated</a> it was done to make the pronunciation easier to remember.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-karl-urban-is-an-only-child">Karl Urban Is An Only Child</h2>



<p>Though Keith has a brother, Shane Urban, Karl doesn&#8217;t have any siblings. </p>



<p>Karl&#8217;s parents were German immigrants living in New Zealand where his mother&#8217;s career in a film production rental company helped spark his acting career. He even spoke fondly of attending screenings as a child during an interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was not only enamored with these films, but the culture of the crew and the way they interacted,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/karl-urban-going-great-guns/ZSDWYQVEBY7YPSBR54Z4PRIBVU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the NZ Herald</a> in 2010. &#8220;I was hooked.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thankfully it all worked out as he now has <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881631/fullcredits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">59 credits on his IMDb page</a> as well as being the star of Amazon Prime&#8217;s original series &#8220;The Boys&#8221; which premiered its fourth season on June 13. </p>

<p>In an interview with IGN,<a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/03/star-treks-bones-karl-urban-on-why-he-would-never-do-a-star-wars-movie-and-hopes-for-an-original-story-for-star-trek-3"> Karl Urban</a> was asked if he would attempt to leverage his working relationship with J.J. Abrams into a role in the new <i>Star Wars.¬†</i>Somewhat surprisingly, Urban replied with an immediate &#8220;No, absolutely not.&#8221;</p>

<p>When pressed further, Urban admits that he is a huge <i>Star Wars</i> fan. So huge in fact that he feels it would be wrong for the¬†<em>Star Trek</em> and¬†<em>Star Wars</em> worlds to intermingle.¬†</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;I, as an audience member, wouldn&#8217;t want to see an actor from¬†<em>Star Trek</em> in¬†<em>Star Wars</em>. I just wouldn&#8217;t. When I go into a¬†<em>Star Wars</em> movie I want to be completely enveloped. I don&#8217;t want to be taken out of the picture by going &#8216;Oh my God, there&#8217;s Scotty, what&#8217;s he doing in¬†<em>Star Wars?'&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Well put Mr. Urban. You know who agrees with Karl Urban on this?</p>
<p>Everyone.¬†</p>
<p><em>Star Wars¬†</em>and¬†<em>Star Trek:</em> Two different things since 1977. Let&#8217;s keep it that way.</p>
