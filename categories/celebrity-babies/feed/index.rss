<p>Is Carrie Underwood pregnant?</p>



<p>The former <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/katy-perry-american-idol-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a></em> champion has become one of the music world&#8217;s most beloved stars, and fans are always clamoring for new information about her personal life.</p>



<p>And while she values her family&#8217;s privacy, Carrie posts to social media frequently, and she&#8217;s usually happy to share updates about her time away from the recording studio.</p>



<p>But while fans might continue to bombard her with questions about whether or not she plans to expand her family, Carrie has mostly kept quiet on that issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-kids-does-carrie-already-have">How Many Kids Does Carrie Already Have?</h2>



<p>Carrie married hockey player Mike Fisher in 2010, and the couple has since welcomed two children.</p>



<p>And while Carrie has never explicitly stated that she&#8217;s done having kids, it looks as though she&#8217;s satisfied with the current size of her family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-carrie-underwood-pregnant-today">Is Carrie Underwood Pregnant Today?</h2>



<p>It does not look as though Carrie Underwood is currently pregnant, and based on her comments on the subject, it seems that she&#8217;s not planning to welcome another kid anytime soon.</p>



<p>During a 2019 appearance on <em>Today</em>, <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/505203/carrie-underwood-baby-number-three-pregnancy-comments-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie was asked point-blank</a> if she plans to welcome more kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not know at this point,&#8221; she told host Natalie Morales (via <em>Hello!</em>). </p>

<p>&#8220;You know, it&#8217;s such a difficult road to get where we are now. And I&#8217;ll have to evaluate after this tour is over,&#8221; the country star continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then we can talk about what&#8217;s next. But I&#8217;ve been a lot of kind of &#8216;live in the moment&#8217; lately. And I think that&#8217;s good. I am kind of a planner and I really do like knowing what&#8217;s around every corner.</p>



<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anything the past couple of years have taught me is that you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gonna happen next.&#8221;</p>



<p>With all of the ups and downs she&#8217;s endured in her life, Carrie can speak from experience about the futility of planning too far ahead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrie-s-difficult-pregnancy-journey">Carrie&#8217;s Difficult Pregnancy Journey </h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/09/carrie-underwood-opens-up-about-trio-of-heartbreaking-miscarriag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie suffered three miscarriages</a> in between the births of her two sons, and she&#8217;s been candid about the heartbreak of those tragedies.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way you can plan for everything or make everything be the way you want it,&#8221; she once said.</p>



<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s been good for me to just kind of be present, and live in the moment, and stop trying so hard to plan out the entire rest of my life.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/08/carrie-underwood-im-too-darn-old-to-have-more-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie has hinted that she might one day adopt a child</a>, but it seems that at the moment, she&#8217;s fully focused on her career and her two sons.</p>

<p>&#8220;This tour, I&#8217;m going home a lot more than I ever have before. If there&#8217;s a way to get me home, even if it&#8217;s just for the day,&#8217; she said at the time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-carrie-underwood-still-married">Is Carrie Underwood Still Married?</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Carrie has been married to Mike Fisher for quite some time.</p>

<p>Mike stood by his wife&#8217;s side when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/carrie-underwood-face-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie injured her face</a> in an accident in 2023, and it looks as though these two have never been stronger.</p>

<p>These days, Carrie&#8217;s career is reaching new heights, and Mike seems more than happy to provide all the support she needs.</p>



<p>Yes, it sounds like Carrie has achieved the ideal balance between her career and her family life.</p>



<p>And while she hasn&#8217;t completely closed the door on welcoming another child, it seems that she&#8217;s perfectly content with her current situation.</p>

<p>First came love, then came marriage, but a pregnant Gwen Stefani? Is that really a possibility?</p>



<p>Ever since Gwen and Blake Shelton got together, fans have been eager for them to start a family of their own.</p>



<p>Rumors have been flying for years, with “sources” suggesting everything from medical miracles to secret pregnancies and beyond.</p>



<p>On the flip side, there have also been reports that the pair are <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-marriage-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headed for a split</a>, but we choose to ignore that noise. </p>



<p>So, is Gwen Stefani, who turns 55 in October, pregnant? Let’s discuss what we know.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwen-stefani-amp-blake-shelton-love-being-parents-nbsp">Gwen Stefani &amp; Blake Shelton Love Being Parents&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-super-bowl-2024-divorce-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started dating </a>in late 2015, shortly after both of them divorced their respective spouses.</p>



<p>While they seemingly had nothing in common, it was clear from the start that they were perfectly aligned when it came to the importance of family.</p>



<p>Gwen gave birth to three children with her ex, Gavin Rossdale: Kingston, Zuma and Apollo.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Blake had no children of his own with his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. In fact, some insiders suggested that the lack of kids was the reason for their split.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the moment Blake joined the family, it was clear he was eager to be a role model for Gwen’s boys and took to being a “stepdad” even before it was official.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, he&#8217;s become such a mentor to the boys, he&#8217;s even started helping them launch their own <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/gwen-stefani-son-zuma-blake-shelton-bar-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">musical careers</a>! How about that! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-gwen-stefani-pregnant-with-blake-shelton-s-child">Is Gwen Stefani Pregnant with Blake Shelton’s Child?</h2>



<p>Cards on the table: no, Gwen isn’t pregnant. At least, not that she has announced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not completely out of the question that these two will still have a kid together &#8211; especially since they have been trying for over 7 years!</p>



<p>Gwen and Blake did not get married until 2021, but for years before that, it was reported that the pair were “hyper-focused on getting pregnant.”</p>



<p>Insiders close to the couple told outlets like <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-focused-on-getting-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> that their bond was so strong, Blake and Gwen put having a kid ahead of getting married for many years.</p>

<p>“They believe there is still a chance for Gwen,” said an Shelton insider. “They are incredibly hopeful.”</p>



<p>Despite having 3 successful pregnancies, Gwen was in her late 40’s when she started dating Blake. While celebs like Janet Jackson welcomed children into their 50’s, insiders explained that Gwen needed some help if she was going to conceive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gwen would love to get pregnant, things with Blake are so perfect, having a baby with him would be the icing on the cake.,” a Gwen insider told <em>HollywoodLife.com.</em> </p>



<p>“She’s a big believer in alternative medicine so she wants to do it in the most natural way possible. She’s been getting acupuncture and working with a Chinese herbalist to increase her fertility.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as we know, as of 2024, any attempts to have a baby have not proven fruitful yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, there is always adoption and surrogacy. And ,with them both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/blake-shelton-announces-departure-from-the-voice-after-season-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">off <em>The Voice</em></a> now, there would be no real time to focus on a family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwen-stefani-loves-being-a-mother-nbsp">Gwen Stefani Loves Being A Mother&nbsp;</h2>



<p>“I waited my whole life to be a mom. That&#8217;s all I wanted, my entire life”</p>



<p>The rock star mom appeared on a 2024 episode of <a href="https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/"><em>The Skinny Confidential Him &amp; Her Show</em></a>&#8216;s podcast, and she discussed how hard it was to juggle her kids while working, even though she loved being a mom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From working on her solo album to touring with No Doubt, Kingston was always by her side.</p>



<p>&#8220;It just felt so real and right. I got so ripped off on that tour because I was so sick. I ended up taking the baby when he was 9 months and going and doing a world tour, like 120 shows &#8230; We&#8217;re in a hotel one day and I thought that I had to stop nursing because I was like, &#8216;How am I going to nurse and be on stage?'&#8221;</p>

<p>With all that said, Gwen had thought, once upon a time, that she was too old to have another child. Then her oldest,&nbsp; Kingston started asking her to have another sibling.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m too old. I&#8217;m not having any more babies. I&#8217;m sorry, love,&#8217; &#8221; she said. &#8220;He just wanted a baby, so he would start praying every night for this baby. Four weeks later, praying every night like, &#8216;Please, let my mom have a baby,&#8217; and I&#8217;m pregnant with Apollo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gwen calls that pregnancy a miracle. She also admits she’s been lucky enough to have 3 miracles happen in her lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;[Hosting <em>The Voice</em>] was the second miracle. The first miracle was getting pregnant. The second was <em>The Voice</em>.

<p>Shortly after getting hitched, Margaret opened up about her future family plans in a <em><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a45206958/margaret-qualley-interview-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper&#8217;s Bazaar</a> </em>interview, published in September 2023. &#8220;Qualley has always wanted to get married and have kids,&#8221; the profile noted.</p>



<p>In the interview, <em>The Substance </em>star opened up about visiting a friend who recently had a child shortly after she and Jack started dating. She admitted that she snapped photos of herself in a wedding dress, while holding a baby.</p>

<p>Before Margaret connected with the <em>Strange Desire </em>singer, she had a string of relationships with other celebrities.</p>



<p>The actress&#8217;s first public romance was with fellow actor Nat Wolff. They first connected while filming <em>Palo Alto</em>, but they split up by August 2017, according to<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/margaret-qualleys-complete-dating-history-through-the-years-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Us Weekly</em>. </a></p>



<p>Margaret was tied to comedian Pete Davidson back in late 2019. The pair&#8217;s romance came after the funny man <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/pete-davidson-on-ariana-grande-she-dumped-me-because-mac-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke off his engagement</a> with Ariana Grande. He also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-and-kate-beckinsale-are-so-cute-toge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a brief fling</a> with Kate Beckinsale before linking up with Margaret.</p>



<p>It was reported that <em>The Leftovers </em>star and the <em>SNL </em>alum had been dating for a few months in August 2019, per <em><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29020403/pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-relationship-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a></em>. They were spotted together a few times that fall.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s mom actually spilled some details about their love. Andie MacDowell gushed about the young couple in a September 2019 interview with <em><a href="https://people.com/movies/andie-macdowell-margaret-qualley-pete-davidson-beautiful-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;She has a beautiful relationship with him but I don’t want to step on her relationship too much,&#8221; she told the outlet. Thanks, Mom! Unfortunately, a few weeks later, the pair called it quits.</p>



<p>In 2020, Margaret started dating Shia LeBeouf after appearing in her sister Rainey&#8217;s music video alongside him. In 2021, the pair split up after indie singer FKA Twigs filed a lawsuit for assault and sexual battery against Shia.</p>



<p>Shia has denied the allegations. The actress has shown support for FKA Twigs on social media and in interviews. &#8220;It was important to me for her to know that I believe her. It’s as simple as that,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%252Fculture%252Ffeatures%252Fa37628922%252Fmargaret-qualley-october-2021%252F%26sref%3D%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshia-labeouf-margaret-qualley-fka-twigs-abuse-b1928938.html&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshia-labeouf-margaret-qualley-fka-twigs-abuse-b1928938.html&amp;article_id=1928938&amp;author=Ellie+Harrison&amp;tag=Margaret+Qualley%2CShia+LaBeouf%2CFKA+Twigs%2Candie+macdowell§ion=TV+%26+Radio&amp;category=News&amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;updated_time=2021-09-29T06%3A41%3A49.000Z&amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;ref=www.independent.co.uk&amp;utm_source=independent&amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;gclid=N%2FA&amp;trx-iid=iid1740344487605fjf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper&#8217;s Bazaar </a></em>in 2021. </p>

<p>The newborn joins the three kids Rachel shares with husband John Fuda: daughters Gianella Jolie, 4, and Giuliana Rose, 2, as well as Jaiden &#8230; John’s 18-year-old son from a previous relationship, whom Rachel adopted.</p>



<p>Added the Bravo personality to People:</p>



<p>&#8220;Our hearts are fuller, our home is brighter — our baby boy is here, and I am so grateful to be a mother again.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Fuda, the spouses used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to get pregnant, the same process they used to conceive Gianella and Giuliana. </p>



<p>&#8220;We always had the room for one more in our home and in our hearts, and we&#8217;re both just so happy to be welcoming another baby into the family. It felt like it was time,&#8221; Rachel also told People in August, back when she confirmed her expecting again.</p>

<p>This exciting personal development comes amid a difficult professional rumor surrounding Fuda and others.</p>



<p>Based on a recent OK! Magazine report, there <em>will</em> be a Season 15 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. But it will not include certain cast members.</p>



<p>Margaret Josephs, Danielle Cabral and Rachel Fuda were not given retention notices, and, at this time, Bravo is not pursuing them for a spot on RHONJ or any other side projects,&#8221; wrote this tabloid a few days ago.</p>



<p>This same article alleges Fuda was a “strong contender” to return, but her husband stood in the way because he was “difficult to deal with behind the scenes and [producers] didn’t feel it was worth the headache.”</p>



<p><em>Yikes</em>, huh? Let&#8217;s hope his new son never reads that paragraph.</p>

<p>Is Rihanna pregnant and welcoming baby #3 in 2025? </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/rihanna-welcomes-second-child-insiders-hint-at-another-unique-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rihanna welcomed her second child</a>, a boy named Riot, in 2023.</p>



<p>The new addition joined Rihanna and A$AP Rocky&#8217;s first son, who sports the similarly unique name of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/rihanna-reveals-infant-sons-very-surprising-name-reminds-world-that-wu-tang-is-for-the-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RZA</a>.</p>



<p>With two kids under the age of three, Rihanna and Rocky obviously have a lot on their plate these days.</p>



<p>But it seems that RiRi might already be thinking about expanding her family even further.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rihanna-pregnant-again-did-she-actually-reveal-plans-for-another-baby">Rihanna Pregnant Again: Did She Actually Reveal Plans For Another Baby?</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with this: if Rihanna is pregnant again, she has not officially announced it. </p>



<p>But — and this is a really big BUT — she can&#8217;t stop talking about having a third kid either! </p>



<p>When asked by <em><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1391745/proof-rihanna-already-has-baby-no-3-on-the-brain-months-after-welcoming-son-riot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a> </em>around Christmas 2023 if there&#8217;s anything that she hasn&#8217;t done in her long and illustrious career, Rihanna jokingly replied, &#8220;So far, have daughters.&#8221;</p>



<p>Remember, she has two boys! The precursor of &#8220;so far&#8221; suggests that she&#8217;s not done trying for kids. In fact, she&#8217;s already worked out the odds of having a girl next time. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m batting at 75 percent for a boy next time. So, we&#8217;ll just keep our fingers crossed,&#8221; she added.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rihanna and ASAP Rocky attend the Off-White Womenswear Fall/Winter 2022/2023 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on February 28, 2022 in Paris, France." class="wp-image-497336" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1373646553-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rihanna and ASAP Rocky attend the Off-White Womenswear Fall/Winter 2022/2023 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on February 28, 2022 in Paris, France.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Now, while she didn&#8217;t share <em>immediate</em> plans about getting started on baby #3, but we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s a pregnancy announcement sometime in the next year or so.</p>



<p>She just loves being a mom so much!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-kids-does-rihanna-want">How Many Kids Does Rihanna Want? </h2>



<p>&#8220;I can’t believe I have two babies,&#8221; Rihanna told <em><a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/rihanna-is-ready-to-confess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview </a></em>magazine in their April 2024 cover story. </p>



<p>While covering everything from her music to her beauty line, Rihanna confessed that everything takes a backseat when it comes to her kids. </p>



<p>Including her style! Rihanna admits that these days, the boys&#8217; fashion choices are much more important than her own. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2179697325-1024x683.jpg" alt='Music Artist Rihanna attends "The City of Genius" of Moncler by the Huangpu river on October 19, 2024 in Shanghai, China.

<p>&#8220;I spend my time getting the kids dressed to death, and then I’m like, “What’s the most comfortable outfit to wear around them? What’s not going to feel uncomfortable on their face or on their body or make me feel like I can’t hold them properly?” Moms are lazy dressers in real life.&#8221;</p>



<p>In that same interview, Rihanna was asked just how many more kids she thinks she&#8217;ll have.</p>



<p>&#8220;As many as god wants me to have,&#8221; she confessed</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t know what god wants, but I would go for more than two. I would try for my girl. But of course if it’s another boy, it’s another boy.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rihanna-raising-future-entertainers">Rihanna Raising Future Entertainers!</h2>



<p>While more babies look promising in Rihanna&#8217;s future, what does the future look like for Rihanna&#8217;s babies?</p>



<p>When asked if she hopes that her kids will follow in her footsteps and enter the music world, Rihanna answered that the decision will be entirely up to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, my kids gonna have to get a job someday, right?&#8221; the 36-year-old explained while talking to E! News.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s up to them if they want to be involved. My kids might be like, ‘That&#8217;s a you thing, Mom, like, keep me — I don&#8217;t even want to be on camera.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added that her eldest child is already demonstrating some camera-shy tendencies.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how RZA acts right now,&#8221; she continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;He loves his reflection, but the minute he sees me with my phone, he&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m not entertaining you. Nope, nope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s our best creation so far. Nothing is better than that out there, any design.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-is-rihanna-pregnant-right-now">So, Is Rihanna Pregnant Right Now?</h2>



<p>In June of last year, Rihanna was once again asked about expanding her family by ET, who caught up with her at the launch of her new Fenty Hair collection.</p>



<p>After being asked again if she would have more kids, Rihanna responded, &#8220;You know what, I hope so. I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>When pushed, she made it clear that while baby #3 is on the brain, they are not in her immediate future. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not pregnant if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re asking,&#8221; she insisted, before doubling down. &#8220;I would definitely have more kids. </p>



<p>That was several months ago. But since there have been no new updates, we&#8217;re forced to conclude that Rihanna is not currently pregnant.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marriage-before-another-baby-carriage">Marriage Before Another Baby Carriage? </h2>



<p>There have been rumors of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/rihanna-and-aap-rocky-planning-a-secret-wedding-in-barbados/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rihanna and Rocky secretly getting married</a>, but if they <em>did</em> get hitched then they&#8217;ve done an impressive job of keeping it on the down-low.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the couple is still in the planning stage, but it seems just as likely that they&#8217;re holding off, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>After all, these two have a <em>lot</em> going on at the moment! (In addition to their kids and careers, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/asap-rocky-assault-trial-gets-underway-judge-calls-rappers-mom-beautiful-in-bizarre-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocky is currently on trial</a> for assault with a deadly weapon).</p>



<p>In the meantime, Rihanna is still cracking jokes about mom life. Ahead of the 2024 elections, she posted about using her son&#8217;s passport to vote.</p>



<p>Rihanna is a citizen of Barbados and is ineligible to vote in US elections. But she was obviously joking about using a toddlers&#8217; ID to commit voter fraud. When commenters criticized the post, RiRi clapped back as only she can:</p>



<p>“Shut up Karen,” she replied to one comment. “When yall stop burning ballot boxes come check me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Clearly, welcoming two kids hasn&#8217;t slowed her down in the slightest.</p>

<p>It’s going to be quite the 2025 for Megan Fox.</p>



<p>The&nbsp; Jennifer’s Body star announced she’s expecting another baby on November 11, her first with her boyfriend Machine Gun Kelly.</p>



<p>Despite rumors that the pair had split, Megan and MGK appear to be very much together given the news &#8211; and the fact that the Transformers star confirmed he was the father on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Less talking, more celebrating! Wait until you see this birth announcement!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-baby-4-on-the-way"><strong>Baby #4 on the Way!</strong></h2>



<p>Megan announced the news on Monday, November 11 on, where else, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCPh1gGzj9u/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, Sharing a carousel photos, she announced that she’s currently expecting.</p>



<p>“Nothing is ever really lost. welcome back,” she wrote in the caption, along with heart and angel emoji.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message calls back to the fact that Megan tragically suffered a miscarriage a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the photo carousel, she shared a snap where she was covered in oil while cradling her bump and a second of a positive pregnancy test. She also tagged MGK in the post, confirming he was the father.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-brood-nbsp"><strong>The Growing Brood&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>This new addition will be Megan’s 4th child to date. She already has 3 kids with her previous partner, Brian Austin Green.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s Noah, 11, Bodhi, 9, and Journey, 7.</p>



<p>As for MGK, the rapper welcomed daughter Casie, now 15, in 2009 with then-girlfriend Emma Cannon.</p>



<p>Since the pair started dating in 2020, they have been very involved parents, both with their own kids, as well as each others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No doubt that this baby will bring all of the kiddos together, even if they’ll all be a lot older!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-to-megan-and-mgk-stand-these-days"><strong>Where to Megan and MGK Stand these days?</strong></h2>



<p>Two years after they started dating, MGK proposed to Megan with quite the rock and quite the fanfare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2022, they’ve been through a roller coaster of relationship statuses, starting with the miscarriage.</p>



<p>After the proposal, MGK hinted that his love had experienced a pregnancy loss when he performed at the Billboard Music Awards and dedicated the set to their “unborn child.”</p>



<p>She then confirmed as much in her poetry book, “Pretty Boys Are Poisonous,” which hit bookshelves in November 2023.</p>



<p>She&nbsp; subsequently <a href="https://wwd.com/eye/people/megan-fox-poetry-book-hollywood-acting-miscarriage-fashion-love-1235948677/">told WWD</a> that the miscarriage was “difficult” to process.</p>



<p>“This miscarriage [was] really tragic for me and left me with a lot of grief and a lot of suffering,” she explained.</p>



<p>This was not Megan’s first loss as she previously experienced an ectopic pregnancy.</p>



<p>As for the pair, last we heard in March, their engagement was off and they had gone their separate ways. Megan confirmed as much, though insisted that they would always be in each other’s orbit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There will always be a tether to him no matter what. I can’t say what the capacity will be, but I will always be connected to him somehow,” she insisted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That seems to be the case! Congratulations to the couple. Here’s hoping this means you guys have it all figured out!</p>

<p>THIS JUST IN:</p>



<p>Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber sure do know how to make adorable babies.</p>



<p>Just about two months after the couple <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/justin-bieber-baby-name-why-did-the-singer-choose-jack/">welcomed their first child</a> into the world, a son named Jack, Hailey has done ahead and shared the very first photo of the pair&#8217;s newborn.</p>



<p>With a slight catch, that is.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512372" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1978679623-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Bieber takes part in the draft during 2024 NHL All-Star Thursday at Scotiabank Arena on February 1, 2024 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On Thursday, the 27-year old shared a new picture on Instagram of the VERY young man&#8230; as Hailey and Justin&#8217;s little boy sits is seen in a baby carrier, his two little feet peeking out.</p>



<p>Jack is rocking a a magenta onesie in snapshot, and on one foot has an &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker. </p>



<p>&#8220;Happy Halloween! Get out there and vote,&#8221; Hailey wrote over the image.</p>



<p>No, we can&#8217;t see Jack&#8217;s face. No, we probably won&#8217;t for a very long time. But he&#8217;s helping his parents send an important message with Election Day scheduled for November 5 and early voting underway in many states.</p>

<p>The singer revealed in a precious Instagram post in August that his wife had given birth to baby Jack.</p>



<p>&#8220;WELCOME HOME JACK BLUES BIEBER,&#8221; the artist wrote alongside a black and white photo of the newborn&#8217;s tiny foot at the time. </p>



<p>For those wondering, <em>Jack</em> is his father&#8217;s middle name.</p>



<p>It’s also tradition within the Bieber family to give members the initials <em>JB</em>.</p>



<p>There’s Justin Bieber… and his dad Jeremy Bieber… and Justin’s half-sister Jazmyn Bieber… and then his half-brother, Jaxon Bieber, 14.</p>

<p>Justin is fortunate to have a newborn at home and a loving wife; it&#8217;s been a rough few weeks for the star.</p>



<p>First, sources indicated that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/justin-bieber-completely-disgusted-by-diddy-accusations-report/">Bieber was disgusted to learn of Diddy&#8217;s arrest</a> and all the sordid details that have come out behind the rapper&#8217;s alleged sex trafficking crimes.</p>



<p>Bieber was also among the many celebrities who were <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/justin-bieber-tribute-liam-payne/">forced to mourn Liam Payne</a> last week after his shocking death in Argentina.</p>



<p>On October 21, Justin Bieber took to his Instagram Story to repost a tribute video for Liam Payne.</p>



<p>The footage features fans placing flowers, photos, and balloons in the memory of the late One Direction singer.</p>



<p>Bieber added his own caption, using an off-white font to write: “Rest easy, Liam&#8221; along with a white heart emoji.</p>

<p>After the Biebers welcomed their son, meanwhile, an insider told People Magazine that Bieber is &#8220;already a great dad,&#8221; adding this summer:</p>



<p>&#8220;The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for. The day they found out that Hailey was pregnant, was the best ever for Justin.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was over the moon with excitement. It was a big celebration for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We’ve always waited to name our children after meeting them, but with Billy, we fell in love with the name immediately &#8212; even before meeting him.</p>



<p>&#8220;We loved the gender neutrality in the name since we weren’t finding out the baby&#8217;s gender until delivery, which we’ve never done before. The name allowed us to feel connected to the baby without knowing the gender.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/the-secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-season-2-will-it-happen/">renewed by Hulu for Season 2</a>.</p>



<p>It takes viewers behind the scenes of marriages that are, let&#8217;s just say&#8230; unique.</p>



<p>On Season 1, we learned all about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/momtok-taylor-sex-party/">various kinds of swinging and sex parties</a> that drew global attention to the reality show.</p>



<p>Back to Whitney and Conner, however&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="370" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/7d2a5eb76bc0978ca2370376a0e934a5.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512034" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/7d2a5eb76bc0978ca2370376a0e934a5.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/7d2a5eb76bc0978ca2370376a0e934a5-300x173.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Whitney Leavitt has made an impression on Hulu subscribers.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The wife and husband were already parents to a 2-year-old son named Liam and a 4-year-old daughter named Sedona.</p>



<p>&#8220;Upon meeting Billy, they were a bit surprised that they actually didn’t get to decide the baby&#8217;s gender,&#8221; Leavitt laughed about to People. </p>



<p>&#8220;But they’ve warmed up to him quickly and now all they want to do is hold their new baby brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Leavitt joked that she&#8217;s a bit intimidated to have three car seats in one vehicle&#8230; but she may also have a bit more time on her hands to figure things out.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives Season 1, Whitney decided to leave MomTok. </p>



<p>That is, it sounds like, she heard about Season 2.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excited to film season 2 with all of you. I know there&#8217;s tough conversations ahead but I look forward to our journey together,&#8221; she texted her costars in a video shared to social media.</p>

<p>In a scene that reminded fans of how far Em has come since his chaotic early days in the spotlight, the bride and her father took to the dance floor for a traditional first dance at her wedding.</p>

<p>On YouTube, fans were quick to offer their congratulations to the grandfather-to-be.</p>



<p>“Eminem is a real one. Father goals. Congrats on being a grandfather,” one user commented.</p>

<p>“Eminem being a grandad is the most beautiful news I’ve ever heard today.

<p>“Thank you so much for sharing this with us, we know how private you are. this was so special and I feel so honored you shared this with your fans,” a third added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Musicians making tribute songs for their children is one of the purest things on earth, man love this so much,&#8221; a fourth chimed in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-mathers-family">The Growing Mathers Family</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s true that Eminem has gone to great lengths to guard his privacy in recent years.</p>



<p>(It&#8217;s a far cry from the days when he used to air his dirty laundry in deeply personal songs.)</p>



<p>But his daughter, host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/justalittleshadypodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Just a Little Shady&#8221;</a> podcast, is much more open.</p>



<p>For example, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/eminem-daughter-wedding-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailie and Evan got engaged</a> last year, they were quick to share their joy with fans.</p>

<p>In an interview with Hailie, <a href="https://people.com/eminem-tears-up-as-he-reveals-daughter-hailie-jade-is-pregnant-in-new-music-video-8722849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evan recalled the details</a> of the engagement.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw your dad go downstairs, and I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I gotta do it right now, or I&#8217;m not doing it today, and I&#8217;m gonna have to schedule another time,&#8217; &#8221; he remembered. </p>



<p>&#8220;So I just followed him downstairs, and, thankfully, he was just down there getting your cake and made it happen.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1439397290-1024x683.jpg" alt="Eminem performs onstage during the 37th Annual Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at Microsoft Theater on November 05, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Approaching Eminem to ask for permission to propose to his daughter sounds like a frightening experience.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in Evan&#8217;s case, it paid off.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t yet have any details about Hailie&#8217;s due date or how far along she is. But we&#8217;re sure the 28-year-old podcast host will spill the tea on her next episode.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we&#8217;d like to be the latest to offer our sincere congratulations to Hailie, Evan, and the artist soon to be known as Slim Grandpa.</p>

<p>Remember Octomom? Well, now she’s on her way to be Octograndma!</p>



<p>Nadya Suleman became an Internet sensation in 2009 after she gave birth to octuplets. Photos of her ran rampant, as did the fact that now she’s a mom of 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward a decade and change, and now Nadya is a grandmother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, one of her 10 sons has welcomed his first child &#8211; and the Octomo is over the moon!</p>

<p>“A beautiful gift!!</p>



<p>Nadya, 49, shared the first photo of her grandchild on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAPq4EeJGS_/">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a girl &#8211; name not given &#8211; and the photo showed the baby girl&#8217;s tiny foot peeking out from underneath a pink blanket.</p>



<p>Without revealing which one of her 10 sons had welcomed the baby, the new Nana wrote, &#8220;Thank you my son and my lovely daughter in law for giving us this beautiful gift! We are so blessed that she is a new addition to our family!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Baby girl you are so very loved and we can’t wait to watch you grow!! 8/30/24 ????????❤️,&#8221; she added, seemingly revealing the little one was born on Aug. 30.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-the-father-nbsp">Who Is The Father?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Now, folks who are good with math will notice that Nadya’s octuplets &#8211; Noah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, Josiah, Makai, Maliyah and Nariyah &#8211; are only 15 years as of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the Octomom was already a mom of six when she gave birth to the octuplets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their names are Amerah, Calyssa, Elijah, Caleb, Joshua and Aidan and they vary in age, some much older than their famous siblings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Case in point, a few weeks before she announced she was a grandma for the first time, she posted multiple <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-6SDabyC2w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">childhood snaps</a> of her son Joshua on Aug. 21 to mark his 21st birthday.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am so proud of the man you are becoming. You are smart, funny, hard working, loyal, humble, and now a devoted husband and soon to be father,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>And there is it! Joshua, at 21 years old, is the father of the new baby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone can relax now!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-octomom-up-to-these-days">What’s Octomom Up To These Days?</h2>



<p>Nadya has stayed out of the spotlight for the most part since 2013.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <a href="https://people.com/health/nadya-suleman-octomom-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to PEOPLE</a> in 2016 about her decision to walk away from her &#8220;Octomom&#8221; fame, Nadya confessed, “I had stopped wanting to do it from day one.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I was violating my boundaries and my value system and my own self. I didn’t think of it at the time because I was in survival mode, and I was doing whatever I possibly could to provide for my kids,” she continued.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s fairly understandable. What mom wouldn&#8217;t do whatever it took to make sure their kids had a future?</p>



<p>And now there&#8217;s a whole new generation to think about! </p>
