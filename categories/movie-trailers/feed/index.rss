<p>Alec Baldwin is very much in the <em>Rust </em>trailer, in case you were wondering how they&#8217;d handle that.</p>



<p>More than three years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/alec-baldwin-im-not-responsible-for-halyna-hutchins-death-if-i-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tragedy</a> struck the set of the Western film. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins lost her life.</p>



<p>Now, the trailer is out.</p>



<p>Watch the <em>Rust </em>teaser for yourself. A sense of unease permeates every moment &#8212; at least, if you know what happened.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1024x576.png" alt="Alec Baldwins on 'The Baldwins' during the series premiere." class="wp-image-520049" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_thebaldwins_01_alecbaldwin.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On the premiere episode of &#8216;The Baldwins,&#8217; Alec Baldwin had clearly seen happier times.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rust-trailer-is-out">The &#8216;Rust&#8217; trailer is out</h2>



<p>As you can see below, the <em>Rust </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6q3scsTwg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> is full of Western vistas, horses, tension, death, and old-timey shootouts.</p>



<p>Yes, some of it feels uncomfortably close to the tragedy that befell that film set.</p>



<p>And yes, Alec Baldwin takes center stage in multiple scenes in the trailer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Rust Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oc6q3scsTwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The film follows 13-year-old orphan, Lucas Hollister, who accidentally kills a Kansas rancher. He then has to go on the run with his grandfather, an aging outlaw who reemerges to protect the boy.</p>



<p>Patrick Scott McDermott plays Lucas. And Alec Baldwin plays his grandfather, Harland Rust.</p>



<p>The cast includes Travis Fimmel of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> and <em>Warcraft (2016)</em>, Frances Fisher, Josh Hopkins, and more.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Alec Baldwin at home on The Baldwins." class="wp-image-517885" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0127_thebaldwins_02-Cropped.png 1791w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On &#8216;The Baldwins,&#8217; Alec Baldwin seems to see some emotional ups and downs.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-filming-this-cost-halyna-hutchins-her-life">Filming this cost Halyna Hutchins her life</h2>



<p>Notably, the Rust credits honor the late Halyna Hutchins as cinematographer. </p>



<p>After her death, Bianca Cline stepped into the cinematographer role. Those were big shoes to fill.</p>



<p>Additionally, Halyna Hutchins&#8217; husband &#8212; now widower &#8212; Matthew Hutchins appears as Executive Producer. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="658" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1024x658.jpg" alt="Alec Baldwin on July 12, 2024." class="wp-image-522184" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-300x193.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-768x494.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-2048x1316.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-960x617.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1080x694.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0326_alecbaldwin_01-1200x771.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alec Baldwin gets emotional at the conclusion of his trial for involuntary manslaughter in First Judicial District Court on July 12, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ramsay de Give-Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Throughout the trailer, there is a palpable discomfort &#8212; and it has nothing to do with the trailer itself, which promises tension, violence, and warm moments.</p>



<p>But the rest of us are aware of the tragedy of Hutchins&#8217; death.</p>



<p>The world at large also knows of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/alec-baldwin-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious prosecutor</a> who seemed determined to put Alec Baldwin in prison over the senseless accident &#8212; so determined, it seems, that she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/alec-baldwin-shooting-trial-dismissed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sabotaged her own case</a>. (Judges as a rule do not enjoy when you allegedly commit Brady violations)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-a-film-s-quality-overcome-its-baggage">Can a film&#8217;s quality overcome its baggage?</h2>



<p><em>Rust </em>will hit theaters on May 2. There were, for obvious reasons, multiple delays.</p>



<p>The film has already premiered at the Camerimage Film Festival in Poland. The reviews seem to be fairly positive.</p>



<p>But the dismissal of Baldwin&#8217;s manslaughter charges did not undo <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/alec-baldwin-ptsd-rust-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his trauma</a>. Similarly, the specter of what took place on set hangs over the trailer for <em>Rust</em>. It&#8217;s unclear what sort of public reception the film will receive.</p>

<p>The first thing about this film that made us cringe, months ago, was Tom Cruise starring in it. He just isn&#8217;t likable.</p>
<p>Sure, plenty of his characters are likable, be himself isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s Scientology&#8217;s golden boy and he also tends to come across as <em>bonkers</em>.</p>
<p>And while he looks <em>great</em> for his age, he&#8217;s no longer in a place where he can rely on his looks to carry him.</p>
<p>At least, not with younger crowds who lack very specific <em>daddy issues</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the running joke about how Tom Cruise is &#8220;always running from things&#8221; in movies. There&#8217;s a ridicule factor.</p>
<p>Well, the reviewers had a <em>lot </em>to say.</p>

<p>Reviewers weren&#8217;t impressed by the newbie director who had been a writer on <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, <em>Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen</em>, and <em>Cowboys And Aliens</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, in a bunch of big movies that weren&#8217;t even a little bit good (did anybody else need to drink to get through <em>Into Darkness</em>? It wasn&#8217;t just an affront to everything that Star Trek represents, it was also just a bad movie).</p>
<p>But they also had some choice words about casting Tom Cruise in the lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never came to think of Cruise’s character as anything more than a lying cheat who would occasionally do the right thing,&#8221; said Daniel Krupa for <em>IGN</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine if there was only ever enough time to show the worst facets of Indiana Jones or Nathan Drake,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>So, basically, we have a protagonist who is at least as unlikable as Tom Cruise himself. That&#8217;s &#8230; not good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cruise is perfectly fine in an unchallenging role, but there isn’t enough time to make Nick into even a generic loveable rogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krupa&#8217;s description &#8230; just makes us want to watch the 1999 film again. <em>Those </em>were some lovable protagonists.</p>

<p>Sometimes, casting decisions seem to be made independently of what character someone&#8217;s playing.</p>
<p>Like, Chris Pratt is great on <em>Parks and Recreation</em> and in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but those are both lovable roles for a lovable actor.</p>
<p>He should not be playing predatory creeps like in <em>Passengers </em>or an unfriendly jerk like in <em>Jurassic World</em>. Those casting choices are wastes of Pratt.</p>
<p>Even some reviewers who seem to normally be able to enjoy Tom Cruise films didn&#8217;t love <em>The Mummy</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The Mummy </em>is the first Cruise-starring picture in decades in which his part seems like it could have been played by anybody,&#8221; said Bilge Elbiri for <em>The Village Voice</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only is <em>The Mummy</em> the worst movie that Tom Cruise has ever made, it’s also <em>obviously</em> the worst movie that Tom Cruise has ever made,&#8221; reports David Ehrlich for <em>Indiewire</em>.</p>

<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>It seems that even people who go to see it in theaters might not get to &#8220;see&#8221; much of the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a Dark Universe indeed. Other than the one bit set on a plane plummeting to Earth, the action scenes are shot in such low light that you can barely see what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; reviewed Jordan Hoffman for <em>Popular Mechanics</em>.</p>
<p>Ugh, we hate when things are filmed in <em>darkvision</em>. Even sepia is preferable.</p>
<p>Apparently the film&#8217;s one truly redeeming quality was the titular character &#8212; Princess Ahmanet, played by the beautiful and talented Sofia Boutella.</p>
<p>You might recognize Sofia from <em>Atomic Blonde</em> trailers or from <em>Star Trek Beyond</em>, and she&#8217;s a very likable actress.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also, according to some reviewers, the one bright point of the film. Just &#8230; not enough to save the whole thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easily the best part of the movie is Boutella,&#8221; says Sarah from <em>LaineyGossip </em>before continuing:</p>
<p>&#8220;She has such tremendous physicality that even though you can tell there’s some CGI polish applied, you can also tell that Boutella is really crawling around, contorting herself into broken mummy shapes that are easily the creepiest thing in the movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, at least, is a relief. Nobody watched <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em> for the protagonist &#8212; they went to see Queen Ravenna.</p>
<p>We did, anyway.</p>

<p>Look, I&#8217;m a huge fan of mummies and Ancient Egyptian stuff.</p>
<p>I know just enough Ancient Egyptian to have caught, like, six works when they were speaking in <em>The Mummy (1999)</em> and <em>The Mummy Returns</em>, and adored both of those goofy films.</p>
<p>I watched <em>Mummies Alive!</em> as a kid. I love the Dr. Kara Cooney documentary series <em>Out Of Egypt</em>.</p>
<p>So &#8230; this is disappointing, even on just a personal level.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing to fans of monster movies and of mummies and of films doing well.</p>
<p>And a <em>huge </em>disappointment for fans of the original films &#8230; even though not all of them were enthused about a reboot.</p>
<p>Perhaps most of all, it&#8217;s certainly a disappointment for the studio.</p>

<p>Of course, even bad movies do well at the box office. Like, <em>Dawn Of Justice</em> was basically unwatchable except when Wonder Woman was on screen, but it was a financial success.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound like this film&#8217;s, you know, <em>good</em>. But Boutella&#8217;s scenes might be worth watching &#8230; but maybe just in a YouTube supercut.</p>
<p>On the plus side, if this Dark Universe thing doesn&#8217;t pan out &#8230; at least maybe Johnny Depp won&#8217;t get to star in <em>The Invisible Man</em>.</p>
<p>Every time that Johnny Depp <em>isn&#8217;t</em> in a movie is a small victory, you know?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Johnny Depp may or may not have been involved in the Angelina Jolie-Brad Pitt divorce.</p>
<p>There may or may not be a chance that Depp and Jolie actually hook up in the wake of the latter&#8217;s split from her husband of two years.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s something we can say for certain about Depp:</p>
<p>He is most definitely NOT anywhere to be found in the first trailer for&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Disney has given fans of this franchise its first look at the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, dropped a teaser that focuses primarily in new villain Captain Salazar.</p>
<p>He will be played by Javier Bardem and he has an oddly polite message to send Depp&#8217;s Jack Sparrow in the following trailer.</p>
<p>(Sorry, Depp&#8217;s CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, we mean.)</p>
<p>But Depp&#8217;s absence from the preview is notable for two reasons:</p>
<p>First, can you imagine&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean without Johnny Depp?!?</p>
<p>His Oscar-nominated portrayal of the big screen&#8217;s most famous captain is the main reason why it found so much success in the first place&#8230; and why movies in this franchise continue to get made.</p>
<p>Depp will be featured prominently in the film, of course, but it seems like promotional suicide not to include him in the trailer.</p>
<p>This brings up to point number-two, however:</p>
<p>Is he not featured in the trailer due to the negative news that has been surrounding Depp for months?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In mid-August, <a href="/2016/08/amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-divorce-case-settled/">Depp settled his divorce case with Amber Heard</a>.</p>
<p>He gave the actress $7 million as part of the settlement and released a statement that seemed to admit to some bad behavior, most notably the part that read:</p>
<p>&quot;Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.&quot;</p>
<p>The resolution followed numerous accusations that Depp was physically and verbally abusive of his famous wife, often lashing out at her in drunken tirades.</p>
<p>One was even caught on film (by Heard) and it paints a very ugly picture of the veteran actor.</p>
<p>See for herself now:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/johnny-depp-goes-off-on-amber-heard-smashes-wine-bottle-in-shock"></a></figure>
<p>There was even talk that <a href="/2016/08/amber-heard-johnny-depp-cut-off-his-own-finger-accused-me-of-che/">Depp cut off his own finger</a> during one of these tantrums.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s certainly worth keeping an eye on just how Disney and Depp handle this delicate situation as the release date for&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales creeps closer and closer.</p>
<p>Will he make the media rounds?</p>
<p>Again, it would seem crazy for him not to appear on every possible talk show in order to promote this blockbuster.</p>
<p>But it also seems like his alleged history of domestic abuse would serve as a distraction as he did so.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In addition to Depp and Bardem, Orlando Bloom will reprise his role as Will Turner in the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie, while Geoffrey Rush returns to play Hector Barbossa.</p>
<p>New characters will include Carina Smyth, played by Kaya Scodelario; and Haifaa Meni, played by Golshifteh Farahani.</p>
<p>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales will be released on May 26, 2017.</p>

<p>Now out in theaters, the Disney film stars George Clooney and Britt Robertson, as their characters work together on a dangerous mission to uncover the secrets of a mysterious place called, aptly, Tomorrowland.</p>
<p>What are critics saying about the adventure?</p>
<p>Scroll down to find out, but consider yourself warned: The <a href="/2015/05/kim-kardashian-selfish-reviews-actually-positive/">Kim Kardashian&nbsp;Selfish reviews</a> are actually more positive&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/tomorrowland-trailer"></a></figure>
<p><em>Come for the humor and thrills and visual delights &#8211; there are many. Leave with the thought in your head: We can, we need to, do better. This is summer moviemaking at its best.</em> &#8211; Tom Long</p>
<p><em>Tomorrowland isn&#8217;t terrible but, given its potential to be great, I left the cinema feeling rather sad.</em> &#8211; Charlotte O&#8217;Sulliva</p>
<p><em>The plot of Brad (Ratatouille) Bird&#8217;s Tomorrowland is an incomprehensible muddle. A Wachowski screenplay reimagined by William Burroughs would be easier to follow.</em> &#8211; Brandon Judell</p>
<p><em>Has a futuristic vision that is stylishly and sometimes spectacularly rendered, but without much substance beneath the spectacle. </em>&#8211; Todd Jorgenson</p>
<p><em>An incredibly maudlin, preachy, annoyingly mercantile public service announcement aimed squarely at eight-year-olds.</em> &#8211; Kelly Vance</p>
<p><em>It is a Saturday morning matinee crossed with a Sunday service sermon but what really hits home is the thrill of the high-speed chases and the movie magic deployed to create a sense of awe and wonder.</em> &#8211; Allan Hunter</p>

A blast from the past is coming!!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jem and the Holograms is hitting the silver screen, and the trailer has arrived.</span> No, really. But hold it. Things aren&rsquo;t looking good.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/jem-and-the-holograms-trailer"></a></figure>
<p class="p2">With the&nbsp;release of the trailer yesterday though, there has been a backlash from 30-something-year-old fans of the original cartoon.</p>
<p class="p2">The live-action movie appears to be a loose interpretation of the story, reinventing Jem as some kind of YouTube sensation.</p>
<p class="p2">Whaaat? This isn&rsquo;t Justin freaking Bieber!</p>
<p class="p2">Only hours after the trailer premiered, viewers picked apart the inconsistencies between the original cartoon Jem and the Jem played by Aubrey Peeples.</p>
<p class="p2">Once a mega-popular cartoon, you would imagine there would be a lot of positive attention surrounding the upcoming <a href="/2015/02/jem-and-the-holograms-movie-first-photo/">Jem and the Holograms movie</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">But the trailer has five times as many down votes as up votes so far, and as of this morning, all of the top comments were negative critiques.</p>
<p class="p2">After watching the preview, I have to add to the negative criticism.</p>
<p class="p2">Where the f&#8211;k are Jem&rsquo;s magical, holographic projecting earrings???</p>

<p>He won Super Bowl MVP for the third time, he <a href="/2015/01/tom-brady-talks-about-balls-the-internet-giggles/">talked about deflated balls </a>in a way that made us all giggle, and, oh yeah, he&#8217;s still <a href="/2009/02/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-married/">married to Gisele</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the new <a href="/2015/01/ted-2-trailer-released-raunchy/">trailer for Ted 2</a> is to be believed, all of Tom Terrific&#8217;s impressive accomplishments pale in comparison to the&nbsp;game of inches that&#8217;s going on in his pants.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/ted-2-red-band-trailer"></a></figure>
<p>In the <em>very</em> NSFW red band clip above, Mark Wahlberg and his foul-mouthed&nbsp;ursine companion smoke a bong while watching Law &amp; Order, discuss the proper etiquette for public masturbation, and smoke a bong with Amanda Seyfried.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is a seriously 4/20-friendly flick, but more important than the weed is Brady&#8217;s peen, which is apparently as magnificent as his career.</p>
<p>Unlike his time in the NFL, however, Brady&#8217;s wang wasn&#8217;t aided by the tutelage of Bill Belichick. We hope.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the trailer above for some sage advice from Morgan Freeman and some hilariously WTF?! descriptions of Wahlberg&#8217;s porn collection.</p>
<p>As for the acting skills of the NFL&#8217;s (arguably) greatest QB, well, it&#8217;s better than the <a href="/2015/04/tom-brady-throws-out-first-pitch-should-not-consider-career-chan/">first pitch Brady threw out</a> at this year&#8217;s Red Sox home-opener, but the man definitely should not think about quitting his day job.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>What&#8217;s the opposite of selling out? Buying in? Because whatever it is, that&#8217;s what Johnny Depp is doing in the newly released trailer for the true-crime drama Black Mass:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/black-mass-trailer"></a></figure>
<p>Depp plays Whitey Bulger, the notorious Irish-American gangster who was brought to justice in 1999 after several decades of ruling the Boston crime world with an iron fist. (Jack Nicholson played a fictionalized version of Whitey in 2006&#8217;s The Departed.)</p>
<p>The film also stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Sienna Miller and Dakota Johnson, but judging from the trailer, it looks like Depp&#8217;s turn as Bulger will make or break this thing. And for the first time in a long time, it looks like he&#8217;s giving it his all.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, <a href="/2014/11/johnny-depps-drinking-is-driving-amber-heard-away-source-says-is/">Depp&#8217;s drinking</a> has reportedly gotten out of control in recent months, and insiders say his career choices and his personal life have suffered as a result.</p>
<p>Many hoped that after <a href="/2015/02/johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-married-on-the-beach/">Depp married Amber Heard</a> back in February, he&#8217;d begin to settle down a bit. (He is a 51-year-old father of two, after all.)</p>
<p>Instead, he&#8217;s seemed to be more off the rails than ever. Just yesterday, <a href="/2015/04/johnny-depp-resurfaces-hard-partying-to-blame-for-disappearance/">Depp resurfaced in Australia</a> after disappearing from the set of Pirates of the Caribbean 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, what&#8217;s more important to fans of the man&#8217;s work is the fact that his movies have sucked lately.</p>
<p>Anyone remember Transcendence? Mortdecai? Anyone chomping at the bit for more family-friendly drunk pirate wackiness in POC5?</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t think so. Now, a gritty gangster drama based on a real-life badass? There&#8217;s something we can sink our teeth into. Just don&#8217;t tell us what it&#8217;s marinated in.</p>
<p>Black Mass hits theaters on September 18.</p>

<p>This was not the <a href="/2014/11/star-wars-the-force-awakens-trailer-released/?PageSpeed=noscript">Force Awakens teaser</a> that was released back in November and forced fans to nitpick and argue over things like a three-pronged light saber.</p>
<p>No, the gem that hit the web yesterday was a two-minute glimpse into the future of one of the world&#8217;s most beloved franchises, and for the first time, we have a rough idea of what the year&#8217;s most anticipated movie will look like. (Sorry, <a href="/2014/10/avengers-age-of-ultron-trailer-its-apparently-here/">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>.)</p>

<p>Of course, the film is still five months away, and J.J. Abrams and company are savvy enough to whet our appetites without really telling us much of anything with regard to the plot.</p>
<p>As a result, the trailer leaves us with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>The big questions &#8211; such as what Luke Skywalker (who narrates the trailer) has been up to in the years since Return of the Jedi concluded &#8211;&nbsp;won&#8217;t be answered until December 18, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t engage in a little wild speculation.</p>
<p>So click through the gallery above for our takes on the big questions, such as: What happens when a stormtrooper&nbsp;goes AWOL, and how many freakin&#8217; villains are gonna be in this thing?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>&ldquo;Chewie, we&rsquo;re home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fans of the highly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens, or Episode VII, were treated today to a brand new teaser for the upcoming film.</p>
<p>This marks the first new footage to be shown since the <a href="/2014/11/star-wars-the-force-awakens-trailer-released/">first Star Wars teaser</a> was released in November, and it was very much worth the wait:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/star-wars-the-force-awakens-official-teaser-number-2"></a></figure>
<p>Fans are given a closer look at the fresh cast of <em>Star Wars</em> characters including Oscar Isaac&#8217;s Poe Dameron, John Boyega&#8217;s Finn, and Daisy Ridley&#8217;s Rey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to getting a better look at these newcomers, we get some tantalizing shots of Darth Vader&#8217;s helmet, the Millennium Falcon, and familiar faces.</p>
<p>People, we have our first clip of Han Solo and Chewie&nbsp;back in action!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Force Awakens teaser was unveiled during the opening of Star Wars Celebration Live, a four day convention at the Anaheim Convention Center.</p>
<p>According to Deadline, the teaser was revealed by director J.J. Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy during a panel discussion with Isaac, Ridley, and Boyega.</p>
<p>This allowed for the plot to become a little less vague. Isaac described his character as an X-Wing fighter pilot&nbsp;&quot;sent on a mission by a certain princess.&quot;</p>
<p>His character then meets Boyega, who&#8217;s a stormtrooper.</p>
<p>&quot;Their fates are forever intertwined,&quot; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been almost four years since <a href="/2011/07/amy-winehouse-dead-found-in-london-home/">Amy Winehouse died</a> from alcohol poisoning, and of all the stars who tragically joined the &quot;27 club,&quot; few make us wonder what might have been quite like Amy.</p>
<p>The singer had become an international sensation with Back to Black just a few years prior to her death, and many expected her to mature into one of the great singer/songwriters of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="/2011/07/drugs-to-blame-for-amy-winehouse-death/">Amy&#8217;s struggles with drugs and drinking</a> prevented her from ever recording a follow-up, and in July of 2011, she was found dead in her London home.</p>
<p>Now, award-winnning director&nbsp;Asif Kapadia&nbsp;is paying tribute to the woman with the unforgettable beehive &#8216;do and one-of-a-kind voice with a documentary that chronicles Winehouse&#8217;s meteoric rise and devastating fall:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/amy-documentary-teaser"></a></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not a girl trying to be a star,&quot; a young Amy tells an interviewer at one point.</p>
<p>Asked how famous she thinks she&#8217;ll become, Winehouse shyly replies, &quot;I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be at all famous. I don&#8217;t think I could handle it. I think I would go mad.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a side of the music legend that few fans ever saw, or even knew existed.</p>
<p>With her myriad tattoos and rebellious image, it was hard &#8211; at the height of her fame &#8211; to imagine Amy as anything other than bold, brash and endlessly self-assured.</p>
<p>As her struggles and tragic demise later reminded us, however, the spotlight never suited Winehouse, and her insecurities would eventually consume her.</p>
<p>Toward the end of her life, Amy became better-known for her tabloid misadventures than for her remarkable talent.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Kapadia&#8217;s film (due for release this summer) will remind the world of the genius that was so often overshadowed by her self-destructive tendencies.</p>
