<p>There&#8217;s a new champion on <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/who-went-home-on-dancing-with-the-stars-tonight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With the Stars</a></em>. And Joey Graziadei knows just how he wants to celebrate his stunning victory!</p>



<p>In case you missed it, Joey and partner Jenna Johnson took home the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy on Tuesday night&#8217;s <em>DWTS</em> finale.</p>



<p>The pair had consistently impressed the judges throughout the season. So it came as no great surprise when they cemented their victory with a triumphant Cha Cha.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joey-graziadei-s-celebration-plan">Joey Graziadei&#8217;s Celebration Plan</h2>



<p>Still, Joey and Jenna were clearly taken aback by their win. And it seems that Joey plans to spend his holiday weekend in a state of inebriated bliss. </p>



<p>“Oh, I got a really nice bottle of Patron and we&#8217;re gonna get a little drunk. I’ll be honest, Jen, it&#8217;s been a little bit,” Joey told <em>People</em> when asked how he plans to celebrate.</p>



<p>But Jenna, it seems, is planning on marking the occasion in a much more subdued fashion.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to take a big nap. I cannot wait to sleep,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/joey-graziadei-jenna-johnson-reveal-different-ways-celebrating-dwts-win-8752610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she told the outlet</a>.</p>

<p>“I am going to do the other. I’m gonna have some fun,” Joey chimed in.</p>



<p>It was a triumphant night for Joey and Jenna, who earned a perfect score on their redemption Cha Cha and a 29 out of 30 on their Freestyle performance.</p>



<p>&#8220;It means everything, this whole experience has been unbelievable,&#8221; Graziadei said after the win. </p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for bearing with us. I tried my best, I promise!&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked about receiving a less-than-perfect score from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/carrie-ann-inaba-dwts-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously finicky judge Carrie Ann Inaba</a>, Jenna gave a philosophical response:</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s part of the competition. You have to be prepared for anything. So it was hard in the moment, but looking back, I appreciate the judge&#8217;s remarks and I&#8217;ll always accept them,&#8221; she told <em>People</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;But yeah, we have this now [the trophy], so all good.&#8221;</p>



<p>As for Joey, the guy just can&#8217;t stop winning this year!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joey-s-big-year">Joey&#8217;s Big Year</h2>



<p>Joey&#8217;s string of victories began back in March, when we saw him get <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/joey-graziadei-bachelor-eliminations-who-got-sent-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engaged to Kelsey Anderson</a> on the season finale of <em>The Bachelor</em>.</p>



<p>Kelsey and Joey are still together, and insiders say the wedding planning process is going swimmingly.</p>

<p>Kelsey has indicated that she and Joey intend to <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-bachelor-signs-joey-graziadei-kelsey-anderson-never-get-married/#:~:text=Kelsey%20went%20on%20to%20say,a%20wedding%20date%20until%202025." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce the date of their nuptials</a> sometime in early 2025.</p>



<p>Obviously, it won&#8217;t be easy for Joey to top the year he&#8217;s just had.</p>



<p>But clearly, the newest <em>Dancing With the Stars</em> champ has a plan in place to do exactly that!</p>

<p>Is Jenn Tran really dating her <em>DWTS </em>partner?</p>



<p><em>Dancing With The Stars</em> churns up dating rumors and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/brooks-nader-boyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hookup scandals</a> from time to time. Sometimes, they&#8217;re even true.</p>



<p>But no one could miss the obvious chemistry between <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/dancing-with-the-stars-stunner-jenn-tran-is-totally-smashing-sasha-farber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenn Tran and Sasha Farber</a>. Then came dating rumors on social media.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-jenn-tran-dating-her-dwts-partner-sasha-farber">Is Jenn Tran dating her &#8216;DWTS&#8217; partner Sasha Farber?</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, November 14 episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jenn-tran-from-bachelorette-to-ballroom/id1514867862?i=1000676939808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sorry We&#8217;re Cyrus</em> podcast</a>, Jenn Tran faced an interrogation about whether she&#8217;s dating <em>DWTS </em>partner Sasha Farber.</p>



<p>As the <em>The Bachelorette</em> alum spoke to Brandi Cyrus and her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/tish-cyrus-stole-dominic-purcell-husband-from-noah-cyrus-family-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial mother</a>, Tish Cyrus, they asked &#8220;what&#8217;s next&#8221; for Jenn and Sasha. &#8220;Just BFFs or is there, like, any dating potential there?&#8221; asked Brandi.</p>



<p>Jenn Tran responded with a tasteful answer about her <em>DWTS </em>partner. &#8220;BFFs for life,&#8221; she replied.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Jenn Tran on October 10, 2024." class="wp-image-513441" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenn Tran attends Us Weekly And Pluto TV&#8217;s: Reality TV Stars Of The Year at The Highlight Room on October 10, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-jenn-tran-says-that-she-can-t-predict-if-she-ll-be-dating-sasha-farber-one-day">But Jenn Tran says that she &#8216;can&#8217;t predict&#8217; if she&#8217;ll be dating Sasha Farber one day</h2>



<p>Obviously, Brandi Cyrus noticed that this wasn&#8217;t necessarily a complete answer.</p>



<p>When she pressed further, the 26-year-old <em>The Bachelorette</em> alum admitted: &#8220;I can&#8217;t predict the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>That line is a bit of a wink and a nod at the audience. After all, it is easy to &#8220;predict&#8221; that you won&#8217;t be dating someone in the future unless you think &#8212; or hope &#8212; that it might happen.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="772" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-1024x772.jpg" alt="Sasha Farber and Jenn Tran on November 9, 2024." class="wp-image-513442" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-1024x772.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-300x226.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-768x579.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-2048x1544.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-960x724.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-1080x814.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_03-1200x905.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sasha Farber and Jenn Tran attend the Los Angeles premiere of Universal Pictures &#8220;Wicked&#8221; at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on November 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tish Cyrus suggested that it would be fun if Jenn Tran went on a DWTS tour with her &#8220;boyfriend.&#8221; That got some pushback.</p>



<p>“If you say boyfriend he’s going to freak out,” Jenn quickly countered.</p>



<p>Of course, when Brandi suggested that they didn&#8217;t need to use the label, Jenn added more to the list: &#8220;Partner, husband, baby daddy.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Jenn Tran could not help but grumble a little about the whispers that she is dating her <em>DWTS </em>partner.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is how rumors start,&#8221; she warned.</p>



<p>Though, to be clear, Jenn herself hinted that the two might be dating. Some believe that she &#8220;soft launched&#8221; a romance on a Halloween <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jenntranx/video/7431677053453225246/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> video following their <em>DWTS </em>elimination. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="729" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-1024x729.jpg" alt="Jenn Tran on July 25, 2024." class="wp-image-513443" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-1024x729.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-300x214.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-768x547.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-2048x1458.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-960x683.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-1080x769.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1118_jenntran_04-1200x854.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenn Tran attends the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine The Bachelorette Special Screening at AMC The Grove 14 theater in Los Angeles, California on July 25, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-the-rumor-really-start">How did the rumor really start?</h2>



<p>“Private rehearsals starting ASAP,” which Jenn Tran wrote on her October 31 TikTok, sounded to some like a euphemism.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s not declaring that they&#8217;re dating. Right now, whatever&#8217;s going on with them, they&#8217;re not prepared to put a &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; label on it.</p>



<p>Still, she and Sasha Farber seem closer than she is with her ex Devin Strader. Post-<em>The Bachelorette </em>breakups no longer come as a surprise to longtime viewers. It would be a little sad if <em>DWTS </em>turned out to be a better matchmaker.</p>

<p>Carrie Ann Inaba&#8217;s <em>DWTS </em>scoring has riled up fans.</p>



<p>Even as this season <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/dancing-with-the-stars-stunner-jenn-tran-is-totally-smashing-sasha-farber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of <em>Dancing With The Stars</em></a> has captivated viewers, one judge has incensed the audience.</p>



<p>And this isn&#8217;t even the first time.</p>



<p>Carrie Ann Inaba is often eager to claim that <em>DWTS </em>critics of her are sexist. But critics say that she&#8217;s the one who throws women under the bus but hands out high scores to men like it&#8217;s Halloween candy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Carrie Ann Inaba at the 2024 Disney Upfronts in May." class="wp-image-512257" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_carrieanninaba_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Ann Inaba attends the 2024 Disney Upfront at Javits Center on May 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dwts-fans-are-fuming-at-carrie-ann-once-again">&#8216;DWTS&#8217; fans are fuming at Carrie Ann (once again)</h2>



<p>On the Tuesday, October 29 episode of <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>, it was Halloween Nightmares Week. Unfortunately, some of the scoring seemed to cause more of a fright than anyone&#8217;s dancefloor looks.</p>



<p>One major concern for viewers came when Carrie Ann Inaba, a choreographer who has featured on <em>DWTS </em>off and on since 2005, evaluated 24-year-old Disney actress Chandler Kinney.</p>



<p>Chandler danced alongside professional dancer Brandon Armstrong. The two performed a Viennese Waltz to &#8220;Secret.&#8221; They impressed many of the <em>DWTS </em>judges &#8230; but not Carrie Ann.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Chandler Kinney’s Halloween Nightmares Viennese Waltz – Dancing with the Stars" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOHye3_b-3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Judges Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough both awared 10s &#8212; out of 10, making that a <em>perfect</em> individual score from them both. Carrie Ann whipped out her DWTS paddle and presented Chandler with a 9.</p>



<p>9 is obviously not a bad score, but it ensured that Chandler didn&#8217;t get three 10s. Which struck many as odd, as Carrie Ann had not seemed so reserved by less impressive dances by some of the men.</p>



<p>&#8220;So it was really strong,&#8221; Carrie Ann admitted on <em>DWTS</em>. &#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t call it perfection just because it&#8217;s such a higher criteria.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/brutalpisces/status/1851435679785390283
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-carrie-ann-really-being-unfair-with-her-dwts-scores">Was Carrie Ann really being unfair with her &#8216;DWTS&#8217; scores?</h2>



<p>Viewers pointed out that it&#8217;s not like Carrie Ann is just really reluctant to give high <em>DWTS </em>scores.</p>



<p>After all, Dwight Howard, Danny Amendola, Joey Grazadei, and Stephen Nedoroscik all received 10s from Carrie Ann during that same episode of <em>Da</em>ncing <em>With The Stars</em>. Which just makes the <em>woman </em>contestant&#8217;s lower score despite her performance seem &#8230; odd.</p>



<p>Though Twitter is in decline, users took to the social media platform to <a href="https://x.com/Golden_Josette/status/1851434547893719115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observe</a>: &#8220;Chandler not getting a perfect score because Carrie Ann loves to underscore women every season.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/luvxrae/status/1851433709951410305
</div></figure>



<p>Another <a href="https://x.com/Wltrxclments/status/1851432699338387942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> reads: &#8220;Them giving all the men good scores when they’re hardly dancing (just doing lifts) is my villain origin story.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;These judges are so harsh on the women but praise the men for doing the bare minimum,&#8221; another <a href="https://x.com/alltoochey/status/1851421972615348656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> denizen lamented. &#8220;I don’t understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>It sounds like many <em>DWTS </em>fans are accusing Carrie Ann of internalized misogyny. When one internalizes an external oppressive system, it can make a person prejudiced against themselves and others like them. It can happen with racism, homophobia, and yes, it can absolutely happen with misogyny.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/ungodlywests/status/1851424769331380547
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-she-have-to-say-for-herself">What does she have to say for herself?</h2>



<p>&#8220;I judge what I see from my perspective,&#8221; Carrie Ann Inoba wrote on her Instagram Story in response to recent backlash. &#8220;If I just did what other people do, I would have zero value as a judge.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;But as the woman on the panel, I&#8217;m constantly made a target of blame and vitriol.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is precisely how viewers believes that she is treating the women who are dancers. Is it possible that they&#8217;re <em>both </em>right? Maybe Carrie Ann is being overly harsh and viewers are being extra critical of her in turn &#8212; all due to the same pernicious societal forces.</p>

<p>She failed to find love the first time around on reality television.</p>



<p>But the second time appears to be the charm for Jenn Tran.</p>

<p>The very recent Bachelorette lead is a contestant on Dancing with the Stars Season 33 &#8230; and she&#8217;s been burning up more than just the dance floor with partner Sasha Farber.</p>



<p>So some observers believe, at least.</p>



<p>Tran has been sharing a number of videos of her and Sasha practicing their routines on TikTok, which isn&#8217;t all that unusual for participants on this program.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a different video that has caught the attention of many fans, followers and viewers.</p>

<p>One night last week, you see, Sasha shared a</p>



<p>The very next morning <strong>Tran was wearing the same clothes</strong> in a social media post she shared online, with folks connecting what appeared to be some obvious dots here.</p>



<p>She clearly spent the night with Farber, right?</p>



<p>And the two may have had sexual intercourse.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="501" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/jenn-Bachelorette-finale-090324-e3436ace831b4f18a1bdbc7adff16f65.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-508429" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/jenn-Bachelorette-finale-090324-e3436ace831b4f18a1bdbc7adff16f65.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/jenn-Bachelorette-finale-090324-e3436ace831b4f18a1bdbc7adff16f65-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenn Tran on the finale of her Bachelorette season.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s for sure something really genuine and special brewing between Jenn and Sasha,” a source previously told The Sun. </p>



<p>“They have become the new [Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko] on the DWTS set in the sense that they&#8217;re the new showmance, the new ‘it couple’ everyone is looking at.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tran, of course, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/the-bachelorette-finale-jenn-tran-gets-engaged-and-then-gets-heart-shattered-into-a-million-pieces/">proposed to Devin Strader</a> on The Bachelorette finale in September.</p>



<p>The two seemed to be soulmates and naive fans thought they would spend the rest of their lives together.</p>

<p>On the After the Final Rose ceremony, though, Tran explained that things became &#8220;different,&#8221; adding of Devin: </p>



<p>&#8220;It kind of felt like he was pulling away, all the promises he had made to me of wanting to move somewhere together and have this future planned out.”</p>



<p>She continued on air:</p>



<p>“He had basically said that he didn’t love me anymore and didn’t feel the same way and felt like something had been off. He regretted getting engaged and I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>For his part, Strader has basically confirmed Tran&#8217;s telling of how things transpired.</p>



<p>On September 10, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/devin-strader-issues-lengthy-statement-breaks-silence-on-the-bachelorette-drama/">Strader released a 13-minute video</a> on Instagram during which he acknowledged that “there are plenty of people upset with me right now.”</p>



<p>“I really, really am sorry for the way things played out. My intentions were to never hurt you, and I’m sorry for that hurt that I’ve caused,” Strader said at the time.</p>



<p>“I realized I made a mistake and I am sorry. Reflecting back, I didn’t realize that I did make a poor decision and I shouldn’t be playing with people’s feelings especially when it’s regarding their emotions.”</p>

<p>Who went home on <em>Dancing With The Stars</em> tonight?</p>



<p>The new season of the beloved reality competition show started out with a bang, with many couples snagging a 20+ score on their first twirl out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then things got interesting, with not one but two stars being axed right from the start. </p>



<p>Of course, fans have their favorites now, rallying behind their favorite Olympians, <a data-wpil-monitor-id="478" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/traci-braxton-vh1-reality-star-dies-at-50-from-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reality stars</a>, and even convicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But someone has to go home, and the latest contestant to be eliminated was a surprise, but also weirdly celebrated  as fans were a bit fed up with their &#8220;showmance&#8221;. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177-683x1024.jpg" alt="BROOKS NADER, and GLEB SAVCHENKO on Dancing with the Stars" class="wp-image-511119" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/174295_EM106177.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Brooks NaderÂ andÂ Gleb Savchenko took their final turn about the ballroom on October 15.<span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Disney/Eric McCandless))</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-went-home-on-dancing-with-the-stars-tonight"><strong>Who Went Home on ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Tonight?</strong></h2>



<p>In the end, no amount of chemistry could save  <strong>Brooks Nader</strong> and <strong>Gleb Savchenko</strong> from elimination. </p>



<p>“It’s been amazing and we have so much fun,” the model said following the news of her elimination.</p>



<p>And then, whether jokingly or not, she shared that she might have willed her elimination into existence before her time </p>



<p> “I just said, ‘Imagine if it was us.’ Maybe I manifested it mistakenly,” she added in her exit interview. </p>



<p>Fans have had mixed emotions about the pair from the start. Most bought into the romance angle and enjoyed their time on the floor together. Others &#8211; and enough others, it would appear &#8211; felt like they were &#8220;showing off&#8221; a bit too much. </p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter now, but as far as we hear, the pair aren&#8217;t actually dating. Take from that what you will! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-went-home-last-week"><strong>Who Went Home Last Week?</strong></h2>



<p>It was another double whammy on the dance floor. And this time, the bottom two actually went home. </p>



<p>Reginald VelJohnson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Emma Slater&nbsp;and&nbsp;Eric Roberts&nbsp;and&nbsp;Britt Stewart&nbsp;all performed their last dance on October 8.</p>



<p>“I have never had a better working experience in my entire professional life,” Eric said of working with Britt Stewart.</p>



<p>Meanwhile,Emma Slater gave Carl Winslow &#8211; yes that&#8217;s his name, come at us &#8211; a hug as they left the floor.  “I won because I’ve got a new friend here,” she said before they left. </p>



<p>Before that, it was two ladies who ended up on the chopping block. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/tori-spelling-homeless/">Tori Spelling</a> and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/anna-delvey-dwts-debut/">Anna Delvey</a>, who fans wanted out right away both were kicked to the curb. </p>



<p>Which was probably a good thing. When Julianne Hough asked Anna what she would miss about the experience, her answer said it all:</p>



<p>“Nothing,” Anna responded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, Anna does not have time for this. Anna does not have time for you.</p>



<p>We do feel bad for Tori though. It would’ve been a good boost for a comeback.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-top-scores-from-last-week"><strong>The Top Scores From Last Week</strong></h2>



<p>The dancers brought a lot of soul to this week’s first performance. On Monday, the gang took to the floor for soul train night and things stayed pretty status quo.</p>



<p>Chandler Kinney and her partner Brandon Armstrong remained at the head of the pack, finishing in first with a set of 3 9’s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jenn Tran and Sasha Farber&nbsp;made a surprising jump up to second place, earning a 35 for their ode to &#8220;Fallin'&#8221;.&nbsp;And&nbsp;Joey Graziadei and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/jojo-siwa-and-jenna-johnson-make-history-grade-their-dancing-wit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Johnson</a> backflipped into third place.</p>



<p>So, right now, it’s a Bachelor Nation’s contestant to lose!</p>



<p>What was also surprising was the continued improvement of Reginald VelJohnson and Emma Slater, who actually brought Carrie Ann to tears with their foxtrot. But it was them who ended up crying as their scores did not spark the same joy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in dead last, yet again, was Eric Roberts and his partner Britt Stewart. He just couldn’t see to get his footing, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-are-the-scores-calculated"><strong>How Are The Scores Calculated</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s how the scoring works. The winners and losers are determined based on their combined scores from the judges and audience votes. So, whatever score Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Derek give the contestants counts for only 50% of their total score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other 50% is calculated from audience votes. Fans can vote to save their favorite couple either online or by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/erika-jayne-exposes-husbands-text-messages-calls-out-alleged-mis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="479">text message</a>. Whomever has the lowest combined score is eliminated.</p>



<p>Now there used to be an element of the show called the “Judges’ Save”. executive producer Deena Katz told <a href="https://tvline.com/news/dancing-with-the-stars-judges-save-eliminated-rule-change-explained-1235168027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TVLine </a>that the judges’ save — which had been in place since Season 28 — was, at least in the eyes of <em>Dancing</em>‘s creative team, diminishing the impact of viewers’ votes.</p>



<p>“I think it should be about America,” Katz said. “And at the end of the day, the judges’ save sometimes isn’t what America wanted. And [eliminations are based on] half the judges and half America voting, and so that’s kind of the reason we did it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-will-win-dancing-with-the-stars-this-season"><strong>Who Will Win ‘Dancing With The Stars’ This Season?</strong></h2>



<p>After 33 seasons, it might seem like it would be easy to spot the winner amongst the losers from the first dance.</p>



<p>But historically speaking, the star who scores the highest on their first dance rarely wins the whole thing in the end.&nbsp; Last season, Xochitl Gomez and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/10/olivia-jade-wtf-losers-im-not-hooking-up-with-val-chmerkovskiy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="482">Val Chmerkovskiy-</a> tied for 5th Place after their first dance. And, Kaitlyn Bristowe and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/nikki-bella-and-artem-chigvintsev-yup-were-married/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="480">Artem Chigvintsev</a> came in 3rd Place after their first routine two years before that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All walked away with the Mirrorball Trophy after all was said and done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So who will win this year? We’re going to guess a top 3 of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/the-bachelorette-finale-jenn-tran-gets-engaged-and-then-gets-heart-shattered-into-a-million-pieces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="483">Jenn Tran</a>, Stephen Nedoroscik, and Chandler Kinney.</p>



<p>But we leave space for us to change our mind as the season progresses!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps it would surprise no one to know that convicted con artist <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/anna-delvey-dancing-with-the-stars-preyed-on-me-exploited-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anna Delvey</a> made zero friends while appearing on Dancing With The Stars. </p>



<p>Less surprising? She’s milking her 15 minutes of renewed fame despite being kicked off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Case in point: a week after she was eliminated from the competition, Anna took a swipe at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/tori-spelling-gushes-with-gratitude-despite-challenging-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="550">Tori Spelling</a>, who also was kicked off the show after just the first week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why take aim at Tori of all people? And why is Tori going along with it?! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anna-delvey-disses-tori-spelling-to-her-face-your-name-sounds-poor"><strong>Anna Delvey Disses Tori Spelling To Her Face: Your Name ‘Sounds Poor’</strong></h2>



<p>“Tori, I’ve heard you wanted to reinvent yourself,” Anna says to Tori in a video shared via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAjTIjzSmR6/">Instagram</a> on Monday, September 30.</p>



<p>Never one to miss an opportunity herself, Tori as quick to invite Anna onto her podcast “MisSpelling” after they got the boot from DWTS.</p>



<p>To promote the episode, the women record a skit titled “Reinventing Tori,” an homage to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/selling-sunset-canceled-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="551">Netflix</a> series based on Delvey’s life.</p>



<p>In the video, Tori looks anxiously over at Anna, eager for any advice on how she could improve her image for this next stage of her career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes! Anna, what can I do?” Spelling asks enthusiastically.</p>



<p>Anna then tells her it might be time to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/raquel-leviss-leaves-rehab-changes-name-is-headed-back-to-vanderpump-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="547">change her name</a>. “Spelling?” the <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/10/tori-spelling-im-finally-joining-the-real-housewives-of-beverly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="548">Beverly Hills</a>, 90210</em> alum questions to which Anna replies, “No. Tori.”</p>



<p>When Tori questions why, Anna brutally replies, “It sounds poor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-joke-hitting-too-close-to-home-for-tori">A Joke Hitting Too Close To Home For Tori </h2>



<p>While this all seems to be in good fun, the joke leaves Tori taken aback. This is seemingly on purpose, though there’s no denying that Tori’s finances have been a topic of much conversation over the past two years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is, Tori’s net worth is actually in question after her divorce from Dean McDermott. She hasn’t worked much and since being forced out of her home after a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/tori-spelling-and-kids-living-out-of-a-motel-after-mold-infestation-divorce-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="552">mold infestation</a>, she’s been bouncing from RVs to rentals to hotels for the better part of a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For all intents and purposes, she’s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/tori-spelling-homeless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homeless</a>! But still, Tori’s not above poking fun at herself, especially if it helps pay the bills. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095-683x1024.jpg" alt=" Anna Delvey  on the red carpet after her arrest" class="wp-image-510385" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171605095.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Anna Delvey poses before a Digital Features: Tackling Issues Of Free Speech And Censorship panel discussion at NeueHouse Madison Square on September 12, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tori-and-anna-talk-their-double-elimination">Tori and Anna Talk Their Double Elimination</h2>



<p>Back to the skit, when Tori inquires about what other changes she can make to reinvent herself, Anna has a simple one word answer: “Nothing.”</p>



<p>For those who haven’t been tuning into <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-went-home-on-dancing-with-the-stars-tonight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a></em> this season, her response is a node to her now-viral interaction with <em>DWTS</em> cohost <a data-wpil-monitor-id="549" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/julianne-hough-to-serve-as-dancing-with-the-stars-co-host-for-season-32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julianne Hough</a> following her elimination from the competition when she claimed she would take “nothing” from the show.</p>



<p>It’s clear that neither personality wanted to be out of the show so quickly and the pair discussed their short-lived journey on the competition series.</p>



<p>For Anna, her goal on the show &#8211; aside from being in front of the cameras &#8211; was to nail the routines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think my focus was ‘Oh, it’s a dancing competition so it’s, like, I have to perform like the steps because that’s how I’ve been trained,’” Anna shared with Tori. She then added that she was classically trained in ballet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have to do the steps, nobody wants to see you smile … [and] in ballet, you don’t smile.”</p>



<p>Well, you had that part down solid, Anna!</p>

<p>Anna Delvey is holding nothing back in the of her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-went-home-on-dancing-with-the-stars-tonight/">elimination from Dancing with the Stars</a>.</p>



<p>After getting the boot from this competition early last week, Delvey actually told NBC News that she believes she was treated unfairly by executives and producers.</p>

<p>“I feel that the show so obviously used me to drive up the ratings, that they never had any plans to give me any chance to grow and only cared about exploiting me for attention,” the convicted felon told this outlet last Friday.</p>



<p>This, of course, is especially rich coming from Anna Delvey.</p>



<p>As we just cited, she is a convicted felon who is currently under house arrest.</p>



<p>Delvey was convicted in 2019 by a New York state court of three counts of grand larceny, one count of attempted grand larceny and four counts of theft of services, among other crimes, after she defrauded a number of individuals and businesses by pretending to be a German heiress.</p>



<p>Delvey served two years in prison and was released on parole in February 2021.</p>



<p>Her casting generated a great deal of controversy for Dancing with the Stars.</p>

<p>As for using someone to drive up ratings?</p>



<p>Yes. That is literally the only reason this program selects <em>any</em> cast members; they choose people they think the public will want to watch and&#8230; we mean, come on. Do we really need to explain how television works?</p>



<p>Apparently so &#8212; to Delvey at least.</p>



<p>“It was predatory of them to try [to] make me feel inadequate and stupid all while I did get progressively better yet they chose to disregard that,&#8221; she added to NBC.</p>

<p>Several days ago, Delvey &#8212; who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/anna-delvey-ankle-monitor-dancing-with-the-stars/">has to wear an ankle monitor</a> &#8212; was eliminated after performing a quickstep routine with her partner, Ezra Sosa, to KT Tunstall’s “Suddenly I See.”</p>



<p>“It felt like I was never really given a fair chance by the viewers or some of the judges’ given their nonsensical scoring,” the 33-year old further told NBC News.</p>



<p>“It’s supposed to be a dance competition and not a popularity contest.”</p>



<p>Excuse us for a moment while we laugh uproariously over the idea that Dancing with the Stars is not a popularity contest.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, Delvey told Good Morning America that her favorite part of the experience was “getting eliminated.”</p>



<p>Viewers likely feel the same.</p>



<p>“I’m trying to start a new chapter moving past mistakes I made and regret when I was much younger,” Delvey told NBC News.</p>



<p>“Not sure when people will finally afford me that second chance and stop persecuting me so I have the opportunity to move on with my life.”</p>

<p>Who is Brooks Nader&#8217;s boyfriend?! </p>



<p>With all the rumors flying around, it&#8217;s hard to nail down who the sensational model is actually linked to these days. </p>



<p>Word on the street is she has amazing &#8220;chemistry&#8221; with her <em>Dancing With The Star</em>s partner.  There have even been reports of backstage smooching going on! </p>



<p>However, this all comes after some cozy sightings with a certain divorced ex-Quarterback that has a thing for brunette models. </p>



<p>Lest us not forget that she&#8217;s also been linked to royalty &#8211; a real life European prince!</p>



<p>So, what&#8217;s rumor and what&#8217;s truth? Who is Brooks Nader&#8217;s boyfriend right now? Let&#8217;s dive in. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="731" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3-731x1024.jpg" alt="âDancing with the Starsâ stars Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko." class="wp-image-509512" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3-731x1024.jpg 731w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3-686x960.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3-771x1080.jpg 771w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/174213_2882_v3.jpg 857w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; stars Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Disney/Andrew Eccles)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-brooks-nader">Who Is Brooks Nader?</h2>



<p>For those of you meeting her through DWTS for the first time, Brooks is a model best known for posing for the&nbsp;<em>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue</em>. </p>



<p>She landed the coveted gig after winning the 2019 Swim Search competition. She&#8217;s been featured in the magazine in 2020, 2021 and 2022, before becoming a covergirl in 2023. </p>



<p>Dancing With The Stars is her first turn on television, but she has acted before in film, most recently in 2018 action crime film&nbsp;<em>Backtrace</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brooks-has-been-married-before">Brooks Has Been Married Before </h2>



<p>Brooks married her longtime advertiser boyfriend&nbsp;Billy Haire&nbsp;during a ceremony in New Orleans in December 2019. “I’m mostly excited to call him hubby!” she told&nbsp;<a href="https://people.com/si-swimsuit-model-brooks-nader-and-husband-billy-haire-announce-divorce-8643218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>People</em></a>&nbsp;ahead of their wedding weekend at the time.</p>



<p> “We are also excited to just continue our adventures together. We’ve done a lot of fun traveling and look forward to doing even more.”</p>



<p>However, their adventures came to an end just shy of five years of marriage. They confirmed they were “divorcing after living apart for months” in May 2024. A rep for the model told&nbsp;<em>People</em>&nbsp;that the split was “amicable.”</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where things get interesting!</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1393899832-683x1024.jpg" alt="Brooks Nader and ex husband Billy Haire before their divorce.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tom-brady-s-new-girlfriend-unlikely">Tom Brady&#8217;s New Girlfriend? Unlikely</h2>



<p>First, Brooks was linked to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/tom-brady-new-girlfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Brady</a> following his divorce from Giselle. She fit the profile: Tom has a thing for models, having also been linked to Irina Shayk on and off since his marriage ended.</p>



<p>Shortly after Brooks&#8217; own divorce, gossip site&nbsp;<em>Deuxmoi</em>&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/3520200/we-can-add-si-swimsuits-brooks-nader-to-the-growing-list-of-supermodels-linked-to-tom-brady" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barstool Sports</a></em>) reported Tom had been spotted in public with the model multiple times.</p>



<p>The exclusive sources that spoke to Deuxmoi said that the two spent time together in the Hamptons at Michael Rubin’s annual Fourth of July white party. We could confirm<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/05/sports/livvy-dunne-si-swimsuit-models-stun-at-michael-rubins-white-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;they both attended</a>, but to say they were there together? Eh…</p>



<p>With no photos to prove it, we think this one might just be wishful thinking &#8211; especially given some of the other reports!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brooks-nader-dating-her-dwts-partner-gleb-savchenko">Brooks Nader Dating Her &#8216;DWTS&#8217; Partner Gleb Savchenko?!</h2>



<p>Brooks and her <em>Dancing with the Stars</em> pro partner <a data-wpil-monitor-id="459" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/11/gleb-savchenko-and-chrishell-stause-did-they-have-an-affair-or-n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleb Savchenko</a> first sparked romance rumors by, what else, posting a photo on social media .</p>



<p>The supermodel shared a photo of herself sitting on Gleb&#8217;s lap on Instagram. Both the model and the 41-year-old professional dancer rested their hands on each other&#8217;s thighs for the snap.</p>



<p>Right away, everyone was sure this was a message to fans to expect a budding romance from these two. However, a few days before the premiere episode, Gleb jumped online to clear up a few things. </p>



<p>The professional dancer exclusively told <em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/09/13/entertainment/dwts-pro-gleb-savchenko-responds-to-brooks-nader-dating-rumors-after-flirty-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> </em>that although his new partner is “great” and that they have “amazing” chemistry in the ballroom, there is no romantic between them.</p>



<p>In fact, given that Gleb is single for the first time in three years after breaking up with his former girlfriend Elena Belle back in March, he told the outlet he’s not focused on dating anyone right now and &#8220;wants to be single for the time being.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then, right after the first elimination episode, PEOPLE reported some wild PDA between the two.  They apparently &#8220;couldn&#8217;t keep their hands off each other&#8221;, and were even actually caught sneaking kisses while practicing. </p>



<p>So, where does that leave Brooks really? Well, if you believe we you can actually see, in the arms of a Prince, as it turns out. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meet-prince-constantine-alexios">Meet Prince Constantine Alexios </h2>



<p>Around the time rumors were circulating that the model was hooking up with Tom, Brooks attended the wedding of fellow model Olivia Culpo.</p>



<p>And she wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>



<p>Brooks arrived on the arm of Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark at&nbsp;Olivia and Christian McCaffrey’s wedding&nbsp;in Rhode Island in July. </p>



<p>Photos that circulated from the nuptials showed the royal with his arm wrapped around Brooks waist, as well as the pair arriving hand and hand together. </p>



<p>And this was all after paparazzi caught them before the wedding making out on a balcony! </p>



<p>To be fair, there haven&#8217;t been any photos of the pair together since, on social media or otherwise, but after hard launching at one of the most anticipated weddings of the year, we couldn&#8217;t be surprised that the pair felt like some privacy. </p>



<p>So, the best guess right now is that Brooks is still dating Prince Constantine. Wonder if he&#8217;ll show up at <em>Dancing With The Stars</em>?! </p>

<p>Concerns about Eric Roberts&#8217; health are circulating on social media following the actor&#8217;s debut on <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/anna-delvey-ankle-monitor-dancing-with-the-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With the Stars</a></em> Tuesday night.</p>



<p>Eric has been in the spotlight for over 40 years, but until recently, he had remained quiet about the details of his personal life.</p>



<p>But in his new memoir, <em>Runaway Train</em>, Eric opens up like never before about his personal demons and his long road to recovery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eric-roberts-painful-past">Eric Roberts&#8217; Painful Past</h2>



<p>In the book, Eric goes into detail about his difficult childhood and his complex relationship with sister <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/julia-roberts-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia Roberts</a>.</p>



<p>It couldn&#8217;t have been easy to share so much about the darkest times in his life, and Eric is being widely praised for his candor.</p>



<p>According to excerpts published by <em><a href="https://people.com/eric-roberts-runaway-train-memoir-8713196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>, Eric describes his father as an abusive alcoholic who “was a very screwed-up individual and not safe for me, or anyone, to have as a father.”</p>

<p>At  17, Eric moved to New York to pursue acting.</p>



<p>He found success almost immediately with roles in <em>King of the Gypsies</em>, <em>Star 80</em>, and <em>Pope of Greenwich Village</em>, in which he costarred with Mickey Rourke.</p>



<p>In 1985, Roberts received an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/who-will-host-the-oscars-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oscar</a> nomination for his role as an escaped convict in a film titled <em>Runaway Train</em>.</p>

<p>Eric would go on to rack up an astonishing 700 film and television credits. In 2017 alone, he worked on 74 different movies.</p>



<p>But he experienced many ups and downs during the height of his fame.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eric-roberts-health-struggles-come-to-light">Eric Roberts&#8217; Health Struggles Come to Light</h2>



<p>A 2018 <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/eric-roberts-the-hardest-working-man-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a></em> profile revealed that Eric suffered a near-fatal motorcycle accident while high on cocaine in 1981.</p>



<p>The crash left him with a traumatic brain injury that completely upended his life.</p>

<p>“I was in a coma. My speech was very retarded. I had to learn how to walk again and talk again. It was really hard,&#8221; Eric told the outlet.</p>



<p>Eric eventually regained his speech and mobility, but his struggles with substance abuse continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eric-s-battle-with-addiction">Eric&#8217;s Battle With Addiction</h2>



<p>According to his wife, Eliza Roberts, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/eric-roberts-latest-to-check-into-celebrity-rehab/1899560/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric has been sober since 1995</a>.</p>



<p> but he says he still feels the consequences of his decades-long addictions to cocaine and alcohol.</p>

<p>In 1992, Eric lost custody of daughter <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/07/emma-roberts-arrested-for-domestic-violence-after-fight-with-eva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emma Roberts</a> due to his substance abuse.</p>



<p>“Of course, the biggest consequence of my drug use was losing Emma,” he writes in the book.</p>



<p> Eric says he also regrets comments that he made while under the influence, such as the multiple times he remarked,  “If it wasn’t for me, there would be no Julia Roberts.”</p>



<p>“I hope Julia will accept this public apology. It was an asinine thing to have said,&#8221; he writes in his book.</p>



<p>We hope, for the sake of all involved, that Eric will be able to find the peace and redemption he seeks.</p>

<p>Anna Delvey made her <em>DWTS </em>debut, with her ankle monitor on full display. But did she do enough to be saved from the first elimination?</p>



<p>When we first reported on this season&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dancing-with-the-stars-season-33-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dancing With The Stars</em> cast</a>, Anna Delvey&#8217;s name jumped out. Not just to us, but to the fandom at large. And there was an immediate divide. </p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t help matters that the infamous fraudster <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/anna-delvey-ankle-monitor-dancing-with-the-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must wear an ankle monitor</a> as she participates in the dance competition. Then, in her debut on the ballroom floor, she even went so far to bedazzle it. </p>



<p>After the show, there was an outcry for Anna to be voted off ASAP, with some suggesting she truly &#8220;deserves to go home first.&#8221; Let&#8217;s discuss. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anna-delvey-takes-her-first-steps-on-the-dwts-floor">Anna Delvey Takes Her First Steps On The &#8216;DWTS&#8217; Floor </h2>



<p><em>Dancing With The Stars </em>Season 33 premiered on Tuesday, September 17.</p>



<p>Anna Delvey and her dance partner, Ezra Sosa, stepped out onto the ballroom floor. They had an array of mock-up high end fashion bags bearing her (fake) initials).</p>



<p>The bags weren&#8217;t merely there for characterization. These props also served as cover for a big reveal.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-1024x576.png" alt="A close-up of Anna Delvey's ankle monitor, somewhat bedazzled, on Dancing With The Stars Season 33." class="wp-image-509546" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">For her DWTS introduction, Anna Delvey didn&#8217;t try to hide her ankle monitor.

<p>One of the conditions of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/anna-delvey-released-from-jail-but-banned-from-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anna Delvey&#8217;s release</a> was that she wear an ankle monitor. And, obviously, she had to receive permission from authorities &#8212; in this case, ICE &#8212; to participate in <em>DWTS</em>.</p>



<p>As soon as the bag was out of the way, the camera put her ankle monitor on full display.</p>



<p>Anna Delvey&#8217;s monitor had a bit of a glow-up. It&#8217;s covered in pink and blue rhinestones, matching her outfit.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-was-anna-delvey-s-first-dwts-dance-and-song">What was Anna Delvey&#8217;s first &#8216;DWTS&#8217; dance and song?</h2>



<p>For her first performance on the <em>DWTS </em>ballroom floor, Anna Delvey and Ezra Sosa performed a Cha Cha to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-meaning-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;Espresso.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>&#8220;Espresso&#8221; was one of 2024&#8217;s most popular songs. It might have been Song of the Summer were it not for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-is-chappell-roan-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another music superstar</a>&#8216;s hit.</p>



<p>The song doesn&#8217;t necessarily go to the heart of Anna Delvey&#8217;s fame. But, then again, how many songs are there about fraud? And how many of those songs work with a Cha Cha?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-1024x576.png" alt="Anna Delvey and Ezra Sosa on Dancing With The Stars Season 33, the season premiere." class="wp-image-509547" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_dwts_annadelvey_04.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">After an impressive first dance, Anna Delvey enjoys applause.

<p>Her performance was, for the judges, a pleasant surprise. Anna Delvey is not a practiced dancer, but she has the makings of one.</p>



<p>The judges hope that she will work on her technique. </p>



<p>For now, she and Ezra scored an 18 out of 30. That is not bad for the season premiere &#8211; but it also might not enough to save her. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anna-s-first-performance-slammed-by-fans">Anna&#8217;s First Performance Slammed By Fans</h2>



<p>While the judges saw promise, fans saw contempt and a lack of enthusiasm from Anna. Many vowed to give their vote elsewhere, despite her technical skills on the floor. </p>



<p>Interestingly, it wasn&#8217;t so much her dancing or even her notoriety that seemed to irk viewers. Heck, it wasn&#8217;t even the ankle bracelet!</p>



<p>No, fans want her out because of her post-dance interview with the judges &#8211; where she pretty much said she didn&#8217;t want to dance anymore!</p>



<p>&#8220;She does not want to be there,&#8221; posted one fan on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dancingwiththestars/comments/1fjhti8/anna_delvey_deserves_to_go_home_first/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>. &#8220;She is not enthusiastic, her dancing was terrible, she’s a criminal, destroyed peoples lives and thinks she has done nothing wrong. The worst part was her saying shes glad she doesn’t have to do that dance again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was shocked when she said she didn’t want to do that dance again,&#8221; added another commenter. &#8220;So many people would love to be on the show and enjoy it and she said that. I feel so sorry for Ezra!&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, there seemed to be an agreement in the subreddit, titled &#8220;Anna Delvey deserves to go home first,&#8221; that few would be voting for her to continue. </p>

<p>Despite her comments and the fan feedback,  Anna Delvey shared how much work had gone into that first dance on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DABm57qvN-v/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>Many viewers are not fully aware of just how grueling a dance competition can be. It&#8217;s a full body workout. And even <em>non-ballet</em> dances can annihilate your feet.</p>



<p>So maybe the Cha-Cha just wasn&#8217;t her thing! Maybe she&#8217;s ready to graduate to something a bit more graceful, less impactful. </p>



<p>Yes, Anna Delvey (real name Anna Sorokin, but that&#8217;s not her <em>DWTS </em>name) is controversial. But that&#8217;s exactly why the show cast her. It will be interesting to see how she does &#8230; and whether her time on the ballroom floor gives her a chance to win over any critics.</p>
