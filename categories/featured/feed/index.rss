<p>News of her passing comes to us courtesy of an unidentified family member, who announced Lucy&#8217;s death on her Instagram page:</p>



<p>&#8220;She was at peace. Me, her mother and my mother were present with her. We ask you please give us space in these hard times,&#8221; the statement read, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/04/11/lucy-markovic-dead-australia-next-top-model-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lucy-markovic-s-cause-of-death-revealed">Lucy Markovic&#8217;s cause of death revealed</h2>



<p>Markovic&#8217;s agency, Elite Model Management, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIRsInvveRP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=97a98708-7c55-4079-a2ad-27e313b9756a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a statement</a> in which they confirmed that she passed away as a result of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM).</p>



<p>The condition is defined as &#8220;a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins in the brain.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-490008450-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lucy Markovic poses backstage ahead of the Australian Luxe show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Festival Sydney 2015 at Sydney Town Hall on September 25, 2015 in Sydney, Australia.

<p>&#8220;Lucy was a bright shining light, and had an incredible dry sense of humor. Her smile and laughter could light up a room, and draw you closer to her. She loved to dance, she really shined,&#8221; reads the statement from Elite Modeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Modeling was one of Lucy’s dreams, and we are deeply honored to have been part of that journey with her. She brought elegance, strength, and beauty to her work. But more than that, she brought herself—her warmth, her laughter, her light,&#8221; the statement continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;To her family and friends, please know that you are in our prayers and in our hearts. We mourn with you, and we celebrate the incredible person Lucy was. We will never forget her.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lucy Markovic poses backstage ahead of the BONDI BORN show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Resort 20 Collections at Totti's Bondi on May 14, 2019 in Sydney, Australia." class="wp-image-523243" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1149023891-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lucy Markovic poses backstage ahead of the BONDI BORN show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Resort 20 Collections at Totti&#8217;s Bondi on May 14, 2019 in Sydney, Australia.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lucy was still in her teens when she wowed <em>Australia&#8217;s Next Top Model</em> judges in 2015.</p>



<p>Though she did not claim the season&#8217;s top prize, she went on to a wildly successful modeling career, walking the runway for brands like Versace and Victoria Beckham.</p>



<p>According to TMZ, in a since-deleted social media post, Lucy revealed that she would be undergoing surgery after doctors found a malformation “the size of a golf ball” in her brain. She had also been experiencing seizures.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to Lucy&#8217;s loved ones during this enormously difficult time.</p>



<p>Though her life was tragically cut short, there&#8217;s some solace in knowing that she was able to live out her dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been diagnosed with ALS,” <a href="https://people.com/eric-dane-diagnosed-with-als-exclusive-11713179">Dane told the outlet</a> late on April 10. “I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter.”</p>



<p>He added:</p>



<p>“I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to set of Euphoria next week. I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.”</p>



<p>The 52-year old is is married to Rebecca Gayheart and the spouses share two children: Billie Beatrice, 15, and Georgia Geraldine, 13.</p>

<p>Dane starred in 139 episodes of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy as Dr. Mark Sloan.</p>



<p>His other major credits include Euphoria, The Last Ship and last year&#8217;s big screen hit, Bad Boys: Ride or Die.</p>



<p>On the beloved HBO drama, Dane plays Cal Jacobs, the strict father to Jacob Elordi’s character Nate Jacobs. He will begin shooting his role for the long-developing third season on April 14.</p>



<p>ALS stands for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It also known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease because the Hall of Fame New York Yankees first baseman passed away from it in 1941.</p>



<p>The prognosis for someone with this rare degenerative disease &#8212; which causes progressive paralysis of the muscles &#8212; is not typically positive.</p>

<p>Those with ALC first experience twitching or weakness in a limb, often followed by slurred speech. </p>



<p>According to the Mayo Clinic, because the disease affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, patients slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk, and breathe independently.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no cure for the disease and the Muscular Dystrophy Association states that patients typically survive only three to five years after diagnosis, although some can live decades.</p>



<p>Sadly, they do not often live in very comfortable circumstances.</p>



<p>In addition to Eric Dane, other notable celebrities who have been diagnosed with ALS include Aaron Lazar, John Driskell Hopkins, Eric Stevens, Joe Bonsall, Roberta Flack, Kenneth Mitchell and Stephen Hawking.</p>



<p><strong>We are sending our thoughts and prayers to Eric Dane and his loved ones.</strong></p>

<p>The movie <em>Marty Supreme</em> won&#8217;t hit theaters until December.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s already receiving very negative reviews from Ms. Kylie Jenner.</p>



<p>The film stars Timothee Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow, the latter of whom has spoken openly about the many graphic sex scenes involving the two leads.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kylie Jenner and actor TimothÃ©e Chalamet look on during the Men's Singles Final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Daniil Medvedev of Russia on Day Fourteen of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2023 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City." class="wp-image-523205" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kylie Jenner and actor TimothÃ©e Chalamet look on during the Men&#8217;s Singles Final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Daniil Medvedev of Russia on Day Fourteen of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2023 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-says-she-and-timothee-do-a-lot-of-banging-in-upcoming-ping-pong-film">Gwyneth says she and Timothee do a lot of banging in upcoming ping pong film</h2>



<p>The film, directed by Josh Safdie, features Timothee as a professional ping pong player who carries on an affair with Gwyneth</p>



<p>“I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie. There’s a lot—a lot,&#8221; Paltrow explained to <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a></em>.</p>



<p>“There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator, which I did not know existed,” she added, noting that when the film&#8217;s intimacy coordinator asked her if she’d be comfortable with a particular move “I was like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on.’ ”</p>



<p>Gwyneth might have laughed the situation off, but it seems that Kylie failed to see the humor.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timothee are in a very serious relationship</a>, and it seems that she&#8217;s not keen on the idea of watching him pretend to bang someone else.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kylie-angry-about-the-reports-of-timmy-s-sex-scenes">Is Kylie angry about the reports of Timmy&#8217;s sex scenes?</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/timothee-chalamet-sex-scenes-ban-jealous-kylie-jenner-gwyneth-paltrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>, Kylie is furious over the film&#8217;s sultry content, and she&#8217;s instructed Timothee not to film any more sex scenes.</p>



<p>“Timothee has no problem being intimate in movies, but Kylie doesn&#8217;t like it. She doesn&#8217;t appreciate all the details and doesn&#8217;t want him to film any more sex scenes moving forward,&#8221; a source tells the outlet.</p>



<p>And apparently, this is no small matter. In fact, the insider claims that it&#8217;s resulted in the worst rough patch of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/is-kylie-jenner-pregnant-timothee-chalamet-would-be-the-likely-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timothee&#8217;s relationship</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been the main source of tension between them lately, and it’s something that has been deeply bothering them,” said the insider.</p>



<p>The source added that Chalamet&#8217;s inner circle is concerned about the ways in which Kylie&#8217;s puritanical rule might limit his career prospects.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wants to explore everything as an actor and artist. It&#8217;s the biggest moment of tension between them since they started dating,&#8221; the insider added.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that Timmy&#8217;s loved ones have expressed misgivings about the relationship.</p>



<p>One insider recently described Kylie and Timothee as &#8220;two complete opposites.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;Many of us don&#8217;t understand how they connect and click.&#8221;</p>



<p>But hey &#8212; as long as Kylie and Timothee understand the attraction, that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>



<p>We just hope she&#8217;ll open up to the idea that pretending to fall for other people is part of Timmy&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>In tirades posted to X (formerly Twitter), West has declared himself a Nazi and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, of being a sex trafficker</a>.</p>



<p>There was a time when it was hard to imagine how Kanye could possibly sink any lower.</p>



<p>But he may have done just that with his latest tantrum.</p>

<p>Kanye went on to fantasize about shocking Taylor by revealing such information.</p>



<p>&#8220;I KNOW TAYLOR LIKE HOW THE F&#8211;K HE KNOW THAT,&#8221; he wrote, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;IM MAD I HAVENT F&#8211;KED TAYLOR SWIFT … YET.&#8221;</p>



<p>The remarks are particularly horrifying when taken as the latest evidence of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/travis-kelces-dad-slams-kanye-west-over-taylor-swift-based-song-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s years-long obsession with Taylor</a>, which was first displayed when he infamously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>

<p>Obviously, the whole situation is disgusting, but Kanye being Kanye, he was just getting warmed up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-makes-nauseating-comments-about-kim">Kanye makes nauseating comments about Kim </h2>



<p>From there, Kanye moved on to one of his favorite topics &#8212; the Kim Kardashian sex tape. Sure, the footage came out back in 2007, and Kim is the mother of Kanye&#8217;s four kids, but that won&#8217;t stop him from being gross about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Told Ray J we need to hit Kim from both sides for that Superstar part two,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/nojumper/status/1910354728489197590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye also admitted to sexually assaulting unsuspecting women while greeting them.</p>



<p>&#8220;I used to do this hug where I press my c-ck against the girls leg and place my hands right where my pinky can touch the top of their a-s like right under the small of their back,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p>As he often does these days, West also praised Hitler repeatedly throughout his tirade. At one point, he tweeted a photo of the infamous dictator along with a goat emoji.</p>



<p>This prompted Kanye&#8217;s long-suffering wife Bianca Censori to speak out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me be clear, Hitler was a genocidal murderer who should never be celebrated. Praising him is a direct insult to the millions who suffered especially the Jewish people,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Bianca_censor/status/1910319029824483500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she wrote</a>, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;@kanyewest antisemitic rhetoric is not only disturbing, it stands against everything I believe in. As long as he keeps repeating this dangerous narrative, I’ll keep speaking out—I want no part in it, &amp; never will.&#8221;</p>



<p>There have been reports that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bianca-censori-stays-with-kanye-west-out-of-fear-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca has separated from Kanye</a> and initiated divorce proceedings, but those remain unconfirmed.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it seems she&#8217;s finally grown tired of his crap.</p>

<p>Teddi Mellencamp shared that her dad, John Mellencamp, already has a plan to lay her to rest.</p>

<p>Her famous father has been anxious to cement her burial plans with her.</p>



<p>The <em>RHOBH </em>alum had to have a heavy conversation &#8212; and she knows that it&#8217;s about more than her and her father.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-john-mellencamp-wants-his-daughter-to-make-plans-for-the-worst">John Mellencamp wants his daughter to make plans for the worst</h2>



<p>During the Tuesday, April 8 episode of her <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-two-ts-in-a-pod-with-tedd-49447273/episode/hot-girls-never-die-headlines-272076661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Two Ts in a Pod</em> podcast</a>, Teddi Mellencamp spoke to co-host Tamra Judge about a serious, important topic.</p>



<p>She revealed that her father, famed musician John Mellencamp, has been calling her repeatedly. </p>



<p>He has been wanting to have an important, albeit morbid in every sense, conversation with her.</p>



<p>“Finally, I answer, I’m like, ‘I’m in the bath. Let me live a little,&#8217;” Teddi described. “He goes, ‘I just want to make sure you’re going to be in our group family mausoleum.&#8217;”</p>

<p>After John Mellencamp broached the topic, Teddi revealed that she wondered about the future.</p>



<p>Would the family mausoleum also have space for her children. </p>



<p>Slate is 12, Cruz is 10, and Dove is 5.</p>



<p>At some point, in the very distant future, she&#8217;d like for their remains to reside near hers.</p>

<p>“He’s like, ‘Well, there’s going to be the top five and then we’re gonna have little areas around it, and then that’s where everyone’s going to get buried,&#8217;” Teddi recalled.</p>



<p>Continuing to describe the talk with her father, she added: “He goes, ‘You’re doing your will right now, so you may as well put it in there.&#8217;”</p>



<p>Teddi shared that she agreed with her father&#8217;s wishes. Additionally, she shared plans to travel to Indiana to visit the site in person.</p>

<script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>



<p>In a moment of levity, Teddi joked that she would like to have the quote, &#8220;Hot girls never die,&#8221; engraved upon her tombstone.</p>



<p>(That quote became the title of that podcast episode)</p>



<p>Teddi presumably does not intend for her ex to be part of the mausoleum. </p>



<p>Though she shares her three children with Edwin Arroyave, the two split just six months ago, in October 2024 &#8212; following 14 years of marriage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-has-been-a-short-hard-journey-for-teddi-mellencamp">This has been a short, hard journey for Teddi Mellencamp</h2>



<p>Teddi received her skin cancer diagnosis in 2022. However, in February, doctors found tumors growing in her brain.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/teddi-mellencamp-reveals-multiple-tumors-on-brain-bravo-star-to-undergo-immediate-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain surgery</a> was able to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/teddi-mellencamp-details-brain-surgery-removal-of-4-tumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remove four tumors</a>, they &#8220;had been growing for at least six months.&#8221; There were others in her brain and lungs.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, Teddi shared that these growths &#8220;are all a direct result of my melanoma.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, she is fighting for her life &#8212; and having difficult conversations with loved ones as she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/teddi-mellencamp-i-know-this-cancer-may-kill-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prepares for the worst</a>.</p>

<p>For several weeks now, we&#8217;ve been reporting on the persistent rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/barack-obama-divorce-chatter-hits-fever-pitch-source-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barack and Michelle are headed for divorce</a>.</p>



<p>While neither party commented on the situation directly, there seemed to be numerous signs that something had changed within the Obamas&#8217; marriage.</p>



<p>For starters, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/barack-obama-attends-la-clippers-game-without-michelle-amid-rampant-divorce-speculation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barack made numerous solo public appearances</a> at a time when he must have already caught wind of the rumors.</p>



<p>Observers figured that he must have known how the public would react, and the move might therefore be his subtle way of confirming that he and Michelle were headed for Splitsville.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Former US First Lady Michelle Obama introduces Former US President Barack Obama on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024.

<p>But during a recent appearance on Sophia Bush&#8217;s podcast, Michelle quashed the divorce rumors.</p>



<p>She pointed out, quite reasonably, that she and Barack are both very busy people, and it makes perfect sense that they would attend events separately from time to time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-embraces-the-power-of-no">Michelle embraces the power of &#8216;no&#8217;</h2>



<p>Speaking with Bush, Michelle revealed that in recent years, she&#8217;s been forced to turn down more invitations. And apparently, she&#8217;s found the experience empowering.</p>

<p>“The interesting thing is that when I say ‘no,’ for the most part, people are like, ‘I get it,’ and I’m OK,” Michelle explained, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/09/celebrity-news/michelle-obama-addresses-barack-divorce-rumors-after-stepping-away-from-the-limelight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“And that’s the thing that we as women struggle with — disappointing people,” she continued. </p>



<p>“So much so that people, they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”</p>



<p>From there, Michelle laughed off the idea that her marriage was coming to an end, dismissing the rumors as the result of small minds and their inability to cope with the fact that she&#8217;s “a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1024x683.jpg" alt="Former US President Barack Obama arrives onstage after his wife and former First Lady Michelle Obama introduced him on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024." class="wp-image-523113" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former US President Barack Obama arrives onstage after his wife and former First Lady Michelle Obama introduced him on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“But that’s what society does to us,” she said. </p>



<p>“We actually finally start going, ‘What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?’ And if it doesn’t fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible.”</p>



<p>Yes, it seems that Michelle merely began pursuing her own interests &#8212; she launched a new podcast with her brother last month &#8212; and because of that, the whole world assumed she was getting divorced.</p>



<p>Her comments probably won&#8217;t put the rumors to bed completely.</p>



<p>But for now, we feel perfectly comfortable declaring that there&#8217;s no reason to believe these two are calling it quirs.</p>

<p>If you watched the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-who-lives-who-dies-what-becomes-of-the-wildly-effed-up-ratliff-clan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 finale of <em>The White Lotus</em></a>, then you know that things came to a head in a big way Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood&#8217;s characters.</p>



<p>If you <em>haven&#8217;t</em> caught the episode yet, 1. <em>What have you been doing with yourself?</em> and 2. Be warned &#8212; spoilers lie ahead!</p>



<p>Every season of <em>Lotus</em> ends with the death of a major character, and Season 3 offered a double-whammy as Goggins&#8217; Rick and Wood&#8217;s Chelsea were both gunned down in heartbreaking fashion.</p>



<p>(Scott Glenn, as Rick&#8217;s shady dad, also bit the dust, but he could hardly be described as a &#8220;major&#8221; character.)</p>

<p>Anyway, between his work as Rick and his role as Uncle Baby Billy on <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, Goggins is finally getting his due as TV&#8217;s top character actor.</p>



<p>But Goggins&#8217; big moment has been somewhat overshadowed by a bit of salacious gossip that&#8217;s gained a surprising amount of traction on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-goggins-and-wood-leave-thailand-on-bad-terms">Did Goggins and Wood leave Thailand on bad terms?</h2>



<p>After the episode aired, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIIPIg5OxGl/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goggins paid loving tribute to Wood</a> with a moving Instagram post about how much their collaboration meant to him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Aimee Lou Wood in a scene from 'The White Lotus' Season 3." class="wp-image-523099" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aimee Lou Wood in a scene from &#8216;The White Lotus&#8217; Season 3.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Max)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But as <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/09/celebrity-news/white-lotus-co-stars-walton-goggins-and-aimee-lou-wood-spark-feud-rumors-after-finale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> points out, eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that the costars are no longer following one another on Instagram.</p>



<p>In fact, it looks as though Goggins may have blocked Wood, as her earlier comments on his posts have all disappeared.</p>



<p>The actors have made mostly positive comments about each other in the press.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aimee-s-cryptic-comments-about-walton">Aimee&#8217;s cryptic comments about Walton</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1024x683.jpg" alt="Walton Goggins stars as Rick on 'The White Lotus.'" class="wp-image-523098" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Walton Goggins stars as Rick on &#8216;The White Lotus.&#8217;<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Max)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But in a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-chelsea-death-aimee-lou-wood-interview-1236183887/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>, Wood noted that Goggins skipped the finale viewing party, and the situation led her to compare the star to his toxic character.</p>



<p>“I was sad that Walton wasn’t there because it was something that we did together but also it’s so f–king Rick and Chelsea,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-chelsea-death-aimee-lou-wood-interview-1236183887/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she told the outlet</a>.</p>



<p>“Like, of course Walton had to watch it alone and of course I had to watch it in the group because there is so much Aimee in Chelsea and so much Walton in Rick.”</p>



<p>Those comments come on the heels of remarks made by Jason Isaacs &#8212; who played embattled patriarch Timothy Ratliff &#8212; who revealed that there was quite a bit of tension on set.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-1024x683.jpg" alt="Aimee Lou Wood and Walton Goggins as Chelsea and Rick on 'The White Lotus.'" class="wp-image-523097" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/aimee-lou-wood-walton-goggins.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aimee Lou Wood and Walton Goggins as Chelsea and Rick on &#8216;The White Lotus.&#8217;<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Max)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;It was like a cross between summer camp and Lord of the Flies but in a gilded cage,&#8221; he told <em><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jason-isaacs-white-lotus-tim-ratliff-breakdown-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a></em>. &#8220;It wasn’t a holiday. Some people got very close, there were friendships that were made and friendships that were lost.&#8221;</p>



<p>Was he referring to bad blood between Goggins and Wood? </p>



<p>Or is there truth to the rumors that Isaacs didn&#8217;t get along with his onscreen wife, Parker Posey?</p>



<p>We may never know for sure. But it sounds like enough tension off-camera to fuel <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-4-location-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an entire season of <em>The White Lotus</em></a>!</p>

<p>Britney Spears has once again dumped Paul Soliz.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s probably for the best.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/britney-spears-nails-frightened-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney&#8217;s recovery</a> has come a long way. But she recently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/britney-spears-paul-soliz-back-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconciled</a> with her controversial ex.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it was over almost as quickly as it began. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-britney-spears-dumped-paul-soliz-again">Britney Spears dumped Paul Soliz again!</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s an &#8220;Oops &#8230; I Did It Again&#8221; joke in here somewhere.</p>



<p><em>TMZ </em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/04/08/britney-spears-paul-soliz-break-up-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that Britney Spears dumped controversial on-again, off-again boyfriend Paul Soliz nearly two months ago.</p>



<p>It was, specifically, around Valentine&#8217;s Day. Harsh time to break up, but is there ever an <em>easy </em>time for a much-needed breakup?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Britney Spears on April 12, 2018." class="wp-image-523035" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Honoree Britney Spears accepts the Vanguard Award onstage at the 29th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on April 12, 2018.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for GLAAD)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Britney and her once-again ex first broke up back in July of 2024. </p>



<p>Many of her fans rejoiced at the time, fearing his intentions &#8212; and the ill effects of their little-understood entanglement.</p>



<p>According to <em>TMZ</em>, the two reconciled in February. </p>



<p>It sounds like this second attempt only lasted weeks &#8212; or less.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="748" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-1024x748.jpg" alt="Britney Spears on October 18, 2018." class="wp-image-523036" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-768x561.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-2048x1497.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-960x702.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-1080x789.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_03-1200x877.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Singer Britney Spears attends the announcement of her new residency, &#8220;Britney: Domination&#8221; at Park MGM on October 18, 2018.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-they-break-up">Why did they break up?</h2>



<p>No one seems to know why Britney ditched him this time.</p>



<p><em>TMZ</em>&#8216;s report does specify that those closest to them believe that, this time, it&#8217;s over for good.</p>



<p>Of course, many people have a habit of repeating the same mistake.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="691" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-1024x691.jpg" alt="Britney Spears on November 4, 2017." class="wp-image-523037" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-300x202.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-768x518.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-2048x1381.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-960x648.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-1080x728.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0409_britneyspears_04-1200x809.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Singer Britney Spears speaks during the grand opening of the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation Britney Spears Campus on November 4, 2017.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the report, Paul Soliz only recently removed the whole of his personal items from Britney&#8217;s Los Angeles mansion.</p>



<p>The two had been living together when they were an item. </p>



<p>As many people know, breaking up sometimes involves undignified steps &#8212; like retrieving your belongings.</p>



<p>Notably, Soliz was already familiar with her home. He had been doing housekeeping duties in her household in 2023, before the two began a relationship.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-split-is-for-the-best">This split is for the best</h2>



<p>Britney Speras and Paul Soliz had an infamously volatile relationship.</p>



<p>Memorably, in May of last year, the two appeared to get into some sort of fight. </p>



<p>This led to some bizarre claims that Britney was going to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/britney-spears-breakdown-debunking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a &#8220;breakdown.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>Imagine if everyone who argued with a partner were treated as if they needed to be hospitalized. Britney sure can&#8217;t catch a break with certain people!</p>

<p>Tragic news from the world of sports today, as former MLB star Octavio Dotel has passed away at the age of 51.</p>



<p>Preliminary reports indicate that Dotel was one of 44 people who were killed when the roof of a nightclub collapsed in the Dominican Republic.</p>



<p>Multiple news outlets initially reported that he had been removed from the rubble still alive.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-octavio-dotel-is-now-believed-to-have-passed-away">Octavio Dotel is now believed to have passed away</h2>



<p>According to a report from <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/08/world-news/at-least-13-dead-when-roof-collapses-at-popular-dominican-republic-nightclub/">The New York Post</a></em>, Dotel, along with eight others, was alive when he was discovered by rescue workers.</p>



<p>Sadly, he later succumbed to his injuries at a nearby hospital.</p>



<p>The retired MLB pitcher, who played for 13 teams over the course of his 15-year career, was one of more than 150 clubgoers who had packed in for a performance by merengue singer Rubby Pérez.</p>



<p>“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” Dotel&#8217;s manager, Enrique Paulino, told reporters.</p>

<p>At press time, police indicated that rescue crews were still sifting through the debris to find additional survivors.</p>



<p>“We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” said a spokesperson.</p>



<p>The cause of the collapse remains unknown, and local officials say they&#8217;re doing everything in their power to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>

<p>“We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” President Luis Abinader wrote on X today, according to the <em>Post</em>.</p>



<p>“We stand in solidarity with the families of the victims, the injured, and all the Dominican people at this difficult time,” Charge d’Affaires Patricia Aguilera wrote on Facebook.</p>



<p>“We appreciate the tireless efforts of the rescue teams,” she added.</p>



<p>Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Monrecristi and sister of baseball legend Nelson Cruz, was also among the deceased.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available,</p>

<p>Back in 2023, the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry&#8217;s debut memoir </a>created quite a stir within royal circles.</p>



<p>The book, titled <em>Spare</em>, contained many surprising revelations about Harry&#8217;s childhood and early adult years.</p>



<p>But it was not as critical of the other members of the royal family as some readers had expected and &#8212; in many cases &#8212; hoped.</p>



<p>Still, it seems that Harry&#8217;s brother and sister-in-law are so offended by the very existence of the book that they refuse to give it a chance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-and-william-reportedly-refuse-to-read-harry-s-book">Kate and William reportedly refuse to read Harry&#8217;s book</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-14522965/Royal-Family-thought-hearing-Prince-Harry-memoir-called-Spare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to</a> a recent biography of King Charles by royal expert Robert Hardman, neither Will nor Kate has read Harry&#8217;s memoir.</p>



<p>And it seems that neither of them has any intention of doing so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither of them read it. He is a grown-up, 40-year-old with the BBC app on his phone so he knows what it says,&#8221; one palace insider remarked. &#8220;But he has people like me to tell him what else he needs to know. We gave him the key points.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the book may not have proved as damaging as some royals feared, it still generated a good deal of controversy at a very vulnerable time for the royals (it hit stores just months after the death of Queen Elizabeth II).</p>



<p>Hardman says the royals cryptically referred to bad press from overseas as &#8220;headwinds that we face from across the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was one way of describing an extraordinary 12-week run of non-stop disobliging headlines and combative allegations, all of them entirely beyond the control of the King and his staff. Storm-force gales might have been a better metaphor,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p>Hardman added that despite the challenges presented by the book&#8217;s publication, the lasting impact was negligible.</p>



<p>&#8220;That this should all be unfolding in the first phase of a new reign might once have been considered disastrous. However, there were two unexpected aspects to these ‘headwinds’ which would work in Charles III’s favour,&#8221; he explained, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;First, the constant diet of extraneous negativity, though awkward and at times embarrassing, made very little impact, according to polls, on public attitudes towards the monarchy. Second, it appeared to have no discernible impact on the King himself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, there are still concerns about Harry&#8217;s literary career, due mainly to the fact that &#8220;large chunks of more recent events&#8221; were left out of Spare.</p>



<p>&#8220;This suggested either a sequel or, perhaps, a memoir by Meghan in due course,&#8221; Hardman wrote.</p>



<p>There has been talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/meghan-markle-tell-all-memoir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan writing a memoir</a> of her own. But considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-hates-america-and-should-self-deport-conservative-group-argues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s book almost got him deported</a>, we&#8217;re guessing he&#8217;s content to focus on other pursuits for a while.</p>
