<p>Andy Cohen has some harsh words for Meghan McCain.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, McCain expressed her support for Payton McNabb&#8230; who has advocated against trans athletes in women&#8217;s sports after the volleyball player claims she suffered a concussion in a 2022 high school game because a trans opponent spiked the ball at her head.</p>



<p>McNabb will actually be a guest of President Donald Trump when he addresses Congress in a speech on Tuesday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="895" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-1024x895.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520665" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-1024x895.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-300x262.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-768x671.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-2048x1790.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-960x839.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-1080x944.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2163476216-1200x1049.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Andy Cohen visits SiriusXM at SiriusXM Studios on July 24, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I have had the pleasure of meeting Payton &#8211; she is incredibly smart, strong and brave. Both she and her family have been through the unthinkable,&#8221; Tweeted the former View panelist, adding of a certain political party: </p>



<p>&#8220;Democrats defending young women suffering from traumatic brain injuries as a result of trans athletes is why they will continue losing every election.&#8221;</p>



<p>Not long after she shared this message, Cohen took to the replies to call out McCain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Surprised you&#8217;re buying into the vilification of the trans community given the real problems happening in this country, your previous ally-ship of the lgbtq community, and the fact that this non issue affects about four people in this country,&#8221; wrote the Bravo producer.</p>

<p>McCain &#8212; who made news recently when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-mccain-i-absolutely-hate-meghan-markle/">she slammed Meghan Markle</a> &#8212; then fired back at Cohen, writing online:</p>



<p>&#8220;Surprised you&#8217;re okay with violence against female athletes. Peyton suffered serious brain damage &#8211; just one story.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have my cell, always happy to talk privately or publicly on either of our shows because these conversations are reductive to hash out on social media,&#8221; the 40-year old added.</p>



<p>Cohen has yet to publicly respond to McCain&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>McCain has been a frequent guest on Cohen&#8217;s Watch What Happens Live. </p>



<p>The famous host and producer has found himself in the middle <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/andy-cohen-breaks-silence-on-real-housewives-accusations-i-have-no-regrets/">of a few Bravo-related scandals</a> of late&#8230; while his beef with McCain came after a Republican-backed bill that hoped to ban trans athletes from participating in girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s sports failed to pass in Congress on Monday.</p>



<p>The bill defined sex as &#8220;based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth,&#8221; according to The Hill.</p>



<p>The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act received a 51-45 vote, and it needed 60 votes to advance &#8212; meaning that all Republican senators and seven Democrats would have needed to vote in favor of the bill to become law.</p>



<p>Previously, President Trump signed an executive order prohibiting transgender students from competing in girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s sports amid the GOP&#8217;s ongoing attempts to enact anti-trans legislation.</p>

<p>After months of anticipation and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markles-new-netflix-series-postponed-amid-la-wildfires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one unexpected postponement</a>, Meghan Markle&#8217;s new lifestyle show debuted on Netflix today.</p>



<p>As expected, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-will-not-watch-meghan-markles-new-netflix-series-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">With Love, Meghan</a></em> has met with mixed reviews (more on that later), but the real measure of its success will be the sort of viewership numbers it delivers for the world&#8217;s largest streaming service.</p>



<p>Meghan and Prince Harry need a hit here, not only to keep their Netflix deal (thus far, only the first of the couple&#8217;s four projects has been a success), but also to prove that they&#8217;re still relevant and relatable to average Americans.</p>



<p>But Meghan might have forgotten about that part of the mission statement when she corrected friend Mindy Kaling on the proper way to address her in one awkward scene from the show.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1024x572.png" alt="Meghan Markle in a scene from her upcoming Netflix cooking show." class="wp-image-515840" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1024x572.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-2048x1145.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-960x537.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1080x604.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle in a scene from her upcoming Netflix cooking show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-corrects-mindy-for-calling-her-by-the-wrong-name">Meghan corrects Mindy for calling her by the wrong name</h2>



<p>The eminently relatable Mindy seemed to understand the assignment, and she emphasized Meghan&#8217;s commoner side with remarks like,  “People wouldn’t believe that Meghan Markle ate at Jack in the Box.”</p>



<p>But while that&#8217;s obviously how Meghan is most often addressed, it seems she&#8217;s not a fan of her maiden name. </p>



<p>“It’s so funny, too, that you keep saying Meghan Markle. You know I’m Sussex now,” Meghan said to Mindy before explaining how “meaningful” the name is.</p>



<p>“You have kids and you go, ‘No, I share my name with my children,’” Markle noted. “It just means so much to go, ‘This is our family name, our little family name.&#8217;”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-04-at-11.20.33%E2%80%AFAM-1024x610.png" alt="Minkdy Kaling drops in on Meghan Markle on the latter's new Netflix show 'With Love, Meghan.'" class="wp-image-520613"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Minkdy Kaling drops in on Meghan Markle on the latter&#8217;s new Netflix show &#8216;With Love, Meghan.&#8217;<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A contrite Kaling replied, “Now I know. And I love it.”</p>



<p>Perhaps anticipating the mixed reaction to that moment, Meghan addressed the name situation in a <em><a href="https://people.com/meghan-markle-intimate-interview-prince-harry-kids-as-ever-brand-netflix-series-exclusive-11689103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> magazine interview that came out just hours before the show&#8217;s premiere.</p>



<p>“I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H, and I all have together. It means a lot to me,&#8221; she said referring, of course, to son Archie, daughter Lilibet, and Harry.</p>



<p>“I think as the kids get older, they’re so excited about, ‘Oh my gosh, Mama and Papa, how did you meet?’ I think that will come with time as they get older, but for right now a huge part of our love story is that we share the name Sussex,&#8221; Meghan continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-in-a-name">What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="665" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1024x665.png" alt="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a scene from her new Netflix show." class="wp-image-515841" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1024x665.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-300x195.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-768x499.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-2048x1330.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-960x623.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1080x701.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.43-PM-1200x779.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a scene from her new Netflix show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The name issue has been a source of controversy in the past, as Archie and Lilibet were initially denied the titles of &#8220;prince&#8221; and &#8220;princess.&#8221;</p>



<p>The kids were initially called Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Miss Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>



<p>Their titles were updated to Prince Archie of Sussex and Princess Lilibet of Sussex following Queen Elizabeth’s death and King Charles’ ascension to the throne.</p>



<p>As for the initial reaction to Meghan&#8217;s latest creative project, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/04/with-love-meghan-netfix-deal-harry-royals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the initial reviews have been negative</a>, but it&#8217;s worth noting that many of them come from the UK and appear to be politically motivated.</p>

<p>For her part, Meghan mostly steered clear of politics throughout the eight-episode series, but as <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/04/meghan-markle-shades-royal-family-netflix-show-with-love-meghan/">TMZ</a> notes, she may have thrown some subtle shade in the final scene.</p>



<p>While toasting the success of the project, Meghan delivered a speech about &#8220;that creativity that I’ve missed so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also talked about how much she&#8217;s &#8220;missed California&#8221; and the fact that broken things &#8220;can be fixed, sealed, and healed.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not exactly a big middle finger to King Charles, but you can be sure that some folks are interpreting it that way.</p>

<p>Meghan McCain is not here to mince words.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t want to be beat around any bushes.</p>



<p>The former View co-host is about to tell it like it is when it comes to Meghan Markle. Yes, folks, are you ready for some Meghan-on-Meghan crime?</p>

<p>“I cannot stand her,” the 40-year old, said on the February 19 episode of Meghan McCain’s Happy Hour digital series. </p>



<p>“I love people that I can relate to, like every other 40-year-old mom. I don’t want to eat her jam. I love Princess Kate [Middleton].”</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time McCain has criticized Markle. She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-mccain-meghan-markle-feud/">also blasted Markle after seeing the trailer</a> for her relatively new Netflix series, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-unveils-trailer-for-new-netflix-cooking-show-gets-roasted-by-savage-critics/">With Love, From Meghan</a></em>.</p>



<p>“I was originally a Meghan Markle supporter, I thought she was cool, stylish and refreshing. Like the rest of the world my opinion changed when she disrespected the royal family,” McCain Tweeted several weeks ago.</p>



<p>“Now that she wants to be American again instead of British aristocracy what she seems to forget is Americans want real, raw, uncensored. All of this even in the trailer is highly curated, produced and out of touch.”</p>

<p>As for what prompted McCain&#8217;s trashing of Markle in this new case?</p>



<p>Earlier in the week, the mother of two announced via social media that she was renaming her lifestyle brand from American Riviera Orchard to As Ever.</p>



<p>“As ever means ‘as it’s always been’ or some even say ‘in the same way as always,’” Markle explained via Instagram on Tuesday.</p>



<p> “If you’ve followed along since my days of creating The Tig, you’ll know this couldn’t be truer for me. </p>



<p>&#8220;This new chapter is an extension of what has always been my love language, beautifully weaving together everything I cherish — food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="741" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1024x741.jpg" alt="Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagement at The Sunken Gardens at Kensington Palace on November 27, 2017 in London, England." class="wp-image-517126" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-2048x1481.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-960x694.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1080x781.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-880232960-2-1200x868.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagement at The Sunken Gardens at Kensington Palace on November 27, 2017 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After seeing the video announcement, McCain said she was be confused with what Markle is trying to pull off here.</p>



<p>“I don’t know what she’s doing,” the TV personality told guests Perez Hilton and Mary Katharine Ham. “This is, like, her ninth rebrand. I actually had to review her show and her podcast, and it was horrible. It was so boring.”</p>



<p>Previously, McCain expressed disdain for Markle trying to be the next Martha Stewart.</p>



<p>“I would have told her to do a show helping bring fresh food to food deserts in low income neighborhoods,” she said. “Do something to help people instead of your ego.”</p>

<p>During her latest Happy Hour installment, McCain advised Markle, saying she should look to ex-First Lady Michelle Obama as an example of someone who is “very real,&#8221; adding on air:</p>



<p>“She has actually had some of the best marriage advice I’ve ever heard from anyone,” McCain said. </p>



<p>“When I first got pregnant, Michelle Obama had this quote where she was like, ‘Women can have it all, but they can’t have it all at once.’ Your career is inevitably going to suffer if you have a child in one form or another. </p>



<p>&#8220;For me, it was the honesty of that. Meghan Markle’s never going to say, ‘I can’t have it all at once.’”</p>

<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-unveils-trailer-for-new-netflix-cooking-show-gets-roasted-by-savage-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle released the first trailer</a> for her new Netflix lifestyle show.</p>



<p>The series, titled <em>With Love, From Meghan</em>, features the duchess and her celebrity pals cooking meals, arranging flowers, and offering a wide array of tips and tricks for aspiring hosts and hostesses</p>



<p>In other words, it&#8217;s Meghan&#8217;s way of confirming her intention to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become her generation&#8217;s Martha Stewart</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-new-show-meets-with-criticism">Meghan&#8217;s New Show Meets With Criticism</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Martha&#8217;s successs might be a product of a bygone era. </p>



<p>These days, dinner parties are mostly a thing of the past, and folks who are in need of culinary tips are probably finding them on TikTok.</p>



<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-slammed-for-embarrassing-detail-in-new-years-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s latest Netflix project</a> is receiving such an icy reception. </p>



<p>When the trailer debuted on YouTube, haters rushed to the comments section to blast the Duchess of Sussex for being &#8220;tone deaf&#8221; and &#8220;out of touch.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, Meghan has attracted the unwanted attention of one very high-profile critic: media personality and self-described political nepo-baby Meghan McCain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-vs-meghan">Meghan vs. Meghan</h2>





<p>“I was originally a Meghan Markle supporter, I thought she was cool, stylish and refreshing. Like the rest of the world my opinion changed when she disrespected the royal family,” <a href="https://x.com/MeghanMcCain/status/1874951878108455131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McCain wrote </a>on X (formerly Twitter) today.</p>



<p>“Now that she wants to be American again instead of British aristocracy what she seems to forget is Americans want real, raw, uncensored. All of this even in the trailer is highly curated, produced and out of touch.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-682x1024.jpg" alt="Meghan McCain attends the 2023 Time100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 26, 2023 in New York City." class="wp-image-515936" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1485580250-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan McCain attends the 2023 Time100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 26, 2023 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>From there, McCain cited the recent rash of terroristic violence in the US and accused the other Meghan of announcing her posh new project at an inappropriate time.</p>



<p>&#8220;There have been 2 terror attacks in 2 days, major wars raging and Americans can’t pay for groceries. We are a country in rage, uncertainty and intensity right now,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;This concept is ill advised. I would have told her to do a show helping bring fresh food to food deserts in low income neighborhoods. Do something to help people instead of your ego,&#8221; she continued.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2187696856-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex arrives for The Paley Center for Media gala honoring actor and director Tyler Perry, at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills on December 4, 2024.

<p>&#8220;This is why the world doesn’t like you, nothing else. Just completely and utterly tone deaf to the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>McCain&#8217;s remarks echo many of the reactions to the show on YouTube and across social media.</p>



<p>(Although in asserting that &#8220;the world&#8221; doesn&#8217;t like Meghan, McCain went a bit further than most anonymous trolls.)</p>



<p>Obviously, these judgments are premature, as the eight-episode series doesn&#8217;t premiere until January 15.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-lot-on-the-line">A Lot on the Line</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="754" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188304245-754x1024.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, attends The Paley Center for Media hosts Paley Honors Fall Gala honoring Tyler Perry at Beverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel on December 04, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.

<p>But Team Meghan might be feeling a bit nervous at the moment, as the stakes for this project couldn&#8217;t be higher.</p>



<p>Meghan and Prince Harry signed a lucrative deal with Netflix back in 2020, and thus far, the couple has yet to deliver any huge hits.</p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s latest project, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-distancing-themselves-from-polo-series-amid-dismal-reviews-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a docuseries about the world of professional polo</a>, was met with bad reviews and minimal viewership.</p>



<p>Insiders say that after a disappointing 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-returns-to-instagram-rings-in-2025-with-stunning-video-shot-by-prince-harry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry are hoping to make a comeback</a> in the new year.</p>



<p>So they&#8217;d better hope that Netflix subscribers don&#8217;t arrive at the same conclusion that Meghan McCain reached. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll have one more setback to overcome.</p>

<p>One royal expert believes that Prince Harry is deeply uncomfortable with life in the US.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been almost five years since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/01/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-did-they-step-down-to-protect-bab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry and Meghan Markle stepped down</a> as working royals and relocated overseas.</p>



<p>But one observer is convinced that in all that time, Harry still has not grown accustomed to his SoCal lifestyle.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="897" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-1024x897.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex make an official visit to the Joff Youth Centre in Peacehaven, Sussex on October 3, 2018 in Peacehaven, United Kingdom." class="wp-image-512836" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-1024x897.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-768x673.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-2048x1795.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-960x841.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-1080x946.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1045629912-3-1200x1052.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex make an official visit to the Joff Youth Centre in Peacehaven, Sussex on October 3, 2018 in Peacehaven, United Kingdom.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-is-flying-solo-expert-believes">Prince Harry Is &#8216;Flying Solo,&#8217; Expert Believes</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/prince-harry-wants-space-from-meghan-markle-as-divorce-rumors-circulate-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry and Meghan have been appearing separately </a>much more often in recent months.</p>



<p>Most royal watchers believe that the move is part of a calculated rebranding effort on the Sussexes&#8217; part.</p>



<p>According to recent polls, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-who-is-the-most-popular-royal-of-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry and Meghan are less popular than ever</a>. </p>



<p>And they may feel that they can rebound if they establish themselves in the public&#8217;s eye as individuals, rather than just two halves of a couple.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="698" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-906665940-1024x698.jpg" alt="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle watch a performance by a Welsh choir in the banqueting hall during a visit to Cardiff Castle on January 18, 2018 in Cardiff, Wales.

<p>Despite recent career setbacks, Meghan is not giving up on her dream of becoming <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/martha-stewart-vs-meghan-markle-lifestyle-brands-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her generation&#8217;s Martha Stewart</a>.</p>



<p>And royal journalist Phil Dampier believes the situation has left Harry longing for his old life.</p>



<p>&lt;</p>



<p>“Meghan is concentrating on her American Rivera Orchard lifestyle brand which is dependent on Netflix, while Harry has been flying solo with his charity work,&#8221; Dampier recently told <em>Fabulous</em> magazine (via <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/royals/12843092/prince-harry-bored-showbiz-pals-drifted-royal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>).</p>



<p>“He clearly feels a need to return to the UK and Africa for various causes like the Wellchild Charity and Sentebale in Lesotho, and I think he wants to look up old friends he has drifted apart from.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-harry-is-uncomfortable-with-meghan-says-journalist">Prince Harry is &#8216;Uncomfortable&#8217; With Meghan, Says Journalist</h2>



<p>“Sometimes in the US, he looks uncomfortable or just plain bored when he is out and about with Meghan at showbiz or sporting events,&#8221; Dampier continues.</p>



<p>He further claims that the Duke of Sussex often appeared out of sorts during his recent travels with Meghan.</p>



<p>“And during their trips this year to Colombia and Nigeria he looked like a bolt-on accessory while she seemed to be the dominant partner. </p>

<p>But despite this discomfort, Dampier believes it&#8217;s unlikely that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/prince-harry-meghan-markle-royal-reconcile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry and Meghan will return to the UK</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Meghan is not popular,&#8221; he says, adding:</p>



<p>“She doesn&#8217;t want to come back and they are going their own ways, to some extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meghan McCain has some things to say about Jennifer Lopez.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s not the only one. J. Lo&#8217;s unpopularity may have reached a <em>tipping point</em>.</p>



<p>Amidst her flopped tour, a couple of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/atlas-ending-explained-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not very good movies</a>, and rumors of an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-tracker-their-house-is-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impending divorce from Ben Affleck</a>, she&#8217;s seen better days.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, criticism from Meghan McCain is a badge of honor. But this may be one of those rare cases where John McCain&#8217;s daughter is making some solid points.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jennifer-lopez-is-deeply-unpleasant-says-meghan-mccain">Jennifer Lopez is &#8216;deeply unpleasant,&#8217; says Meghan McCain</h2>



<p>Meghan McCain, former primary antagonist of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/the-view-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The View</a></em> and outspoken daughter of the late Senator John McCain, spoke on the Friday, June 7 episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/carlos-king-explains-why-rhonj-is-unwatchable/id1710616965?i=1000658152905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Citizen McCain</em> podcast</a>.</p>



<p>“I, too, share similar negative stories that the entire world does,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I feel bad because we’re turning a point where there’s bullying happening to J. Lo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meghan bluntly stated: “She just is a deeply unpleasant person.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jennifer Lopez in May of 2024." class="wp-image-501517" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez poses during the &#8216;Atlas&#8217; Mexico City Fan Event at Plaza Toreo Parque Central on May 21, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Hector Vivas/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There was more to Meghan McCain&#8217;s critique of Jennifer Lopez than simply the singer&#8217;s lack of people skills.</p>



<p>&#8220;She had the biggest entourage I’ve ever seen [when she was on&nbsp;‘The View’],&#8221; she recalled.</p>



<p>Meghan McCain alleged that she&#8217;d arrived with &#8220;More than&nbsp;Kim Kardashian&nbsp;and the president.” She added that she didn&#8217;t “really understand why it was needed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-jennifer-lopez-get-meghan-mccain-s-tiktok-video-taken-down">Did Jennifer Lopez get Meghan McCain&#8217;s TikTok video taken down?</h2>



<p>McCain alleged that Lopez &#8220;had our video taken down.&#8221; She then added an &#8220;allegedly,&#8221; as she has no proof to back up that claim.</p>



<p>Specifically, Meghan McCain had said on TikTok that Jennifer Lopez was not her &#8220;favorite&#8221; guest during her time on <em>The View</em>.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0"> Though McCain cannot confirm who reported her video (and was able to get it reinstated within hours), she seems to genuinely believe that J. Lo is behind the erstwhile takedown notice.</p>

</div></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0">Thinking back to Jennifer Lopez&#8217;s guest appearance on The View, she described finding the singer with one of her minions holding &#8220;a mirror with lights while they were touching her up backstage.&#8221;</p>



<p>That isn&#8217;t an accusation of bad behavior. It is, rather, a description of excessive behavior that McCain found to be unbecoming.</p>



<p>“I was a host at ‘The View,’ she was not nice,&#8221; Meghan McCain assessed. &#8220;You don’t always have to be so nice, but it was surprising that people like Kim Kardashian couldn’t be more delightful.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="844" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-844x1024.jpg" alt="Jennifer Lopez in May of 2024 for the Atlas premiere." class="wp-image-501519" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-844x1024.jpg 844w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-247x300.jpg 247w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-768x932.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-1687x2048.jpg 1687w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-791x960.jpg 791w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-890x1080.jpg 890w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02-989x1200.jpg 989w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_02.jpg 1980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez arrives at the premiere of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Atlas&#8221; at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood on May 20, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-most-celebrity-guests-can-at-least-pretend-to-be-friendly">Most celebrity guests can at least pretend to be friendly</h2>



<p>McCain then suggested: “When you’re coming on a show for a 10-minute segment … just fake it ’til you make it for 10 f–king minutes.”</p>



<p>Though that&#8217;s not generally what &#8220;fake it &#8217;til you make it&#8221; means, it&#8217;s otherwise not bad advice.</p>



<p>Most people can emulate friendliness for short periods of time, just to be polite or make a good impression. Of those who do not, the majority of people are making a choice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Jennifer Lopez on Her Journey to Happiness at 50 | The View" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7kFUsuBVDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>McCain&#8217;s account of Lopez matches a lot of the general reputation that she has. That said, a lack of friendliness is not an immoral behavior. It doesn&#8217;t leave a good impression, but it doesn&#8217;t make someone a bad person.</p>



<p>At the same time, many people who already believed Lopez to be a bad person are taking this as confirmation of existing <em>bad vibes</em>.</p>



<p>Numerous reports and anecdotal accounts describe <a href="https://www.shefinds.com/collections/jennifer-lopez-strict-rules-ben-affleck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez not tipping servers</a> and even insisting that Ben Affleck undertip or not tip servers. Unlike being unfriendly towards Meghan McCain, that alleged behavior <em>is </em>immoral. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="760" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1024x760.jpg" alt="Jennifer Lopez in early May of 2024." class="wp-image-501520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1024x760.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-300x223.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-768x570.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-2048x1521.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-960x713.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1080x802.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0610_jenniferlopez_03-1200x891.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer Lopez attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-said">That said &#8230;</h2>



<p>Some on social media have likened Meghan McCain&#8217;s issues with Jennifer Lopez to an <em>Alien vs Predator</em> conflict. This is a reference to that film&#8217;s tagline: &#8220;Whoever wins, we lose.&#8221;</p>



<p>McCain herself is notorious, and for more than just having a bloated entourage. From petulant on-camera behavior to having notoriously bad takes, she has spent the past decade and a half alienating most of her now-former fans.</p>



<p>Beefing with Jennifer Lopez is well and good. But perhaps Meghan McCain does not have much high ground in this feud.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/meghan-markle-prince-harry-demoted-along-with-prince-andrew-following-queens-death/">Queen Elizabeth II passed away</a>, and her son took over as the UK&#8217;s monarch, there were rumors that King Charles&#8217; first order of business would be to reunite his divided family.</p>



<p>That item may have been at the top of the king&#8217;s agenda, but sadly, it proved easier said than done.</p>



<p>In fact, nearly a year after Charles&#8217; ascension to the throne, his two sons are more at odds than ever.</p>



<p>The combination of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/prince-harry-negative-reaction-to-memoir-has-put-strain-on-marriage-to-meghan-markle-royal-expert-claims/">Harry&#8217;s memoir </a>and William&#8217;s testy reaction to it has driven a larger wedge between the two princes, but it looks as though Charles is still hoping to bring them back together.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12350123/As-King-Charles-heads-Balmoral-weekend-REBECCA-ENGLISH-reveals-bittersweet-secrets-summer-Scottish-castle-without-late-Queen.html">new report</a> from the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Harry and Meghan have been invited to join the rest of the royals when the Windsor clan retreats to Scotland for a vacation at Balmoral Castle next month.</p>



<p>“All family members are expected to stay [at Balmoral Castle] at some point over the next few weeks,” claims the <em>Mail</em>&#8216;s royal editor, Rebecca English writes.</p>



<p>“That is, except the Duke and Duchess of Sussex whose ‘open invitation’ to join family gatherings hasn’t exactly been rescinded, but is certainly not expected to be accepted.”</p>

<p><br>Yes, according to English, the offer is on the table, and all Harry and Meghan need to do is accept.</p>



<p>Insiders believe that if they make the trip, it could be the start of a healing process that would lead to a restored royal family.</p>



<p>“If true, that can only be a good thing and may offer a sliver of hope that at some point in the future personal relationships can be rebuilt,” a source tells the outlet. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="783" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-1024x783.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-458184" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-1024x783.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-300x229.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-768x587.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-1536x1175.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-2048x1566.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-735x562.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-335x256.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-347x265.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-520x398.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-640x489.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-960x734.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243229572-1080x826.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Harry and Meghan participate in a memorial service for the Queen. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s been a very visibly challenging year when it comes to the Sussexes.”</p>



<p>As with all matters pertaining to the royal family, this situation is already being dissected and magnified by royal-watchers the world over.</p>



<p>Some have gone so far as to suggest that it could be the first step toward <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-to-royal-family-please-take-us-back/">Harry and Meghan returning to royal life</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Insiders say Harry and Meghan felt snubbed after seeing King Charles&#8217; first official photo. So the couple released a portrait of their own. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But that&#8217;s almost certainly not the case.</p>



<p>“This would be one of the most bizarre events in royal history if they did return after all the attacks,” royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams tells the <em>Mail</em>. </p>



<p>“It would be a humiliation for Meghan and Harry,&#8221; Fitzwilliams continues.</p>

<p>“The idea that after everything that has happened that Meghan and Harry could just walk back in is beyond extraordinary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, the idea that that Harry and Meghan have any desire to return to royal life seems rather far-fetrched.</p>



<p>And the couple might not be welcomed back into the fold even if they wanted to be.</p>



<p>But even so &#8212; the Sussexes have a chance to send a powerful message to the world by joining Charles on vacation.</p>



<p>And they might be wise to seize this opportunity and regain control of their narrative.</p>

<p>The announcement came shortly after Prince Harry arrived at his family&#8217;s Balmoral estate in Scotland, where the Queen spent her final days.</p>



<p>Along with his wife, Meghan Markle, Harry was in London when he received news of his grandmother&#8217;s failing health.</p>



<p>(Like Prince Williams&#8217; wife, Kate Middleton, Meghan remained in London to look after the children while her husband made the trip to Balmoral.)</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan have resided in Montecito, California since 2020, but the couple traveled to the UK earlier this week as part of a humanitarian tour that&#8217;s generated considerable controversy in the British media.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The couple has been accused of trying to<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/meghan-markle-tried-failed-to-turn-royal-family-woke-source-claims/"> establish &#8220;their own royal family&#8221;</a> by creating the impression that their tour is official state business.</p>



<p>Harry and Meghan have never made any such claims, of course, but the UK tabloid press will take any opportunity to denigrate the Duchess, even if it means finding fault with a charity tour.</p>



<p>And now, some of Meghan&#8217;s harshest critics have decided to the seize Queen&#8217;s death as yet another chance to vent their irrational hatred.</p>

<p>Some threw their shade subtly, pointing out that prior to today, Harry and Meghan did not spend any time with his family during their current trip to the UK.</p>



<p>&#8220;Very sad for Prince Harry that &#8211; despite being in the UK &#8211; he didn’t get to see his grandmother, The Queen, before she passed away,&#8221; wrote ITV royal editor Chris Ship.</p>



<p>&#8220;They were very close and he spoke to her often despite his decision to leave the Royal Family.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I blame his American wife,&#8221; read one reply to Ship&#8217;s tweet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I have no sympathy for Harry as he brought this all on himself. He allowed that witch he is married to to destroy the Queen and she made him choose between his family and her. Live with it Harry,&#8221; wrote another critic.</p>



<p>&#8220;He did it to himself. I’m not sad for him. We all make our own beds,&#8221; tweeted a third fount of compassion.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Meghan continues to have more supporters than detractors, and thousands of them have come to her defense today.</p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Kate Middleton not going up to Balmoral because of childcare is all fine and good but Meghan Markle basically doing the same isn’t? the racism is jumping out once again,&#8221; journalist Shahed Ezayd tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re taking joy in news of the Queen&#8217;s health, foolishly blaming Meghan Markle or anything of the like, that&#8217;s not cool,&#8221; attorney Don Lewis wrote</p>



<p>&#8220;If you’re flooding social media with how Prince Harry &amp; Meghan Markle have led to Queen Elizabeth’s stress &amp; poor health, but are not mentioning Prince Andrew, you’ve clearly bought into the British media hate campaign against them,&#8221; the popular Tudor Chick account observed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>All of this comes on the heels of new criticism from one of Meghan&#8217;s most high-profile haters, former<em> Real Housewives of New York City</em> star Bethenny Frankel who decried “this Meghan Markle s–tshow&#8221; on her TikTok page.</p>



<p>“Maybe I’ll be canceled for saying this … but I just think we have to be able to say something without getting beaten down,” Frankel said in her latest video. </p>



<p>“She is a terrible, terrible businessperson [and] strategist. She’s playing checkers, not chess because she is overplaying her hand, and she is painting herself into a corner, becoming a woman without a country.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The beef between these two goes back to the time of Meghan&#8217;s interview with Oprah in 2021, when Bethenny criticized the Duchess for speaking so openly about her royal in-laws.</p>



<p>“She’s a polarizing person, don’t get it twisted,” Frankel said this week of the criticism she received at the time. </p>



<p>“It was brutal, I’m not going to lie. It would have been so easy to just not say anything … and now the tide’s turned [on her]. … It may not be the message, it’s the messenger.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Bethenny Frankel has been talking a lot of trash lately. (Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As one of the few insiders to ever speak truthfully about life among the royals, Meghan is likely to become a popular target of a lot of unfounded criticism in the days to come.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s important to remember that most of the people who are hurling insults at the Duchess of Sussex now have been harboring hatred from the moment they first laid eyes on her.</p>



<p>Meghan is a woman of color; she&#8217;s a divorced, American former actress &#8212; the list of reasons she&#8217;s been discriminated against is a sad and lengthy one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-456796" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1409487825-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle make an appearance at the UN.(Photo via Getty)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Of course, today seems like a good day to bear in mind that were it not for an earlier divorced, American actress, Elizabeth never would have become Queen.</p>



<p>Back in 1936, King Edward VII abdicated in order to pursue his relationship with Wallis Simpson &#8212; a woman who had an awful lot in common with Meghan.</p>



<p>Because of Edward&#8217;s scandalous affair and resulting abdication, his brother, George VI became king.</p>

<p></p>



<p>When George passed away in 1952, his daughter Elizabeth acceded to the throne, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>



<p>Fate works in strange ways, and no one could have predicted that a transcontinental love affair that began in 1934 would lead to a reign that continued until 2022.</p>



<p>Just as no one could have predicted that a former actress on a basic cable legal drama would one day cause mass psychosis throughout the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>You know what they say about The View, right?</p>
<p>You can leave the daytime talk show behind, but this doesn&#8217;t mean that those who still make a living by talking about current events on that program will leave <em>you</em> alone.</p>
<p>Not very catchy or pithy.</p>
<p>But someone probably said it at least once.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s also a relevant saying at the moment because Meghan McCain &#8212; who <a href="/2021/07/meghan-mccain-see-ya-im-quitting-the-view/">departed The View back in July</a> &#8212; is once again feuding with Joy Behar.</p>
<p>For the most asinine of reasons.</p>
<p>It all started after McCain wrote a seemingly innocuous post on February 14, tagging her husband and writing simply:</p>
<p>&quot;Happy Valentines Day @bdomenech &ndash; I love you and am grateful every day for the life we have together.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In response to McCain&#8217;s message, a Twitter user asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Does every thought and sentiment need to be on Twitter?&quot;</p>
<p>And, in response to <em>that</em> remark, Behar wrote in a since-deleted tweet, <strong><em>Apparently</em></strong>.</p>
<p>What a random thing to get upset about, right? What an odd way to take a jab at a former co-worker/foe, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Imagine spending your Valentines Day trolling your ex colleagues tweet about her husband,&quot; fired back McCain on her social media page, alongside a screengrab of their Twitter exchange.</p>
<p>When Fox News host and weather anchor Janice Dean pointed out that Behar &quot;can&#8217;t quit you&quot;, McCain responded to her Tweet, referring to Behar&#8217;s actions as &quot;pathetic&quot; and adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It creeps me out.&quot;</p>
<p>In a since-deleted tweet off her own, McCain also wrote that walking away from The View &quot;is like having ex&#8217;s who won&#8217;t stop drunk texting you.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain left the show last summer, partly because she returned from maternity leave shortly beforehand &#8212; only for Behar to admit on air that she did NOT miss her conservative co-anchor.</p>
<p>In her memoir, McCain said she &quot;felt like [she&#8217;d] been slapped&quot; at the time, adding that she &quot;burst into tears&quot; and was &quot;uncontroll[ably] sobbing&quot; when they cut to commercial.</p>
<p>&quot;Until that moment it hadn&#8217;t even occurred to me that Joy hadn&#8217;t missed me,&quot; McCain wrote.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain alleges that when she asked for an apology from Behar over this snub, producers told her that no mea culpa was coming.</p>
<p>And this is when she knew what she had to go: quit.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a look at my life outside of myself and I thought clearly &#8212; this s&#8212; isn&#8217;t worth this,&quot; wrote McCain in the aforementioned book, adding elsewhere:</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;s supposed to be my friend and it&#8217;s supposed to be a sisterhood. I&#8217;ll never forget. I went back to my office and I had a panic attack. I was crying. I was hyperventilating. I threw up.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>McCain, meanwhile, also chimed in this month after Whoopi Goldberg claimed that the <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-holocaust-remarks/">Holocast wasn&#8217;t about race</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not calling for Whoopi Goldberg to be fired, if only because I don&#8217;t believe there is any universe where she could possibly do anything that could get her fired &#8212; she is the crown jewel of The View and a pop culture icon,&quot; <a href="/2022/02/meghan-mccain-destroys-whoopi-goldberg-her-half-assed-holocaust/">said McCain amid this controversy</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hope this can be used as a teachable moment to explain to millions of Americans why conflating the Holocaust as something that is specific and limited to &#8216;white people&#8217; is insane, ahistorical and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>&quot;For as much as the left is fond of using Nazi comparisons and imagery, the truth of the Holocaust, who it targeted and why, deserves to be known and understood by all.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldberd got suspended for two weeks by ABC for her comment and returned to work on Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Meghan McCain doesn&#8217;t think Whoopi Goldberg should be left off the hook.</p>
<p>Very, very far from it.</p>
<p>On Monday&#8217;s episode of The View,&nbsp;Goldberg made a very strange and wildly misguided statement&nbsp;during a conversation about the Tennessee school board&rsquo;s ban of &ldquo;Maus,&rdquo; a nonfiction graphic novel about cartoonist Art Spiegelman&rsquo;s father&#8217;s experience as a Holocaust survivor.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be truthful about it because [the] Holocaust isn&rsquo;t about race,&rdquo; Goldberg said in response at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about race.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s about man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unusual take drew immediate, sweeping criticism from Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the U.S. Holocaust Museum&#8230; and it led to an apology by Goldberg on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;I said something that I feel a responsibility for not leaving unexamined because my words upset so many people, which was never my intention,&quot; the actress said on air yesterday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;And I understand why now, and for that I am deeply, deeply grateful because the information I got was really helpful and it helped me understand some different things.&quot;</p>
<p>The Holocaust &quot;is indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race,&quot; Goldberg continued, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Now, words matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know, and as you all know because I&rsquo;ve always done that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sincere words? Maybe.</p>
<p>But <a href="/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-race-based-holocaust/">ABC suspended Goldberg on Tuesday night</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments,&quot; ABC News President Kim Godwin said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;While Whoopi has apologized, I&#8217;ve asked her to take time and reflect and learn about the impact of her comments.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family, and communities.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This brings us back to Meghan McCain.</p>
<p>The former View co-host penned a damning op/ed for The Daily Mail on Tuesday, trashing Goldberg&#8217;s mea culpa a &quot;half-assed apology&quot; and taking her to task for previous remarks about Roman Polaski and Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>&quot;I was lectured to thousands of times on The View, there is a belief that &#8216;cancel culture&#8217; is really &#8216;accountability culture&#8217; among the woke left,&quot; wrote McCain.</p>
<p>&quot;Which seems to be a belief that&#8217;s quickly forgotten whenever it&#8217;s Whoopi who has to be held to account.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>To be clear, McCain wrote all of this before Goldberg&#8217;s suspension was announced.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not calling for Whoopi Goldberg to be fired, if only because I don&#8217;t believe there is any universe where she could possibly do anything that could get her fired &#8212; she is the crown jewel of The View and a pop culture icon,&quot; continued to daughter of former Presidential nominee John McCain.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hope this can be used as a teachable moment to explain to millions of Americans why conflating the Holocaust as something that is specific and limited to &#8216;white people&#8217; is insane, ahistorical and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>&quot;For as much as the left is fond of using Nazi comparisons and imagery, the truth of the Holocaust, who it targeted and why, deserves to be known and understood by all.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain believes &quot;liberal hosts are held to an entirely different standard than anyone else,&quot; adding in her piece:</p>
<p>&quot;Whoopi has said a slew of insanely-controversial and hurtful things over the course of her tenure at The View.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the more notorious ones include defending Roman Polanski for raping a 13-year-old (calling it &#8216;not rape, rape&#8217;) and defending Bill Cosby after over 50 accusers had come out publicly with their stories.</p>
<p>&quot;With age and status comes protection at The View.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>McCain went on to asserted that some folks &quot;will never face the same ramifications and repercussions that others will,&quot; referring to this as a &quot;double, triple, and even quadruple standard if you are conservative.&quot;</p>
<p>She cited Roseanne Barr and Sharon Osbourne as examples of so-called canceled Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;There are those who will be given protection and coverage for their bad behavior from networks and executives no matter what,&quot; McCain wrote.</p>

<p>Toward the end of her op-ed, McCain mentioned that The View founder Barbara Walters is &quot;one of the most famous Jewish American women in American history&quot; and that she doesn&#8217;t believe &quot;a show of one myopic opinion was her intention.&quot;</p>
<p>No response yet to this scathing criticism from McCain.</p>
<p>Not frrom Goldberg and not from ABC.</p>
