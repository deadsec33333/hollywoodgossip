<p>Tom Hanks has been described as &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/tom-hanks-mocks-donald-trump-supporters-gets-dragged-by-team-maga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">America&#8217;s dad</a>,&#8221; due to his warm, paternal onscreen persona.</p>



<p>And the screen legend&#8217;s private and public lives are in alignment there, as he enjoys close relationships with all four of his adult children.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that all of the Hanks kids enjoyed happy, healthy upbringings.</p>



<p>In fact, Tom&#8217;s eldest daughter, Elizabeth &#8212; who goes by E.A. Hanks professionally &#8212; is soon to release a memoir detailing her chaotic and damaging childhood.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-e-a-hanks-suffered-a-chaotic-unstable-childhood">E.A. Hanks suffered a chaotic, unstable childhood</h2>



<p>Along with her brother Colin, E.A. is a product of Tom&#8217;s short-lived marriage to fellow actor Samantha Lewes, who died from cancer in 2002 at the age of 49.</p>



<p>The couple married in 1977, welcomed E.A. in &#8217;82, separated in 85, and divorced two years later.</p>



<p>Lewes was initially granted primary custody in the split, and according to E.A., the years she spent living with her mother resulted in lasting trauma.</p>



<p>“She pushed me, shook me, pulled at my hair and locked me in a closet once or twice … she told me there were men hiding in her closet who were waiting for us to go to sleep to come out and do horrible things,” Hanks writes, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/04/celebrity-news/tom-hanks-daughter-e-a-details-effects-of-abusive-childhood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>Lewes would reportedly carry on about “dozens of miscarried babies, [E.A.’s] lost siblings,” and insinuate that she would eventually “join them in eternal limbo.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="719" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-1024x719.jpg" alt="Samantha Bryant, Colin Hanks, Rita Wilson, Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Ann Hanks, Chet Hanks, and Truman Theodore Hanks attend the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 05, 2020 in Beverly Hills, California." class="wp-image-522834" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-1024x719.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-300x211.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-768x539.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-2048x1438.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-960x674.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-1080x758.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1197746560-1200x842.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Samantha Bryant, Colin Hanks, Rita Wilson, Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Ann Hanks, Chet Hanks, and Truman Theodore Hanks attend the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 05, 2020 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>E.A. notes that there were occasional fun times, too &#8212; though in some ways, they were equally chaotic.</p>



<p>Lewes would drive her children “all over California to horse shows at ungodly hours” and “cut up cookie dough for my friends sleeping over and let me dye my hair every color I wanted.”</p>



<p>It was only when E.A. moved in with her father and his second wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-wilson-are-doing-fine-son-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rita Wilson</a>, that she gained any sense of what a normal childhood looked like.</p>



<p>She realized, she writes, that “there should have been more food in the house on a regular basis” and that being awoken in the middle of the night to hear “an impromptu lecture on why yoga was the devil’s work&#8221; was not the sort of thing that most kids are subjected to.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Truman Theodore Hanks, and Elizabeth Hanks attend the 92nd Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood and Highland on February 09, 2020 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-522835" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1205142257-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Truman Theodore Hanks, and Elizabeth Hanks attend the 92nd Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood and Highland on February 09, 2020 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-lingering-effects-of-childhood-trauma">The lingering effects of childhood trauma</h2>



<p>To this day, E.A. writes, she struggles with many of the duties of adulthood, as they were never modeled for her when she was young.</p>



<p>She says she was in her thirties before it occurred to her that she should start seeing a dentist regularly, and she still struggles to “keep food in my house on a consistent basis.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sadly, E.A.&#8217;s experiences are relatable to tens of millions of Americans.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re sure many will find comfort in the knowledge that that sort of dysfunction can be overcome &#8212; and that it can even be found in the family of America&#8217;s dad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>As you may have heard, Saturday Night Live celebrated its 50th anniversary on Sunday night.</p>



<p>The show was generally well received, too, with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/ryan-reynolds-jokes-about-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-legal-battle-at-snl-50/">Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively making their first</a> public appearance since It Ends With Us Gate and with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kim-kardashian-pete-davidson-spotted-chatting-at-snl-50-afterparty-reconciliation-on-the-horizon/">Pete Davidson reuniting</a> with ex-lover Kim Kardashian.</p>



<p>But a bunch of people on social media are shaking their heads over one particular segment on the special.</p>



<p>And it featured Tom Hanks &#8230; of all, non-normally-controversial people.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="410" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22809-1739805497-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-519486" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22809-1739805497-1.webp 700w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22809-1739805497-1-300x176.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Hanks on the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary special.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (NBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The multiple-time Oscar winner made a cameo on the Black Jeopardy sketch, appearing as the character of a Donald Trump voter named Doug.</p>



<p>Wearing a Make America Great Again red baseball cap, Hanks jokingly refused to shake hands with Kenan Thompson (presumably due to his skin color) and acted in general like a dumb and racist doofus.</p>



<p>Just like the average Donald Trump supporter?</p>



<p>This seemed to be what Saturday Night Live was getting at, wouldn&#8217;t you agree?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519487" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200084851-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson attend SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Trump, of course, just won the Presidency for the second time in November and was sworn in to the oval office on January 20.</p>



<p>He even won the popular vote this time around.</p>



<p>Like him, hate him or think he&#8217;s a wannabe dictator who hates poor people and minorities and has no concept of policy in any way, shape or form&#8230; one cannot argue that Trump has many fans out there.</p>



<p>Which is why many of them jumped on Instagram and Twitter in the wake of Hanks&#8217; SNL cameo and made their opinions on the sketch well known.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="875" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22853-1739806103-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-519488" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22853-1739806103-1.webp 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/sub-buzz-22853-1739806103-1-206x300.webp 206w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here is a sampling of some of the harshest critiques:</p>



<p><em><strong>This show wonders why their ratings are in the gutter. Trump won the popular vote. This tired trope that MAGA is racist is disgusting.</strong></em> </p>



<p><em><strong>SNL acts like they get payouts from USAID too. DOGE should audit them.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong><em>SNL just went off my radar.</em></strong></p>



<p>Hanks did have some folks in his corner, however. To wit:</p>



<p><strong><em>Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor. He really captured the look and vacant eyes of MAGA cult folks.</em></strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Bless Tom Hanks. There’s not enough money on the planet for me to wear that stupid ass cap.</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>I saw someone complain about the bit with Tom hanks because it politicized the sketch…….. exactly what show do you think you’re watching.</strong></em></p>

<p>Late on Sunday, Tom Hanks took to Twitter to deliver some good news. We could all use some of that right now.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, folks,&quot; the beloved actor begins. &quot;Two weeks after our first symptoms and we feel better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sheltering in place works like this,&quot; he explains. &quot;You don&#8217;t give it to anyone &#8211; You don&#8217;t get it from anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Common sense, no?&quot; he asks.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Going to take awhile,&quot; Tom Hanks continues his tweet.</p>
<p>&quot;But if we take care of each other, help where we can, and give up some comforts,&quot; he assures.</p>
<p>Tom continues: &quot;&#8230; this, too, shall pass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can figure it out,&quot; he concludes, signing off: &quot;Hanx.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Tom and Rita are both 63 years old, which puts them into the &quot;at risk&quot; category for COVID-19, though <em>anyone </em>could potentially have a severe case.</p>
<p>(Fortunately for them, they are rich and famous, which does not make you immune to illness but it guarantees first-rate help)</p>
<p>The two experienced symptoms before being tested, and then were quarantined in a Queensland hospital.</p>
<p>After five days of hospital quarantine, they were quarantined at their Queensland home, where they have remained since then.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-682x1024.jpg" alt="Tom Hanks and Rita" class="wp-image-343138" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-735x1104.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-346x520.jpg 346w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-426x640.jpg 426w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-511x768.jpg 511w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches,&quot; Tom previously characterized their symptoms.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too.&quot;</p>
<p>This is consistent with reports of milder cases of COVID-19, which is why many people may have had it and gotten better without knowing it.</p>
<p>At the same time, thousands have died &#8212; approximately three deaths when compared to every 20 who make a successful recovery.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;One week after testing Positive, in self-isolation, the symptoms are much the same,&quot; Tom Hanks previously updated.</p>
<p>He characterized their state of being as &quot;No fever but the blahs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Folding the laundry and doing the dishes leads to a nap on the couch,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>We wish him, Rita, and the countless others all over the globe who have or will have the virus a speedy, healthy recovery.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to responsibly talk about Tom Hanks&#8217; tweet without talking about some of the comments beneath it.</p>
<p>Tom is one of many famous targets of a conspiracy theory that experts refer to as &quot;cuckoo bananas.&quot; That&#8217;s the technical term.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are a group of people on the fringes of society who are a little unhinged.</p>
<p>They believe in a worldwide conspiracy of celebrities who <em>torture children in order to extract a fictional drug</em> from said children and then get high.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>There&#8217;s more to it &#8212; the political slant of these conspiracy believers is decidedly pro-Trump and they also think that demons are involved.</p>
<p>They believe that the coronavirus (those of them who believe that it exists) is just a convenient cover to let &quot;white hats&quot; arrest these celebs.</p>
<p>It is their belief that these secret arrests are a prelude to mass arrests of all of those involved, coupled with martial law, which they welcome.</p>
<p>Therefore, they believe that Tom is claiming to be quarantined as a &quot;cover&quot; for being arrested.</p>
<p>These people all have worms in their brains and their unhinged beliefs are an insult to good, decent people like Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.</p>

<p>Because he&#8217;s been <a href="/2020/03/tom-hanks-has-been-diagnosed-with-the-coronavirus/">diagnosed with the Coronavirus</a>? No.</p>
<p>But because he seemingly just broke some seriously Australian eating etiquette.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In a new update posted on Instagram on Sunday, the 63-year-old superstar channeled beloved children&#8217;s TV character Mister Rogers &#8212; who he portrayed in the 2019 film <em>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</em> &#8212; by quoting the legendary personality as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to the Helpers. Let&#8217;s take care of ourselves and each other. Hanx.&quot;</p>
<p>On <em>Mister Rogers&#8217; Neighborhood</em>, which aired from 1968 to 2001, the host told viewers that his mother always advised him to &quot;look for the helpers&quot; during times of trouble.</p>
<p>This was encouraging advice, meant to help people see the best in any given situation.</p>

<p>It was the perfect message from Hanks.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t accompanied by the perfect photo.</p>
<p>You see, Hanks and wife Rita Wilson have been isolated in Australia ever since their diagnosis, with the actor posting a photo of some toast with Vegemite along with his inspiring message.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve shared below, and then we&#8217;ve shared why it&#8217;s stirred up quite the controversy:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to many observers, Hanks spread way too much of the aforementioned Australian delicacy on his two pieces of bread.</p>
<p>Like, way, WAY too much of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Tom, that&#8217;s lovely but you spread the Vegemite way too thick,&quot; author Jane Caro tweeted, for example, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;The secret to Vegemite toast is 1/3 Vegemite to 2/3 butter maximum. And add smashed avocado for extra awesomeness.&quot;</p>
<p>Added TV host Michael Rowland: &quot;Gee, that&#8217;s a lot of Vegemite.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The controversy has exploded to such an extent that Tom&#8217;s son, Colin Hanks, also weighed in via Twitter.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve been saying, &#8216;That&#8217;s way too much for one piece of toast,&#8217; to him for years,&quot; the actor wrote.</p>
<p>Hanks and Wilson, who were Down Under for the pre-production of Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s Elvis Presley movie, were tested for coronavirus after feeling under the weather last Wednesday.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches,&quot; the star wrote on Instagram last week, explaining;</p>
<p>&quot;Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.&quot;</p>
<p>He then explained &quot;we Hanks&#8217; will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>More than 6,400 people have died of the novel coronavirus and at least 167,000 have tested positive for it in more than 110 countries since it was discovered in Wuhan, China late last year.</p>
<p>In the United States, numerous cities have shut down schools, restaurants, bars and nearly all public establishment.</p>
<p>This has been declared a &quot;global pandemic&quot; by the World Health Organization.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In a previous update to his own condition, <a href="/2020/03/tom-hanks-updates-fans-on-his-heath-reminds-everyone-why-hes-the/">Hanks wrote</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;Hello folks. @ritawilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us.</p>
<p>&quot;We have Covid-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one-day-at-a-time.</p>
<p>&quot;There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Finally, paraphrasing his famous line from A League of Their Own, he wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball.&quot;</p>
<p>This guy is the best.</p>

<p>This is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Can you name any more popular celebrity?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Perhaps for this reason, the admission by Hanks and wife Rita Wilson on Wednesday night &#8212; that <a href="/2020/03/tom-hanks-has-been-diagnosed-with-the-coronavirus/">they have contracted COVID-19</a>, commonly known as the Coronavirus &#8212; was a tipping point for many observers.</p>
<p>Yes, even a two-time Academy Award winner can be affected by this virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, folks,&quot; Hanks wrote at the time on Instagram, adding in full detail:</p>
<p>&quot;Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.&quot;</p>
<p>According to various outlets, the famous couple was Down Under for the pre-production of Baz Luhrmann&rsquo;s untitled Elvis Presley film from Warner Bros.</p>
<p>In this movie, the legendary star portrays Presley&rsquo;s longtime manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p>

<p>&quot;The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed,&quot; Tom continued.</p>
<p>&quot;We Hanks&rsquo; will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?&quot;</p>
<p>The actor then concluded as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Not long after Hanks and Wilson opened up about their diagnosis, sons <a href="/2020/03/tom-hanks-and-rita-wilson-are-doing-fine-son-says/">Chet and Colin thanked supporters</a> for their outpouring of affection and confirmed that their parents were doing fine.</p>
<p>And now Tom and Rita have gone ahead and done the same thing themselves.</p>
<p>In classic Tom Hanks fashion.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Hello folks,&quot; Hanks captioned a cheerful selfie of the couple, which we posted at the top of this post.</p>
<p>&quot;@ritawilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;We have Covid-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else.</p>
<p>&quot;There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Hanks then concluded with a few hopeful words, along with a reference to the iconic movie A League of Their Own:</p>
<p><em>We are taking it one-day-at-a-time. There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no? </em></p>
<p><em>Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball.</em></p>
<p>Wilson, meanwhile, also gave thanks, writing:</p>
<p>&quot;So grateful for the outpouring of prayers, love and support. Means so much and strengthens us.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The Coronavirus has been labeled a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>As of this writing, it has led to over 30 deaths in the United States, with many more predicted and with school systems around the country canceling classes for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>All professional sports leagues are also on hiatus, while the NCAA Tournament has been called off completely.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>We&#8217;re in uncharted territory here, folks.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there.</p>

<p>The stars made a joint announcement on Wednesday night, confirming this diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches.</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p><em>Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.</em></p>
<p>The statement then concluded:</p>
<p><em>Well, now. What to do next? </em></p>

<p><em>The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks&rsquo; will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. </em></p>
<p><em>Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?</em></p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves.</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>COVID-19, of course, is now commonly referred to as the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>It has been spreading as a rapid pace in the United States, with President Donald Trump making remarks about emergency measures he plans to take in an address from the Oval Office last night.</p>
<p>Moreover, multiple NBA players have now tested positive and that league has suspended all games indefinitely.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>An endless number of schools and universities have also shut down for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>As for how Hanks and Wilson are holding up?</p>
<p>Their son, Chet Hanks, took to Instagram in the wake of his mother and father&#8217;s confirmation to provide an update for fans.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#8217;s up everyone. Yeah, it&#8217;s true, my parents got coronavirus, crazy. They&#8217;re both down in Australia right now because my dad was shooting a movie down there,&quot; he said.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;But I just got off the phone with them and they both are fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#8217;re not even that sick, they&#8217;re not worried about it, they&#8217;re not tripping, but they&#8217;re going through the necessary health precautions, obviously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s anything to be too worried about.&quot;</p>
<p>Concluded the younger Hanks:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I appreciate everyone&#8217;s concern and the well wishes, but I think it&#8217;s all gonna be alright. I appreciate it and just, everybody, stay safe out there. Much love.&quot;</p>
<p>Chet&#8217;s brother, Colin Hanks, also took to Instagram to thank everyone for the &quot;outpouring of support.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My parents are receiving excellent care in Australia and are doing well (and in good spirits) given the circumstances,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Following this troubling news, a Warner Bros. Pictures spokesperson also released a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus),&quot; it reads.</p>
<p>And it concludes:</p>
<p>&quot;We are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 is currently receiving treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>Be safe, people.</p>

<p>In a message he posted while on vacation in Australia with his wife, Rita Wilson, the beloved actor confirmed the troubling news himself on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, folks,&quot; wrote the two-time Oscar winner, adding in candid detail:</p>
<p>&quot;Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to Deadliine, the famous couple was Down Under for the pre-production of Baz Luhrmann&rsquo;s untitled Elvis Presley film from Warner Bros.</p>
<p>In the movie, the legendary star Hanks portrays Presley&rsquo;s longtime manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, now. What to do next?&quot; continued Hanks in his post.</p>
<p>&quot;The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks&rsquo; will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ll keep the world posted and updated,&quot; concluded the actor. Take care of yourselves!&rdquo; &ndash; Tom Hanks</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Coronavirus is the common name that&#8217;s been given to the disease COVID-19.</p>
<p>It originated in China and has since spread across the globe, with The World Health Organization officially titling is as a &quot;pandemic&quot; on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>In response to Hanks&#8217; shocking admission, Warner Bros. has released a statement of its own.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It reads:</p>
<p><em>We have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus).</em></p>
<p><em>We are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>The health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world.</em></p>
<p><em>The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 is currently receiving treatment.</em></p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The news of Hanks&#8217; diagnosis broke almost as soon as President Donald Trump concluded remarks he made to a national TV audience from the Oval Offiice.</p>
<p>In these remarks, the President said America is suspending all travel from Europe for the next 30 days, while also calling on Congress to pass various forms of legislation that could stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been in frequent contact with our allies and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people,&quot; Trump said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Added the Commander-in-Chief:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we&#8217;ll ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.</p>
<p>&quot;From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges including large scale and very dangerous health threats.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The outbreak of the&nbsp;Coronavirus in the United States has prompted numerous colleges and schools to suspend classes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the NBA just suspended its season after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the disease.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented situation that has the entire world on edge. No one really knows what will happen next.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Wilson, meanwhile, is a very accomplished actress in her own right.</p>
<p>She played an extended role on the HBO series Girls and also the Good Wife and appeared in such movies as Larry Crowne, It&#8217;s Complicated and Old Dogs.</p>
<p>Wilson and Hanks got married in April of 1988.</p>

<p>For the record,&nbsp; the CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.</p>
<p>Symptoms include a fever, cough and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>And everyone out there should be extra cautious about traveling and gathering in large groups of any kind.</p>
<p>For now, we send our very best wishes to Hanks, Wilson and everyone affected by this outbreak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>According to a recent tabloid cover story,&nbsp;Tom Hanks is about to get divorced.</p>
<p>But does this mean the actor is down on the concept of marriage in general?</p>
<p>Nope. Not at all.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re not just saying this because the <a href="/2016/09/tom-hanks-and-rita-wilson-the-next-couple-to-split/">Tom Hanks-Rita Wilson divorce story</a> is clearly ridiculous.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;re saying it because photographer Meg Miller was snapping portraits of a new bride and groom in New York City&#8217;s Central Park over the weekend when she tells The Huffington Post that she put her camera down to let &quot;this guy&quot; pass.</p>
<p>But &quot;this guy&quot; did not turn out to be your regular jogger.</p>
<p>He turned out to be Tom Hanks!</p>
<p>Yes, <em>that</em> Tom Hanks!</p>
<p>Moreover, instead of just running on by and continuing with his day, the two-time Oscar winner approached the newlyweds, Elisabeth and Ryan, &ldquo;took off his hat, just leaned right into the group and said &lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Tom Hanks,&rsquo;&rdquo; Miller explains.</p>
<p>According to Miller, Hanks proceeded to shake hands&#8230; give the bride a peck&#8230;. and give the couple his best wishes.</p>
<p>Oh, and he even offered to officiate their wedding because he&#8217;s an ordained minister.</p>
<p>HA!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After posing for a selfie with the couple, which he later posted on his own Instagram accoint, Hanks just &ldquo;sort of took off running,&rdquo; Miller said. &ldquo;Had he just run past us we would have never known it was him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what makes this story so great.</p>
<p>It would be one thing if Hanks was recognized and <em>then</em> agreed to take part in a couple photos.</p>
<p>But to go so far out of his way like this?</p>
<p>Talk about a BIG gesture from a BIG-hearted celebrity on such a BIG occasion, huh?</p>
<p>(Get it? Because Tom Hanks rose to fame in the movie <em>Big</em>.)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Elizabeth and Ryan! Congrats and blessings! Hanx,&quot; the actor wrote as a caption to the image he shared on social media.</p>
<p>Does he really refer to himself as <em>Hanx</em>? Man, the guy keeps getting awesomer and&nbsp;awesomer.</p>

Are you ready?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>According to a new report, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson just might be<a href="/slideshows/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-romance-timeline/"> following in Brangelina&#8217;s footsteps</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yep, we&#8217;re talking about a potential divorce here. Heaven help us all.</p>
<p>Pull yourself together, as your heart just surely shattered into a billion little pieces, and now let&#8217;s review the details of this couple&#8217;s alleged struggles.</p>
<p>Star <a href="http://starmagazine.com/2016/09/23/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-divorce-marriage-problems-rumors/">reports</a> that Tom and Rita had &quot;a major blowout fight&quot; last month, one that &quot;caused Rita to storm out.&quot; It was apparently a long time coming though &#8212; the report also claims that tensions have been high for a while now.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="841" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-841x1024.jpg" alt="Tom Hanks Rita Wilson pic" class="wp-image-241738" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-841x1024.jpg 841w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-246x300.jpg 246w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-768x935.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-735x895.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-275x335.jpg 275w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-285x347.jpg 285w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-427x520.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-525x640.jpg 525w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-631x768.jpg 631w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-788x960.jpg 788w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic-887x1080.jpg 887w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-pic.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>One of the couple&#8217;s big issues is purportedly Tom&#8217;s extremely successful career.</p>
<p>&quot;Tom&#8217;s been going straight from one set to another,&quot; a source claims. &quot;It wasn&#8217;t easy for him to hide his pain while filming &#8216;Sully,&#8217; but nonstop working is a kind of escape for him.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it gets unbearably sad though.</p>
<p>&quot;When Rita confronts him about it,&quot; the source adds, &quot;he promises he&#8217;ll slow down, but he never does. They&#8217;re caught in a vicious cycle.&quot;</p>

<p>Another issue is said to be the couple&#8217; son, Chet Hanks, and his <a href="/2015/06/chet-haze-trashes-hotel-room-in-tantrum-over-lack-of-drugs-women/">ongoing issues with substance abuse</a>.</p>
<p>These past few years have been hard ones for Chet &#8212;<a href="/2014/11/chet-haze-tom-hanks-rapper-son-checks-into-rehab-for-cocaine-add/"> he went to rehab in 2014</a>, then in 2015 he <a href="/2015/08/chet-haze-tom-hanks-son-reported-missing/">mysteriously disappeared for several weeks</a>. It couldn&#8217;t have been easy for Tom and Rita to deal with all that.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t: according to this source, Rita &quot;thinks Tom is too easy&quot; on Chet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Tom can be heavy-handed and overbearing with Rita,&quot; the source reveals, &quot;but he&#8217;s the complete opposite with his son. Rita takes a tough-love approach.&quot;</p>
<p>And, tragically, &quot;in some ways she blames Tom for Chet&#8217;s problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Hopefully, if there&#8217;s even the tiniest bit of truth in this, Tom and Rita can sort out their problems instead of going the same way as Brad and Angelina went before them.</p>

<p>After all, they&#8217;ve been married for 28 years now, and they&#8217;re pretty much the picture of true love and happiness, at least in Hollywood. If they split up, that would be the final nail in love&#8217;s coffin.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t take this, not with everything else that&#8217;s happened this week. We have to have something to believe in.</p>
<p>Tom, Rita, don&#8217;t you do this to us. Don&#8217;t you even dare.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Haze is usually active on Instagram but announced in July that he planned to stop posting on the site, following a controversy over his repeated <a href="/2015/06/chet-haze-deletes-instagram-in-wake-of-n-word-controversy/">use of the N-word</a>.</p>
<p>Haze&#8217;s last message, posted on July 23, reads, &quot;I&#8217;m not gonna be on Instagram for a while&#8230;Getting the f&#8211;k out of Dodge for a minute&#8230;Gonna go get my mind right. I&#8217;ll be back!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, Radar Online is reporting that <a href="http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/tom-hanks-son-chet-haze-missing-drug-fears/?utm_source=MediaVine&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TrafficExchange_August">Haze has had no&nbsp;contact with his family or friends </a>in the five weeks since, and his parents have hired private investigators in a desperate attempt to track him down.</p>
<p>Insiders say the family has not involved the police, as they hope to &quot;keep the development out of the press.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="/2014/11/chet-haze-tom-hanks-rapper-son-checks-into-rehab-for-cocaine-add/">Chet checked into rehab</a>&nbsp;to be treated for a cocaine addiction last year, and his family reportedly fears he may have relapsed.</p>
<p>Particularly worrisome is the fact that investigators have tracked Chet&#8217;s cell phone to Barstow, a desert town commonly described as &quot;the meth capital of California.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of Chet messing with that stuff,&rdquo; says one source, adding that the family regards the possibility of Chet using meth as &quot;a worst case scenario.&quot;</p>
