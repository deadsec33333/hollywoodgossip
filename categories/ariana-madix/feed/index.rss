<p>Earlier this week, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> fans were stunned by the news that the entire cast will be replaced by newcomers when the show returns for its twelfth season next year.</p>



<p>And it seems that viewers of the long-running Bravo series weren&#8217;t the only ones who were caught off guard.</p>



<p>Insiders say <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/vanderpump-rules-reboot-confirmed-by-bravo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the OGs of Vanderpump were blindsided</a> by the news that the show would be moving on without them.</p>

<p>&#8216;</p>



<p>According to one source, the cast was not consulted before VPR executive producers (including the show&#8217;s namesake, Lisa Vanderpump) made the decision to reboot with an entirely new cast.</p>



<p>“The cast members were left in the dark for months about the plans for season 12,” the insider tells <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/pump-rules-stars-were-left-in-the-dark-about-new-season-12-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>.</p>



<p>Another source says that the decision was made for entirely &#8220;creative&#8221; reasons and was not a result of budget constraints.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1941411511-840x1024.jpg" alt="Tom Schwartz attends the premiere party for Season 11 of Bravo's &quot;Vanderpump Rules&quot; at the Hollywood Palladium on January 17, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

<p></p>



<p>“There weren’t any negotiations happening between the cast and the network where money was even discussed,” a source told <em><a href="https://people.com/the-real-reason-behind-vanderpump-rules-cast-shakeup-exclusive-8752430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-beginning-of-the-end">The Beginning of the End</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/vanderpump-rules-canceled-by-bravo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Production on <em>Vanderpump</em> was paused</a> earlier this year so that producers could decide on the show&#8217;s new direction.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/tom-sandoval-tries-to-justify-george-floyd-remarks-on-vanderpump-rules-reunion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Scandoval&#8221;</a> of 2023 had led to a resurgence in popularity, but the show began to show signs of age again in its tenth season.</p>



<p>Fans grew tired of the cast rehashing the same drama. And when the show didn&#8217;t film over the summer, Bravo execs claimed the delay was designed to give the cast time to move on.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1365399008-1-1024x683.jpg" alt='Tom Sandoval and Lala Kent attend the "Vanderpump Rules" Party For LALA Beauty Hosted By Lala Kent at Beauty &amp; Essex on June 30, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>But apparently, moving on proved to be impossible.</p>





<p>“There had been a long pause in production, and nothing had really changed among the cast since the reunion,” the insider explained. </p>



<p>“Everyone was still stuck in their feelings and refusing to bend.”</p>



<p>When months continued to pass with no plan to resume production, the cast reportedly began to see the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>“No one was necessarily surprised … it’s all coming to an end,” the source said. “It’s more relief that they finally have an answer.”</p>



<p><em>People</em>&#8216;s insider noted that “the group ties to SUR and Lisa [Vanderpump] were practically non-existent” by that point.</p>



<p>“It just didn’t make sense to continue. This is an attempt to recalibrate and bring the show back to the thing that made it such a success to begin with,&#8221; added the source.</p>

<p>While fans are sure to miss the antics of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/lala-kent/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lala Kent</a>, Scheana Shay, Ariana Madix, and the Toms (okay, maybe they won&#8217;t miss the Toms), Bravo execs say they&#8217;re excited to move forward with a “new group of close-knit SUR-vers.”</p>



<p>“It’s a fresh start, and the players they have are interested and motivated to participate. Fans will be happy with what they see. It’s going to feel like a return to form,&#8221; says the insider.</p>



<p>“The last 12 years of filming have been an extraordinary run full of laughter, tears, and everything in between,” added Lisa in a statement. </p>



<p>“I can’t thank enough those who have shared their lives. How I love you all. In the restaurant business, one shift always gives way to another. Cheers to the next generation of Vanderpump Rules.”</p>



<p>Recapturing the magic of Vanderpump&#8217;s heyday won&#8217;t be easy. But we&#8217;ll certainly tune in to watch the new crew give it a shot.</p>

<p>Jeremy Madix, the brother of former <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/vanderpump-rules/">Vanderpump Rules</a> star Ariana Madix, was arrested at his home in Oceanside, California back on July 10 and extradited to Orange County, Florida.</p>



<p>According to legal documents obtained by various <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/">celebrity gossip</a> outlets, Madix was charged with one count of trafficking in cannabis over 25 pounds stemming from an incident that took place on February 16.</p>

<p>The arrest warrant alleges that Jeremy and a friend named Jonah Ahad were traveling together from Orlando International Airport to Frankfurt, Germany when Customs and Border Protection agents inspected two bags belonging to Jeremy and one belonging to Ahad.</p>



<p><strong>In Jeremy’s suitcases, he was <strong>apparently</strong></strong> <strong>carrying 64 vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana, which weighed approximately 76 pounds</strong>. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s just a crazy amount of weed.</p>



<p>Madix was initially held without bail, but a judge eventually set this figure at $80,000 and he has since been released. </p>



<p>The reality star had to surrender his passport within five days of release to the clerk’s office.</p>

<p>Madix faces a minimum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of $25,000.</p>



<p>In the time since his arrest, Jeremy&#8217;s mother, Tanya Madix, has written a letter in support of her son, telling the judge overseeing the case that the 32-year-old is &#8220;is a wonderful loving son&#8221; and a &#8220;kind person.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been no word from sister Ariana, however.</p>



<p>This is because the siblings are not close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obviously, I’m always going to stand by my sister,&#8221; Jeremy said in March on the PUMP RULES Podcast , referencing Ariana&#8217;s infamous split from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/tom-sandoval/">Tom Sandoval</a> after his affair with Raquel Leviss. </p>



<p>&#8220;But yeah, I need to talk to Tom. I would love to talk to my sister, but I haven’t heard from her in months.&#8221;</p>



<p>He previously told Us Weekly that the estrangement stems from how Ariana does NOT get along with Jeremy&#8217;s fiance.</p>



<p>“There’s been some small microaggressive gestures toward my fiancée, and that’s what’s led to me not talking to my sister. It’s been going on for quite some time,” he told this tabloid months ago. </p>



<p>“I think that we’ve just been kind of letting it pass, because of course I’m always going to have my sister’s back. But I was put in a position where I choose my sister, or do I choose the person I’m going to spend the rest of my life with?”</p>

<p>The Tom-Ariana breakup was already quite messy. And now there&#8217;s a chance that the exes might wind up squaring off in court.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know so far:</p>

<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/17/entertainment/tom-sandoval-sues-ariana-madix-for-accessing-explicit-raquel-leviss-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>, Sandoval filed a suit in which he accused Ariana of “obtain[ing] access” to explicit videos of Leviss from his phone without “authorization or permission.”</p>



<p>He says she then created “copies” of the footage and “distributed” them to “Leviss and third parties.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-claps-back">Ariana Claps Back</h2>



<p>Ariana&#8217;s lawyer, Jordan Susman, called Sandoval’s lawsuit an “abhorrent” attempt to “torture” her and “shirk responsibility for the effects of his actions” in a statement issued to <em>Us</em>.</p>

<p>“Ms. Madix is confident that a jury will see through this latest ploy and dismiss his frivolous claims,” the attorney told <em>Us Weekly.</em></p>



<p>Sandoval&#8217;s attorney, Matthew Geragos, insisted that the move from Sandoval was a &#8220;customary&#8221; one carried out with the goal of protecting his own best interests.</p>



<p>“This customary legal action was crucial to ensure that liability, if any, is fairly distributed based on the actual level of involvement and fault of each party,&#8221; the lawyer said this week.</p>

<p>&#8220;We aim to resolve this legal dispute with utmost respect towards all parties involved.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-act-of-revenge">An Act of Revenge?</h2>



<p>In previous comments on the case, Ariana&#8217;s legal team alleged that Rachel&#8217;s suit was purely punitive.</p>



<p>They claimed it was filed with no intention other than exacting revenge against those who she felt had wronged her.</p>



<p>In court documents obtained by <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/29/entertainment/ariana-madix-accuses-raquel-leviss-of-trying-to-punish-her-with-revenge-porn-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, Ariana’s lawyers allege that Raquel “seeks to punish” and “blame Ms. Madix for the negative reaction [Leviss] received as a result of her affair with” Sandoval.</p>



<p>The lawyers allege that Raquel’s lawsuit is “an abuse of the legal process.” They add that it “does not seek to vindicate any cognizable rights.&#8221;</p>



<p>Instead, they claim, Rachel is attempting to limit Ariana’s right to free speech.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-all-began">How It All Began</h2>



<p>The infamous <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/ariana-madix-joins-dancing-with-the-stars-launches-acting-career-in-wake-of-scandoval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scandoval</a> began when Ariana discovered the explicit footage on Tom&#8217;s phone.</p>



<p>The  controversy boosted the show&#8217;s ratings, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/lala-kent-blasts-raquel-leviss-shes-a-coward-for-running-from-tom-sandoval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel chose not to return for <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> Season 11</a>.</p>



<p>Predictably, interest in the show has plummeted as a result.</p>



<p>Now, it looks as though the scandals&#8217; final chapter will play out in court. </p>



<p>And Rachel is once again poised to have the last laugh.</p>

<p>So&#8230; <em>THAT</em> happened on Tuesday night.</p>



<p>Amid concern that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/vanderpump-rules-canceled-by-bravo/">Vanderpump Rules will be canceled</a> because the beloved series is not scheduled to film at all this summer, Bravo aired a Season 11 episode titled &#8220;Plot Twist.&#8221;</p>



<p>Toward the end of the installment, a producer stated &#8220;that&#8217;s the end,&#8221; causing many to stop, ask and wonder:</p>



<p>Wait, was is the <em><strong>end</strong></em> end?!? Was it the series finale?!?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vanderpump-rules-recap-tom-and-ariana-s-standoff">&#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217; Recap: Tom and Ariana&#8217;s Standoff </h2>



<p>On the episode itself, Tom Sandoval was irate because Ariana Madix claimed his apologies &#8212; for having <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/tom-sandoval-comes-clean-i-cheated-on-ariana-madix-with-several-women/">cheated on her with Rachel Leviss</a> &#8212; were merely &#8220;performative.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is f&#8211;king bullst,&#8221; Sandoval fumed on air. </p>



<p>&#8220;Ariana&#8217;s just going around saying I&#8217;m not being honest, that I&#8217;m performative. Do you know what it is? Ariana is f&#8211;king performative. She doesn&#8217;t like any of these motherf&#8211;kers. So she can f&#8211;k off saying I&#8217;m performative.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ariana, meanwhile, told viewers: </p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s never tried to talk to me off camera. He could&#8217;ve written something in a f&#8211;king letter and left it on my kitchen counter and I could&#8217;ve read it at my leisure. But if you would only do it on camera, to me you just showed your true colors.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lala-kent-breaks-her-silence-and-defends-tom">Lala Kent Breaks Her Silence and&#8230; Defends Tom?!</h2>



<p>For her part, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/lala-kent/">Lala Kent</a> grew sick of Madix bringing up this topic so often&#8230; even though the affair with Leviss was exposed just three months before Season 11 started shooting.</p>



<p>&#8220;I get it! He f&#8211;king cheated! You did a really f&#8211;king stty thing! It was weird how you looked us all in the eye and said a lot of sh-t,&#8221; Lala said. </p>



<p>&#8220;But he did not kill somebody! She moved on eight days later! Eight days! I&#8217;ve never in my life experienced someone who gets cheated on and suddenly she becomes God. Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kent even blasted Madix for not showing her &#8220;low lows&#8221; to the rest of the cast, sounding bitter that Ariana was never &#8220;honest&#8221; with her feeling in her view.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fate-of-vanderpump-rules-after-the-finale">The Fate of Vanderpump Rules After The Finale</h2>



<p>In the wake of the drama, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> is taking a production pause ahead of season 12, but it <em>does</em> sound as if there will be a Season 12.</p>



<p>Probably.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a possibility of a cast shakeup, or having the legacy cast members move to The Valley, but no decisions have been made yet,&#8221; a source has told Entertainment Tonight.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Madix will be hosting Love Island and, in August, will make her return to Broadway&#8230; while Lisa Vanderpump likely will be filming a second season of Hulu&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/vanderpump-villa-hulu-spinoff-details-cast-location-premiere-date/">Vanderpump Villa</a>.</p>



<p>Will they even want to continue with Vanderpump Rules?!?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="686" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-686x1024.jpg" alt="Sandoval, Tom" class="wp-image-499465" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-686x1024.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-201x300.jpg 201w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-768x1147.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-1372x2048.jpg 1372w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-643x960.jpg 643w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-723x1080.jpg 723w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-804x1200.jpg 804w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1941411482-scaled.jpg 1715w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tom Sandoval attends the premiere party for Season 11 of Bravo&#8217;s &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; at the Hollywood Palladium on January 17, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Also looking ahead, Vanderpump Rules will kick off its three-part reunion on May 14, with subsequent episodes airing May 21 and May 28. </p>



<p>The official synopsis for the final part reads as follows:</p>



<p><strong>The reunion comes to a stunning close when, for the first time, the cast watches the last minutes of the finale live on stage. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Ariana breaks her no contact rule with Sandoval, leaving both in tears. Scheana defends her actions and suggests her rift with Ariana started well before this summer. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Katie blames Sandoval for the downfall of her relationship with Schwartz. Lala doubles down on the comments she made during the season, leaving her friendships on life support</strong>.</p>

<p>Ariana found out about the affair when she caught sight of some incriminating footage on Sandoval&#8217;s phone.</p>



<p>Raquel is now accusing the former couple of revenge porn, intentional infliction of emotional distress, eavesdropping, and invasion of privacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-madix-claps-back-at-raquel-leviss">Ariana Madix Claps Back at Raquel Leviss</h2>



<p>But in new court documents obtained by <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/29/entertainment/ariana-madix-accuses-raquel-leviss-of-trying-to-punish-her-with-revenge-porn-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, Ariana&#8217;s lawyers allege that Raquel “seeks to punish” and “blame Ms. Madix for the negative reaction [Leviss] received as a result of her affair with” Sandoval.</p>

<p>The documents allege that Raquel&#8217;s lawsuit is “an abuse of the legal process” and “does not seek<br>to vindicate any cognizable rights” but instead attempts to limit Ariana&#8217;s right to free speech.</p>



<p>Ariana&#8217;s lawyers claim that she was “devastated and immediately confronted” Sandoval about his affair.</p>



<p>She then sent Leviss a text that read, “you’re dead to me,” along with the video.</p>



<p>The attorneys note, however, that that was the only time that Ariana shared the footage with anyone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-tells-her-side-of-the-story">Ariana Tells Her Side of the Story</h2>



<p>In a court filing, Ariana says she didn’t “share or show any of the video footage she found” because Sandoval deleted it off her phone during their subsequent argument.</p>



<p>“I did not send the videos to anyone else … I only saw the video of [Leviss] masturbating in places secluded from others — alone in the bathroom stall and in the alley with Mr. Sandoval,&#8221; Leviss writes.</p>



<p>“A heated argument ensued between me and Mr. Sandoval, and Mr. Sandoval forcibly grabbed my phone from my hands, causing my credit cards and driver’s license to fall to the pavement,” she continues.</p>



<p>“I quickly grabbed my cards off the pavement and chased after Mr. Sandoval, who had further distanced himself from the club. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;By the time I caught up to him, Mr. Sandoval had deleted from my phone the videos I had recorded of the Facetime video.”</p>



<p>Leviss claims that Sandoval recorded her without her knowledge, but Tom&#8217;s lawyers insist that <em>she</em> created the footage in question and sent it to his phone.</p>



<p>“Based on Leviss’ own allegations, Sandoval merely saved private copies of the videos that Leviss had filmed and shared with him,” the filing reads.</p>

<p>“Sandoval’s response in the face of irrefutable evidence that will be presented in court is disturbing,&#8221; Raquel&#8217;s lawyers responded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Leveraging such claims for media attention and perpetuating victim-blaming is not just deplorable but actionable.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still unclear if this case will go to court, but it seems obvious that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/lala-kent-accuses-tom-sandoval-of-grooming-raquel-leviss-in-shocking-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Scandoval</a> is far from over!</p>

<p>At least that&#8217;s the claim Ariana made on last night&#8217;s episode of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>Throughout the show&#8217;s current season, the cast has been attempting to arrange peaceful group gatherings involving both Tom and Ariana.</p>



<p>This turns out to be a mistake literally every time, but the conflict makes for good TV, so these outings probably won&#8217;t be coming to an end anytime soon.</p>

<p>When a trip to the beach turned ugly during Tuesday&#8217;s episode, Sandoval and his longtime bestie Tom Schwartz retreated from the scene.&#8217;</p>



<p>But the conflict continued as Brock Davies accused Ariana of &#8220;castrating&#8221; Sandoval with her comments.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s literally throwing jabs at me, he&#8217;s not castrated,&#8221; Madix clapped back. </p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m allowed to f&#8211;king feel a certain way because he did s&#8211;t to me. I never did anything to him,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to say s&#8211;t to me. I want him to jump into the f&#8211;king ocean. I did not do anything to him, period.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yeah, needless to say, Ariana is not a fan of her ex. In fact, she went on to accuse him of trying to ruin her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man not only tried to ruin me, but now he&#8217;s saying everything he possibly can to make me feel like a horrible partner,&#8221; Ariana said in a confessional.</p>



<p>The remark comes on the heels of last week&#8217;s clash, during which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/ariana-madix-accuses-tom-sandoval-of-attempting-to-murder-her-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana accused Tom of trying to murder her dog</a>.</p>



<p>That may have been a bit of an exaggeration, but Madix <em>was</em> forced to shell out for an expensive procedure after the dog devoured a wooden skewer due to Sandoval&#8217;s negligence.</p>

<p>While she referred to the place as her &#8220;dream home&#8221; during last night&#8217;s episode, it seems that Ariana has conceded and allowed Sandoval to keep the house.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/why-ariana-madix-still-lives-with-tom-sandoval-after-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana has now purchased a place of her own</a>, and we&#8217;re sure she can&#8217;t wait to move out.</p>

<p>Of course, Sandoval believes she&#8217;ll struggle in her own home, as she rarely purchased household essentials during the years they lived together.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gonna be in for a very rude awakening,&#8221; he remarked last night.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Sandoval is usually wrong about most things.</p>



<p>Something tells us that Ariana will manage just fine once she puts some distance between herself and her toxic ex.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://toofab.com/2024/04/02/ariana-madix-tom-sandoval-fight-vanderpump-rules-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scandoval</a> achieved a new level of insanity on Tuesday night when Ariana Madix accused Tom Sandoval of attempting to murder her dog on a new episode of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>The allegation came about during a water-tasting party gone awry.</p>



<p>Yeah, needless to say, this show has taken some turns for the weird this season.</p>



<p>Anyway, after the water sommelier packed up his expensive agua and the cast was enjoying some Little Caesar&#8217;s in James Kennedy and Ally Lewber&#8217;s kitchen, Ariana referred to Tom as an &#8220;attempted dog-murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said it loudly enough for him to hear, and she got the reaction she was looking for.</p>



<p>Now, far be it from us to defend Tom Sandoval, who is obviously not a good dude, but the dog murderer allegation was a little over the top.</p>



<p>For starters, the dog in question is thankfully still alive.</p>



<p>On top of that, the worst that Tom could be accused of is neglect and being a bad roommate.</p>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/why-ariana-madix-still-lives-with-tom-sandoval-after-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom and Ariana still live together</a> despite enduring one of the worst breakups in reality TV history, but thankfully it looks as though the arrangement will soon come to an end. More on that later.</p>

<p>The story with the dog was that Ariana had left some chicken skewers on a nightstand by her bed, and Tom let the pooch into her bedroom while she wasn&#8217;t home.</p>



<p>Pupper got into the takeout leftovers, as dogs will, and he ate the wooden skewers along with the satay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You went into my room with the door closed, do not ever f&#8211;king do that again,&#8221; Ariana shouted at Tom, who then rather lamely accused her of failing to empty her cat&#8217;s litter box.</p>



<p>&#8220;You wanna come back at me about the litter box when you almost f&#8211;king killed my dog?&#8221; she shot back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do not go in my room. That is the only safe space I have in that home because you f&#8211;king wrecked it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tom-vs-ariana-round-2">Tom vs. Ariana: Round 2</h2>



<p>Tom rather wisely decided to leave the fancy water party at that point.</p>



<p>But later in the episode, he showed up at a group beach outing, where Ariana went off him yet again.</p>



<p>This encounter wasn&#8217;t quite as ugly as the first (for starters, there were no new allegations of animal abuse), but it still made for a pretty awkward situation for the bystanders.</p>

<p>We respect that this group of friends has decided to try and remain united in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/lala-kent-accuses-tom-sandoval-of-grooming-raquel-leviss-in-shocking-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom&#8217;s affair with Raquel Leviss</a>, but it might be time to admit that it&#8217;s not really working.</p>



<p>But hey, we have some good news to report, as <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/03/24/lifestyle/ariana-madix-buys-1-6m-home-in-la-after-post-split-real-estate-battle-with-ex-tom-sandoval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana recently bought a house</a> in the Hollywood Hills and will soon be moving out of the home she shares with Tom.</p>



<p>Perhaps then the healing can begin.</p>



<p>Yeah, probably not, but at least her pets will be safer!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about to go down on Vanderpump Rules.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Bravo released a midseason trailer for upcoming episodes of the explosive reality show&#8230; which is more or less based entirely around Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix at this point.</p>



<p>The co-stars dated for many years, of course, only to break up in 2023 after it came out that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/tom-sandoval-banged-raquel-leviss-in-arianas-bed-while-she-was-at-her-grandmothers-funeral/">Sandoval had cheated on Madix</a> with good friend Raquel Leviss.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/raquel-leviss-refusing-to-return-to-vanderpump-rules-without-a-big-post-scandoval-raise/">Leviss has chosen NOT to return to the show</a>&#8230; while Sandoval and Madix remain key cast members.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-2.02.26%E2%80%AFPM-1024x622.png" alt="Ariana Madix versus Tom Sandoval" class="wp-image-495560"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Madix storms away from Tom Sandoval in this Vanderpump Rules scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For most of this season, however, Madix and Sandoval have avoided one another.</p>



<p>The aforementioned preview, however, features Tom Schwartz defending his BFF at some sort of fancy gathering by saying Sandoval isn&#8217;t &#8220;a trash person,&#8221; but &#8220;a good person who did a trash thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>At this same event, Madix&#8217;s boyfriend, Daniel Way, makes his first in-person appearance on Vanderpump Rules &#8212; and actually speaks to Sandoval at one point.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t hear any of their conversation in the teaser, though.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-2.02.30%E2%80%AFPM-1024x673.png" alt="Ariana Madix speaks to a producer" class="wp-image-495561"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Madix speaks to a producer in this scene from Vanderpump Rules.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here is where the good stuff comes in, meanwhile:</p>



<p>Madix is at this same black tie party and we see her storming away from Sandoval toward the end of the footage&#8230; before complaining to either an event organizer or maybe a producer for the program, saying on air:</p>



<p>&#8220;He wants 30 seconds with the audience. He doesn&#8217;t give a f-ck if I f-cking died in a ditch.&#8221; </p>



<p>Sandoval then retaliates by telling the rest of the cast: &#8220;Ariana, she f-cking talks sh-t about all you f-ckers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lovely, huh?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the trailer, Katie Maloney hurls shade at Sandoval for constant crying, while Madix tells her sleazy ex &#8220;don&#8217;t speak to me&#8221; after he attempts to initiate a conversation during a group beach outing. </p>



<p>Sandoval is also seen confronting Jax Taylor for talking &#8220;sh-t&#8221; about him in the press &#8212; with the former costar responding in hilarious manner.</p>



<p>He just tells Sandoval that everyone is talking crap about him.</p>



<p>The guy better get used to it.</p>

<p>Finally, viewers can also look forward to a lot more tension between Scheana Shay and Sandoval, along with discussions about babies between James Kennedy and Ally Lewber &#8230; AND marriage drama for Scheana and Brock Davies.</p>



<p>In cryptic fashion, for example, Shay is seen telling him: </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you and I are going to be together forever.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Vanderpump Rules airs Tuesday nights at 8/7c on Bravo.</strong></p>

<p>Ariana Madix claims she was nearly broke in the weeks before she learned that her then-boyfriend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/tom-sandoval-to-ariana-madix-get-a-life-leave-me-the-heck-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Sandoval, was cheating on her</a>.</p>



<p>The news comes as a shock to <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> fans, many of whom assumed that Ariana had been raking in the dough throughout her time on the popular Bravo series.</p>



<p>And while she <em>has</em> been making good money the past couple of seasons, it seems that that&#8217;s a pretty new development.</p>



<p>And it coincided with a very expensive time in Ariana&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>Tonight&#8217;s episode of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>, features a scene in which Ariana opens up to her friends about her living situation (she still shares a home with Sandoval) and her finances.</p>



<p>“The internet thinks I’ve made millions of dollars, that is not true, and it’s like, on March 1, was I financially prepared to move? No,” Ariana says in a <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/vanderpump-rules/season-11/videos/ariana-madix-admits-shes-scrambling-to-get-her-sht-together" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview clip</a> posted by Bravo. </p>



<p>“Literally the week before all of this happened, I remember emailing my agent and my manager and being like, ‘Guys, let’s start, like, really trying to, like, do some s&#8211;t because I am not in a good place financially.</p>

<p>“When I first started making, like, decent money, we decided we wanted to buy a house, and then I was playing catch-up all the way up until Katie and I found a great location for our sandwich shop, then a bunch of my money went toward that, and now I was at a point where in March I was literally on, like, my last $2,000,&#8221; Ariana revealed.</p>



<p>The sandwich shop she co-owns with Katie Maloney still isn&#8217;t open for business, but Ariana&#8217;s financial situation has done a complete 180 in the past year.</p>



<p>In fact, these days, she&#8217;s got more work than she can handle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-madix-broke-no-more">Ariana Madix: Broke No More!</h2>



<p>In the months after news of Sandoval&#8217;s affair came out, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ariana-madix-joins-dancing-with-the-stars-season-32/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana booked <em>Dancing With the Stars</em></a> and the lead role in <em>Chicago</em> on Broadway.</p>



<p>She also signed endorsement deals with Uber Eats, Bic, T-Mobile, and Glad trash bags.</p>



<p>(That last one seems sort of random until you remember who Ariana&#8217;s ex is.)</p>

<p>Sandoval, of course, has thrown his fair share of shade by making remarks about how Ariana won &#8220;the breakup lottery.&#8221;</p>



<p>But as she pointed out in a recent interview with the <em>LA Times</em>, she works in the entertainment industry, and she&#8217;s making the best of a bad situation.</p>



<p>“I think those people are confused about what it is that I do for a living,” she told the outlet (via <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/03/11/ariana-madix-talks-about-her-pre-scandoval-finances-on-this-weeks-vanderpump-rules-i-was-literally-on-my-last-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>). </p>

<p>“Those are acting jobs. I’m doing the same job I have done for many years; I’m just working more,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;And that’s why I signed up for <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> in the first place — to work more.”</p>



<p>And as a bonus, Ariana&#8217;s pain helped to keep all of her friends on Vanderpump employed for another season.</p>



<p>Sandoval and everyone else on that cast should be thanking her.</p>

<p><strong>How Tom Sandoval Became the Most Hated Man In America</strong></p>



<p><strong>B</strong></p>



<p>Moving on, in the interview, Tom drops some pretty wild soundbites. At one point, he ever likens the sensationalism of Scandoval to George Floyd&#8217;s murder, which is just&#8230; not ok.</p>



<p>But speaking on his affair, Tom went into detail about what happened the night Ariana Madix found out about his<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/raquel-leviss-hints-tom-sandoval-orchestrated-affair-for-vanderpump-ratings-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> affair with Raquel Leviss</a>. </p>



<p>It did not go well. </p>

<p>While giving the reporter at NYT a tour of Tom Tom, he proceeded to show them the alley behind the restaurant.</p>



<p>Between the trash cans and smell of garbage is where Tom says Ariana learned of his betrayal, and things got violent from there.  </p>



<p>“She beat my ass,” he said, accusing his ex of ripping the chain off his neck and even splitting his lip</p>



<p>Now, Ariana has denied tearing his necklace off in the past, so these accusations are not new. But to suggest she &#8220;beat&#8221; him? That&#8217;s serious.</p>



<p>As of now, Ariana has not responded to the accusations, though many outlets have reached out to her for comment.</p>
