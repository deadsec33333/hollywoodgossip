<p>The White Lotus Season 3 came, saw, felt very slow at times, revealed some shocking deaths&#8230; and then shattered some records.</p>



<p>On Sunday night, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-who-lives-who-dies-what-becomes-of-the-wildly-effed-up-ratliff-clan/">third season finale</a> drew 6.2 million viewers, a 30% jump over the previous series high… which was set at 4.8 million viewers just seven days earlier.</p>



<p>Along with the increase from Episode 7, this finale’s audience represented a 51% increase from the Season 2 finale and a 158% increase from the Season 3 premiere.</p>



<p>The show is a legitimate hit.</p>

<p>In case you weren&#8217;t aware, HBO has already given the green light to Season 4, an announcement that immediately prompted speculation from fans across the globe. </p>



<p>The White Lotus has already taken us to Hawaii. And Italy. And most recently Thailand.</p>



<p>Where might we be headed next?</p>



<p>Those who know creator Mike White well have said there&#8217;s no chance he takes the series anywhere cold; he just doesn&#8217;t like that type of environment.</p>

<p>“For the fourth season, I want to get a little bit out of the crashing waves of rocks vernacular but there’s always more room for more murders at the White Lotus hotels,” <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-mike-white-teases-location-season-4-1236361757/">White said at the end </a>of Season 3 in an interview with Deadline.</p>



<p>This same outlet reported earlier this year that the HBO drama was considering a Four Seasons hotel in Europe for its impending season. </p>



<p>A source added that back then, however, that “everything is on the table for next season” and that no decision has been made.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, HBO Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi has also teased where Season 4 may take place in a chat with Deadline in February.</p>



<p>“We’re going on some locations scouting in the next couple of weeks, so we’ll know soon,” Orsi said. “I can’t really say where we’re going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”</p>

<p>According to Deadline insiders, any scouting trip for the next location has been pushed to summer because White needs a little break after Season 3.</p>



<p>The guy writes every episode. He has certainly earned it.</p>



<p>For those wondering, The Four Seasons chain and HBO formalized their partnership before Season 3 aired, meaning it’s increasingly likely Season 4 will <em>also</em> use a branch of the resort.</p>



<p>The luxury resort’s European locations include London, Paris, Geneva, Budapest, Athens, Madrid and Portugal. Just something to think about it and wonder about.</p>



<p>Early on in Season 3, Executive Producer David Bernad old The New York Post about future episodes: “We haven’t gotten to it yet,&#8221; adding:</p>



<p>“There’s a macro approach, which is ‘what’s a country that has a film community or local crew that also has a tax rebate that’s film friendly?’ We start in a broader sense, and each season has a larger theme.”</p>

<p>Well, another season of the <em>White Lotus</em> is almost at an end.</p>



<p>And as usual, we have a whole lot of lingering questions as we head into the highly anticipated season finale.</p>



<p>As you may be aware, viewers are somewhat divided in terms of the overall quality of the series&#8217; trip to Thailand.</p>



<p>Some have hailed it as the most compelling season yet, while others have complained that the pacing has been a bit too sluggish.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Walton Goggins appears on an episode of the White Lotus Season 3." class="wp-image-522811" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-728x410.jpeg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-960x540.jpeg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-1080x608.jpeg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_2.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Walton Goggins appears on an episode of the White Lotus Season 3.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Max)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But whether you loved the latest episodes or thought there was room for improvement, we&#8217;re sure you have high hopes heading into Sunday night&#8217;s big finale.</p>



<p>We know that gunfire will ring out in the finale, and in keeping with the trend set by the first two seasons, a major character will probably leave the resort in a body bag.</p>



<p>But how will it go down? And what will be the circumstances?</p>



<p>Join us as we delve into those and other big questions that have us reaching for the lorazepam ahead of the final episode of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/the-white-lotus-season-3-where-to-next-and-who-might-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The White Lotus</em> Season 3</a>.</p>

<p>Rick&#8217;s long-suffering girlfriend Chelsea has been through a lot this season, what with being bitten by a snake and nearly shot in a robbery.</p>



<p>But is the worst yet to come?</p>



<p>As you may recall, Chelsea ominously declared that &#8220;bad luck comes in threes,&#8221; a line that many viewers have interpreted as a hint that she&#8217;ll wind up being this season&#8217;s corpse.</p>



<p>It would certainly be a heartbreaking conclusion, but as the death of Tanya McQuoid proved in Season 2, this show is willing to go there.</p>

<p>Where to begin with the wonderfully WASP-y Ratliffs of Raleigh?</p>



<p>Mom&#8217;s pills are disappearing down Dad&#8217;s gullet; Dad might be going to prison for the rest of his life; Piper wants to devote her life to the lotus position; Saxon seems to have every sexual hang-up under the sun; and Lochlan is a living product of all that dysfunction.</p>



<p>One of the big complaints about this season is that Jason Isaacs&#8217; storyline started on an explosive note, but then fizzled out as he spent the four or five episodes just popping lorazepams and stressing out.</p>



<p>We expect that that character arc will come to a head in memorable fashion (in fact, Isaacs&#8217; is the odds-on favorite in online polls about which character will take a bullet).</p>



<p>But in some ways, the even bigger question revolves around <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/arnold-patrick-schwarzenegger-the-white-lotus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Schwarzenegger</a>&#8216;s Saxon &#8212; namely, what the hell is this guy&#8217;s deal?</p>

<p>Kate, Laurie, and Jaclyn have been the best of friends for decades, but they may never speak to each other again following their not-so-wholesome wellness retreat.</p>



<p>Carrie Coon&#8217;s Laurie seems to be the favorite among fans, but Mike White&#8217;s skillful characterization has yielded numerous scenes in which a single line of dialogue can shift our allegiances.</p>



<p>Will a clear winner emerge from this passive-aggressive war for social dominance? </p>



<p>Will the ladies make peace with one another before they go their separate ways?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Michelle Monaghan on an episode of The White Lotus Season 3." class="wp-image-522812" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/michelle-monaghan_1.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Monaghan on an episode of The White Lotus Season 3.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Max)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or (the most likely outcome, in our estimation), will these three friends simply pretend all is well and table their many grievances until they erupt again during their next group excursion?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-will-become-of-mook-and-gaitok-will-belinda-accept-gary-s-offer">What will become of Mook and Gaitok? Will Belinda accept Gary&#8217;s offer?</h2>



<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the matter of the staff members who keep the White Lotus running.</p>



<p>Mook and Gaitok&#8217;s relationship seems to be on the verge of fizzling out thanks to their differing values, but that&#8217;s not the only obstacle facing the Lotus&#8217; most inept security guard &#8212; the gun that&#8217;s under his care will almost certainly play a big role in the finale.</p>



<p>Speaking of criminal behavior, Gary has offered Belinda $100,000 to forget what she knows about the late Tanya McQuoid. </p>

<p>She hasn&#8217;t made up her mind yet, but her decision might bring about the resolution of the only <em>White Lotus</em> storyline that&#8217;s been with us since the pilot.</p>



<p>Speaking of dangling plot threads, remember that <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/white-lotus-poison-fruit-cerbera-odollam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poison fruit</a> that was mentioned at the start of this season? Yeah, this show doesn&#8217;t toss out something like without bringing it full circle. Don&#8217;t be surprised to see one of those bad boys wind up in a Saxon smoothie!</p>



<p>So yeah, there&#8217;s a whole lot that needs to be wrapped up in the Season 3 finale.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d be worried if the task were left up to a lesser showrunner &#8212; but we know we&#8217;re in good hands with the great Mike White.</p>

<p>Ellen Pompeo is scrubbing out of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>In a way she never has before.</p>



<p>The actress is currently starting in Good American Family, a brand new drama on Hulu whose first two episodes were made available on March 19.</p>



<p>The role marks Pompeo&#8217;s first lead since she sky-rocketed to fame back in 2005 as Meredith Grey, the title character of the longest-running medical drama in TV history.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/ellen-pompeo-reveals-the-real-reason-why-shes-leaving-greys-anatomy/">Pompeo pared down her screen time</a> significantly on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8230; although she still serves as a producer and still makes the occasional cameo.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. I just knew that I really couldn&#8217;t do Grey&#8217;s anymore,&#8221; Pompeo explained this week on the Call Her Daddy podcast of that decision. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was to the point where I really just felt like an animal at the zoo. I&#8217;m a big believer in destiny. I thought, if there&#8217;s something else I&#8217;m meant to do, it&#8217;s gonna find me. But I know I have to leave this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pompeo, who earned $20 million per episode in her last ABC contract, had hinted in the past that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/08/ellen-pompeo-im-getting-ready-to-quit-acting/">she was done with acting</a>.</p>



<p>But here she is again.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="921" height="624" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo as Meredith" class="wp-image-454474" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs.jpg 921w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-300x203.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-768x520.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-735x498.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-335x227.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-347x235.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-520x352.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/slack-imgs-640x434.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meredith seeks advice from Amelia in this Grey&#8217;s Anatomy scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes you know you&#8217;d like opportunities to come while you&#8217;re doing something, so you have an easy exit,&#8221; the actress said on this podcast. &#8220;You have a soft landing &#8211; and it turns out I actually <em>did</em> get a soft landing. But I was sort of thinking like nothing&#8217;s coming along, and I really believe in this town, if they want you, they will find you.&#8221;</p>



<p>When a new offer didn&#8217;t immediately present itself, Pompeo began to have some doubts. As anyone would. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on TV for 20 years, the biggest show ever, like everybody knows who I am. &#8220;Clearly, these people don&#8217;t want me,&#8221; she said of her feelings at the time. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not coming for me. No one&#8217;s offering me this [and] no one&#8217;s offering me that. I mean I&#8217;ve been offered a few things, obviously, but like could never make it work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good American Family stars Ellen Pompeo, Mark Duplass, Imogen Faith Reid, Dulé Hill, Christina Hendricks, Sarayu Blue and Jenny O&#8217;Hara.</p>



<p>It is based on a true story and here is the official synopsis:</p>



<p><em>Told from multiple points of view, as a means to explore issues of perspective, bias, and trauma, this compelling drama is inspired by the disturbing stories surrounding a Midwestern couple who adopts a girl with a rare form of dwarfism.</em></p>



<p><em>But as they begin to raise her alongside their three biological children, mystery emerges around her age and background, and they slowly start to suspect she may not be who she says she is. </em></p>



<p><em>As they defend their family from the daughter they&#8217;ve grown to believe is a threat, she fights her own battle to confront her past and what her future holds, in a showdown that ultimately plays out in the tabloids and the courtroom.</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="848" height="905" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image.jpg" alt="Meredith Grey Image" class="wp-image-398357" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image.jpg 848w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-281x300.jpg 281w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-768x820.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-735x784.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-314x335.jpg 314w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-325x347.jpg 325w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-487x520.jpg 487w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-600x640.jpg 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/10/meredith-grey-image-720x768.jpg 720w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">As Meredith Grey, Ellen Pompeo flashes a very big smile in this scene from Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (AbC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the past, it was challenging for the star to step away from a program that shot for 10 months a year.</p>



<p>According to Pompeo, though, times have changed and &#8220;it&#8217;s become a little easier&#8221; to take on other roles since networks have reduced their orders to 15 episodes. </p>



<p>&#8220;But anyway, I had really stepped away, and I had said I really have to step away I can&#8217;t do it anymore,&#8221; she added on the podcast. </p>



<p>&#8220;And if nothing else comes, nothing else comes. It&#8217;s my destiny. [If] no one wants me, that&#8217;s okay, I can swallow that pill like I swallow everything else and at least I&#8217;m financially okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wendy Williams is speaking out.</p>



<p>Just days after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-begs-for-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begging for help</a> from paparazzi and being whisked away in an ambulance to (apparently) pass a cognitive evaluation, she&#8217;s giving an interview.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t Wendy chatting on the street. She spoke on <em>The View</em>.</p>



<p>The talk show legend detailed her brief experience of freedom, the results of her psych test, and her frustration with her &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-punished-for-getting-drunk-at-assisted-living-facility-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxury prison</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-wendy-williams-doing-after-her-hospital-trip">How is Wendy Williams doing after her hospital trip?</h2>



<p>Wendy Williams called in for a pre-taped interview on the Friday, March 14 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv4cdMpP5hs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <em>The View</em>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, she had a lot to say and was adamant about it. And that&#8217;s good, because the panelists of <em>The View</em> had a lot of questions.</p>



<p>&#8220;I needed a breath of fresh air. I needed to see the doctor,&#8221; Wendy explained. &#8220;So that’s why I went to the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>Williams detailed that she had undergone bloodwork, for her thyroid. She has previously complained about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/wendy-williams-denies-dementia-diagnosis-i-havent-been-allowed-to-see-a-doctor-in-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not getting to see a doctor</a> in years without someone else making the decision.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;Which, I don’t have it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams went on to lament: “How dare they say I have incapacitation. I do not!” While Joy Behar is not a neurologist, she did offer her opinion that Wendy Williams sounded just fine to her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-after-the-hospital-wendy-williams-went-out-to-dinner">After the hospital, Wendy Williams went out to dinner</h2>



<p>Ana Navarro then asked Wendy Williams about how she went out to dinner the same night as her hospital trip with niece Alex Finnie. </p>



<p>“It was great at first… They got me at the hospital, and then &#8212; with permission from the guardian, of course &#8212; we left the hospital by ambulance,&#8221; the talk show legend described. &#8220;And we stayed [at the living facility] for about an hour, because we knew were going out to eat, just to celebrate life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Williams detailed: “We went to Tucci, great dinner! There were paparazzi, so we stopped. That’s what I do. I stopped, posed, and these two people that work here… they’re downstairs waiting for me.&#8221; Uh oh!</p>

<p>“I’m not permitted to do anything, but stay on this floor, memory unit,&#8221; Wendy Williams then summarized.</p>



<p>She went on to point out that the unit for those with memory problems is mostly for elderly patients, some of whom she describes as being 90 years old.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 60!&#8221; Williams pointed out. &#8220;Why am I here?!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-all-very-complex">This is all very complex</h2>



<p>Obviously, we all want what&#8217;s best for Wendy Williams. But there are reasonable questions about just what that looks like.</p>



<p>We only have her account on her cognitive evaluation. And in some cases of dementia and dementia-like symptoms, an evaluation on a &#8220;good day&#8221; only provides part of the answer.</p>



<p>That said, so much about Williams&#8217; decline and legal (and financial) situation has been deeply unusual.</p>



<p>It is always worth reevaluation. In general, legal guardianships are not for adults who can coherently protest against the arrangement.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s official, television fans:</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll soon have a reason to believe once again.</p>



<p>On March 14, Apple TV+ confirmed that Ted Lasso will return for a fourth season&#8230; with Jason Sudeikis &#8212; who co-created the show with Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly and Bill Lawrence &#8212; set to reprise his role as the beloved and inspiring title character.</p>

<p>“Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fanbase all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion and unwavering belief,” Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+, said in a statement on Friday.</p>



<p>“Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.”</p>



<p>A day earlier, Sudeikas hinted at this return during an appearance on the Jason Kelce and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/travis-kelce">Travis Kelce</a> podcast, New Heights.</p>



<p>He told the famous hosts that Ted will be coaching a women’s team and added: “It’s daunting, because we told the story we wanted to tell. But there’s more there.”</p>

<p>Following up after confirmation of Season 4 went viral, the actor said in a message of his own:</p>



<p>“We all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ‘look before we leap. In Season 4, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to leap before they look, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.”</p>



<p>Chatter over a possible fourth season has been rampant since the show signed off in May 2023.</p>



<p>In February, Lawrence told The Hollywood Reporter:</p>



<p>“You will find that anybody involved with Ted Lasso will say the same thing: Our fearless leader Jason Sudeikis will talk about that when he’s ready. I’m sure he’s somewhere right now at SNL[‘s 50th anniversary show] answering the same question.”</p>

<p>Last August, Warner Bros. Television reportedly secured options for three original cast members: Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton; Brett Goldstein, who portrays coach Roy Kent; and Jeremy Swift, who stars as Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins.</p>



<p>We cannot state for certain at this time that these stars/characters will be back at Season 4.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a very safe assumption.</p>



<p>Ted Lasso Season 3 wrapped up with Ted deciding to return to the United States in order to be closer to his son and ex-wife, hinting at a reconciliation between former spouses&#8230; while other members of the Richmond team were moving into new phases of their lives. </p>



<p>Season 3 remains Apple TV+’s most watched show to date and finished 2023 as the number-one original streaming series in the United States, according to Nielsen.</p>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is hyping up <em>Patrick </em>Schwarzenegger for his eye-catching new TV role.</p>



<p><em>The White Lotus</em> is prestige television. It reminded the world that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ariana-grande-botox-palm-springs-jennifer-coolidge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Coolidge</a> is a national treasure.</p>



<p>Patrick is a Season 3 star. He is following in his famous father&#8217;s footsteps as an actor.</p>



<p>In fact, he seems to be following pretty closely. Like his dad before him, Patrick stripped down on camera.</p>

<p>Proud father <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/arnold-schwarzenegger-republican/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> recently attended the Season 3 premiere event for <em>The White Lotus</em> to cheer on his son, Patrick.</p>



<p>He even took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DF8dSMQzuiO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to sing the 31-year-old&#8217;s praises while teasing fans about what the season has in store.</p>



<p>“What a show!” gushed the legendary actor and former governor. “I could claim to be surprised to find out he has a nude scene, but what can I say &#8212; the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”</p>

<p>“Don’t miss it this Sunday &#8212; trust me,” Arnold Schwarzenegger then reminded his followers. <em>The White Lotus</em> Season 3 premiere was last night on HBO. And on the poorly-named Max streaming service.</p>



<p>At the same time, Arnold was reminding followers that he&#8217;d engaged in his own nude photoshoot way back in 1970, when he was in his early 20s. The photo was published by<em> Spy Magazine</em> in 1992 as part of a media manipulation story on how the actor&#8217;s management controlled his image.</p>



<p>Remember, this was over 30 years ago. There was an appalling backlash. But Arnold, then one of the most famous actors on the planet, went on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em> to point out that he felt no shame for posing for his art or anything else.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-like-father-like-son">Like father, like son</h2>



<p>In addition to his youthful photo &#8212; which featured full frontal nudity &#8212; Arnold Schwarzenegger also wore little to no clothing for multiple iconic roles.</p>



<p>From wearing next to nothing as Conan to time-traveling naked in <em>Terminator</em> and <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, he felt proud to show off his famous body.</p>



<p>And, now, Arnold Schwarzenegger is clearly feeling proud of Patrick for following in his footsteps. Though, as with many children of any age, his son wouldn&#8217;t mind if he said a little less.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Parents 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/uWnDn2WJQB">https://t.co/uWnDn2WJQB</a></p>&mdash; Patrick Schwarzenegger (@PSchwarzenegger) <a href="https://twitter.com/PSchwarzenegger/status/1889432940452651411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>As reports highlighted Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s comments and him hyping up Patrick&#8217;s nude scene, the <em>The White Lotus</em> star took to Twitter to respond.</p>



<p>&#8220;Parents,&#8221; he <a href="https://x.com/PSchwarzenegger/status/1889432940452651411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, with a pair of facepalming emojis.</p>



<p>His patient embarrassment is endearing and relatable. The tweet is also a reminder that there <em>are </em>downsides to being a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/tori-spelling-marks-90210-anniversary-gets-super-defensive-about-nepo-baby-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nepo baby</a>. Not a lot, but some.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-does-patrick-schwarzenegger-play-on-the-white-lotus-season-3">Who does Patrick Schwarzenegger play on &#8216;The White Lotus&#8217; Season 3?</h2>



<p>On Season 3 of <em>The White Lotus</em>, Patrick Schwarzenegger portrays Saxon Ratliff. He is vacationing with his parents (portrayed by Jason Isaacs and Parker Posey) and two younger siblings.</p>



<p>Fittingly, Patrick&#8217;s Saxon is already working for the family business. One wonders if it is a coincidence, or if some nepo baby typecasting was in play.</p>



<p>Either way, it&#8217;s been an interesting &#8212; and eye-catching &#8212; season. Of course, it&#8217;ll be difficult to top that memorable Season 2 ending.</p>



<p>Regardless of who&#8217;s doing it, it&#8217;s nice to hear that the series will continue to feature nudity. Years and years of anti-sex sentiment has turned so much of television and film into a weird <em>horniness desert</em>. And <em>The White Lotus</em> is doing their part to set things right.</p>

<p>Kelly Ripa wants to make sure that her hunky husband is backing her up.</p>



<p>In the tradition of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/kelly-ripa-gray-divorce-mark-consuelos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly and Mark discussing personal moments</a>, the hosts shared a story about an atrocious neighbor from a few years back. </p>



<p>Kelly&#8217;s reaction at the time was <em>a lot</em>. If it weren&#8217;t for one pivotal detail of her anecdote, she&#8217;d come across as the bad guy.</p>



<p>Even so, she accused Mark of making her out to be the &#8220;villain&#8221; in the story. Awkward!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-kelly-ripa-have-a-karen-moment-no">Did Kelly Ripa have a &#8216;Karen&#8217; moment? (No)</h2>



<p>On recent episode of <em>LIVE With Kelly &amp; Mark</em>, the titular Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos delved into Airbnb cracking down on parties ahead.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/anti-party-crackdown-over-new-years-eve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech</a> itself isn&#8217;t that radical. It&#8217;s just a &#8220;machine learning&#8221; tool that attempts to flag high-risk bookings that could be from people planning to throw parties under the guise of renting a place to sleep. Critics say that it&#8217;s likely as full of flaws as other LLM hogwash as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/secret-invasion-condemned-for-ai-plagiarism-software-opening-credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble collapse</a>s.</p>



<p>However, Kelly thought back on how a group of students rented a neighbor&#8217;s home years ago. The neighbor has since moved. And the timing is everything: this was during the height of COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-1024x576.png" alt="Kelly Ripa gestures beside Mark Consuelos." class="wp-image-515598" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_kellyripa_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gesturing dramatically, Kelly Ripa recalls a chaotic moment while Mark Consuelos watches on.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But they were throwing illegal raves, like discos.&#8221; Kelly shared. This was during a time when restaurants were not even open for dining, when tens of millions of Americans were out of work due to the deadly virus.</p>



<p>Mark chimed in, noting that he remembers this. He was in Vancouver at the time, and Kelly had called him to update him about the harrowing situation. Not only was the viral danger alarming, but the noise was disruptive.</p>



<p>&#8220;First I called 3-1-1. Then I called 9-1-1,&#8221; Kelly recalled. Authorities were unable to help. While that may sound strange to anyone who&#8217;s been warned by police over a noisy party or small fireworks, this was a time when first responders were stretched very thin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, in the middle of the night, in winter, I, in a bathrobe, like a maniac, go over there and bang on the door,&#8221; Kelly described. When someone answered the door, they asked if she was an Uber driver.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m not the Uber, I&#8217;m your neighbor,'&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;These two college kids come out and I go, &#8216;First of all, what you&#8217;re doing is illegal.&#8217; They&#8217;re like, &#8216;No, no, no, we live here.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Kelly continued: &#8220;I go, &#8216;No, you don&#8217;t. I actually know who lives here, and it&#8217;s not you. I&#8217;m sure they don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re throwing a discotheque here. Turn the music off. It&#8217;s a Tuesday.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Though Mark clearly enjoyed parts of his wife&#8217;s story, he did add: &#8220;You became that person.&#8221; Which sounded almost <em>accusatory</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not that person. They are that person,&#8221; Kelly clapped back. &#8220;I like that suddenly I&#8217;m the villain in the story.&#8221;</p>



<p>She did conclude the story by sharing that the 3AM dance party ended, to her delight. Or, at least, to her <em>relief</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-was-the-true-villain-of-the-story">Who was the true &#8216;villain&#8217; of the story?</h2>



<p>Noise complaints are a complex issue. Sometimes, they are mere excuses to harass an &#8220;undesirable&#8221; neighbor. Other times, one thoughtless person is terrorizing their neighbors. </p>



<p>The best insulation against this is not to call the police, who are not there to help, but rather to befriend neighbors. Then it stops being &#8220;Oh, 2C is making noise again&#8221; and starts being &#8220;Oh, sounds like Jeremy&#8217;s having a good time.&#8221; That sense of community might encourage neighbors to be more respectful in turn.</p>



<p>As we mentioned, there&#8217;s a pivotal detail to this story. There is simply no excuse for throwing house parties, in a rental or otherwise, during the height of COVID-19. None. Whatever personality pathologies would drive someone to do this may explain the thoughtless noisiness that plagued Kelly.</p>

<p>Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore have an enviable host-for-host friendship.</p>



<p>They also have corresponding tattoos.</p>



<p>Not everyone likes <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/martha-stewart-shoves-drew-barrymore-after-cringeworthy-petting-attempt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrymore&#8217;s brand of friendliness</a>, but she and Guthrie share a special bond.</p>



<p>And now they&#8217;ve gotten tattooed together &#8212; again.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/10/entertainment/savannah-guthrie-celebrated-her-no-1-book-by-getting-more-ink-with-drew-barrymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a></em> reports that, last week, Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore received tattoos together.</p>



<p>According to inside sources, Guthrie appeared for a taping of Barrymore&#8217;s daytime talk show. She has appeared as a guest before. The episode airs Tuesday, March 11.</p>



<p>The report reveals that Barrymore and Guthrie got inked on camera.</p>

<p>Apparently, Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore were celebrating the former&#8217;s recent success.</p>



<p>Guthrie&#8217;s new Christian children&#8217;s book, Mostly What God Does Is Love You, has reached Number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list.</p>



<p>With over 20,000 copies sold, she and Barrymore decided to mark the occasion with celebratory tattoos.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-tattooed-savannah-guthrie-and-drew-barrymore">Who tattooed Savannah Guthrie and Drew Barrymore?</h2>



<p>JonBoy is a celebrity tattoo artist. A very appropriate choice to tattoo two famous women on TV.</p>



<p>Guthrie received hearts based upon her children&#8217;s drawings, while Barrymore received the word &#8220;time.&#8221; </p>



<p>So no, they are not matching tattoos. </p>



<p>They each hold special meaning, but they went under the needle together. That&#8217;s cute!</p>

<p>It has only been a couple of years since Guthrie and Barrymore received tattoos together in 2023.</p>



<p>However, the two were not on camera for this moment. They only shared the results on <em>The Today Show</em> after the fact.</p>



<p>But when it&#8217;s <em>The Drew Barrymore Show</em>, the eponymous host can choose what they air, whether it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/drew-barrymore-the-talk-even-bill-maher-reverse-scab-plans-amidst-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scabbing</a> during a writer&#8217;s strike or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/drew-barrymore-angela-deem-90-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewing terrible people</a> or a cute tattoo session.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-these-two-have-a-beautiful-friendship">These two have a beautiful friendship</h2>



<p>Tattoos can sometimes be controversial. </p>



<p>There is a sickness in our society where many people feel the need to control others&#8217; bodies.</p>



<p>However, Guthrie and Barrymore have gotten tattoos to mark important milestones and as tributes to loved ones. That&#8217;s sweet!</p>



<p>Hopefully, most viewers won&#8217;t be too weird about this very sweet moment.</p>

<p>Did Joy Behar effectively &#8220;out&#8221; Sara Haines over a &#8220;lesbian relationship&#8221; on <em>The View</em>?</p>



<p>(And in front of her parents?)</p>



<p>Amidst <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sunny-hostin-unrecognizable-in-the-view-season-28-promo-pic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent changes at <em>The View</em></a>, regular contributor Sara Haines stopped by during a recent episode. Joy brought up one of her previous relationships &#8212; and some are accusing her of effectively &#8220;outing&#8221; the beloved journalist. </p>



<p>Is that what happened? Did Joy Behar get into trouble?</p>

<p>On a memorable episode of <em>The View</em>, Sara Haines joined the panel. </p>



<p>Haines, who has been both a <em>The View </em>co-host and a <em>Good Morning America</em> host, discussed relationships with the others. They discussed exes and more &#8212; all while Haines&#8217; parents, Sandy and Dick Haines, were seated in the audience.</p>



<p>Joy Behar then asked Sara Haines: &#8220;I have to ask a question. Are you going to bring up that lesbian relationship you had or not? Back at Smith?&#8221; She was referring to Smith College.</p>

<p>In response, Sarah Haines burst out laughing. </p>



<p>Joy Behar has a blunt manner of asking questions, which can be funny. Laughter can also be a nervous response to feeling surprised or embarrassed.</p>



<p>Haines then quickly shouted to her parents, who were seated in the audience. &#8220;Dad, earmuffs!&#8221; she suggested. Many of us jokingly tell a friend to cover their ears in that fashion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joy-behar-s-co-hosts-called-her-out-over-it">Joy Behar&#8217;s co-hosts called her out over it</h2>



<p>Alyssa Farah Griffin called out Joy Behar, reminding her that Sara Haines&#8217; alleged past relationship was &#8220;off air&#8221; and not public information.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sunny-hostin-leaving-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunny Hostin</a> very realistically commented that &#8220;Now, it&#8217;s on air.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sara Haines did not choose to elaborate. Many people &#8212; most of whom may identify as straight &#8212; have same-sex relationships and hookups in their pasts. Most of the time, when someone chooses to not identify as anything other than straight, they also do not publicly disclose this in our deeply homophobic society.</p>



<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tv/article-14026147/The-View-Joy-Behar-crossed-line-bosses-exposed-Sara-Haines-lesbian-relationship.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that co-hosts went on to further criticize Joy Behar for &#8220;embarrassing&#8221; Sara Haines.</p>



<p>Allegedly, higher ups told Joy Behar that what she said was &#8220;not OK.&#8221; That&#8217;s according to <em>The Daily Mail</em>&#8216;s report.</p>



<p>Joy Behar has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/joy-behar-happy-to-be-fired-from-the-view-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gotten into trouble</a> at <em>The View</em> before. But did she receive professional backlash for what went down on that episode?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maybe-she-didn-t-get-into-trouble-after-all">Maybe she didn&#8217;t get into trouble after all</h2>



<p><em>Page Six</em> reports that, no, Joy Behar was &#8220;not reprimanded&#8221; for one clear reason.</p>



<p>“Sara freely shared the story with the studio audience last week, although it was off camera,” the inside source explained. “She did not have a private conversation about it with her co-hosts.”</p>



<p>In general, it&#8217;s best to clear something like that with a person before bringing it up. </p>



<p>However, if a famous person has already told a crowded room about something, it&#8217;s arguably no longer a <em>secret</em>.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, Meghan Markle is starring in a new Netflix series titled &#8220;With Love, Meghan.&#8221;</p>



<p>And in case you also haven&#8217;t heard, the show is not exactly getting met with enthusiastic rounds of applause and/or praise.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-uses-daughter-lilibet-to-promote-netflix-show-cant-do-anything-right/">Markle was accused of exploiting</a> her daughter to market the series.</p>



<p>Then, she garnered some backlash when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-corrects-mindy-kaling-on-how-to-address-her-during-awkward-with-love-meghan-segment/">she corrected Mindy Kaling</a> on her last name, claiming she should know by referred to as Meghan Sussex.</p>

<p>For the most part, viewers have come down hard on Markle for being inauthentic and self-absorbed.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s almost nothing when compared to what Stuart Heritage of The Guardian wrote a few days ago after checking out the program for the first time.</p>



<p>Referring to the overall production deal Markle and husband Prince Harry signed with Netflix, this critic writes:</p>



<p><strong><em>With Love, Meghan doesn’t just represent the hard launch of Duchess of Sussex’s new career as a Martha Stewart-style lifestyle inspo guru; it might also be the final thing she makes for Netflix.</em></strong></p>

<p>Back in 2021, the spouses signed a five-year deal with the streaming service worth $100 million, with executives hoping it would lead to one hit show after another.</p>



<p>Instead, last year introduced viewers to Polo, a behind-the-scenes look at a sport not exactly well known or beloved around the world.</p>



<p>Neither Harry nor Meghan appeared on screen.</p>



<p>The show came and went and we bet almost no one reading this at the moment even knew it existed.</p>

<p>Prior to this release, there was 2023’s documentary Heart of Invictus, which also had limited appeal. </p>



<p>Outside the Netflix contract, there was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-ruined-her-spotify-podcast/">Meghan’s bizarre podcast</a>, Archetypes, which ran for 12 episodes in 2022 and was the grand total of the couple’s $20 million Spotify deal.</p>



<p>When it comes to Markle&#8217;s solo series here, Heritage mocks the content for featuring almost nothing but a &#8220;woman filling children’s party bags with seeds and manuka honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continues to trash the former actress by stating:</p>



<p><em><strong>The thirsty part of Meghan still exists.. it’s evident in her decision to rebrand herself in With Love, Meghan. The problem is that nobody wants to see Meghan making decorative ladybird crostini with Mindy Kaling. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>With Love, Meghan is the sort of gormless lifestyle filler that, had it been made by the BBC, would be used to bulk out episodes of Saturday Kitchen</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Previously, Meghan McCain made it clear <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-mccain-i-absolutely-hate-meghan-markle/">how much she hates Meghan Markle</a>.</p>



<p>Five years after ditching The Royal Family, Markle&#8217;s reputation has never been worse.</p>



<p>Writing that Harry and Meghan are most appealing when they&#8217;re &#8220;whining,&#8221; Heritage concludes that they should aim to be reality stars along the lines of those who starred in various MTV shows in the early and mid-2000s.</p>



<p><em><strong>There are rumours that Netflix may not cut its losses with the Sussexes completely, instead preferring to keep them on at a vastly reduced rate. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>This is good news for the content developed but not yet delivered, such as the adaptation of the novel Meet Me at the Lake, and possibly even their aborted animation show, Pearl. But mainly it’s good news for us. </strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>If this really is the last roll of the dice, then it may be time for Harry and Meghan to face the inevitable and become the new Osbournes.</strong></em></p>
