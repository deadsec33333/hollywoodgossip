<p>Though <em>Snow White</em> enjoyed a strong opening weekend, it fell short of some more optimistic projections.</p>



<p>Some are blaming audience fatigue with Disney&#8217;s live action remakes. Others are blaming <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/snow-white-controversy-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Snow White</em>&#8216;s controversies</a>.</p>



<p>And some are straight-up blaming Rachel Zegler, the star who plays the titular Disney princess.</p>



<p>One of those people is the adult son of the film&#8217;s producer. In a since-deleted rant, he seemingly accused Zegler of &#8220;narcissism&#8221; and of sabotaging her own film&#8217;s box office numbers.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler for Snow White on March 15 of 2025." class="wp-image-522248" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the World Premiere of Disney&#8217;s Snow White at El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on March 15, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-snow-white-made-nearly-90-million-on-its-opening-weekend">&#8216;Snow White&#8217; made nearly $90 million on its opening weekend</h2>



<p>Last weekend, Disney&#8217;s live-action<em> Snow White</em> remake opened a little below expectations. It made $43 million domestically and $87.3 million globally.</p>



<p>While that&#8217;s <em>far </em>from a flop, people are already looking to assign blame. </p>



<p>In part because there is a cottage industry rooting for every new thing &#8212; television, film, and video games specifically to fail, and then to provide a poisonous &#8220;explanation.&#8221;</p>



<p>In this case, <em>Snow White</em> was controversial for both valid and invalid reasons long before it premiered. And there are certain figures who seem eager to blame the star, Rachel Zegler.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler stuns on March 20, 2025." class="wp-image-522250" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the special screening of Disney&#8217;s Snow White at The Whitby Hotel on March 20, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, Rachel Zegler&#8217;s acting in the film has received very positive reviews. Some people have taken umbrage because Zegler is of Colombian and Polish descent. You can likely guess which side of her family tree has elicited ire from <em>the usual crowd</em>.</p>



<p>Zegler is also outspoken with positive messaging. In 2024, she wrote a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/rachel-zegler-trump-apology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scathing takedown of Donald Trump</a>. She has also been adamant about the liberation of Palestinians amidst the genocidal bombing campaign by the IDF.</p>



<p>The latter has come up again. <em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/snow-white-death-threats-zegler-social-media-guru-1236347433/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> </em>recently reported that producer Marc Platt flew to meet with Zegler in August of 2024 to ask her to remove a &#8220;free Palestine&#8221; comment that she had made on social media. The context was that she was thanking fans for watching the <em>Snow White</em> trailer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jonah-platt-is-not-a-rachel-zegler-fan-it-seems">Jonah Platt is not a Rachel Zegler fan, it seems</h2>



<p>Obviously, the story elicited numerous comments &#8212; including hefty criticisms of Disney (who seemingly prompted the social media intervention) and of producer Marc Platt himself.</p>



<p>When a commenter called Platt &#8220;creepy as hell&#8221; for policing Zegler&#8217;s social media commentary, Platt&#8217;s son saw it.</p>



<p>Jonah Platt launched into a rant &#8212; one that he, in what one might call irony, has since deleted.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on March 2, 2025." class="wp-image-522254" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_04-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“You really want to do this? Yeah, my dad, the producer of enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to fly across the country,&#8221; Jonah Platt began his now-deleted comment, according to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/snow-white-marc-platt-jonah-slams-rachel-zegler-1236173434/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>.</p>



<p>He complained that his father &#8220;<em>had</em>&#8221; to fly out &#8220;to reprimand his 20 year old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie.&#8221;</p>



<p>A film, he noted, &#8220;for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicity for.”</p>

<p>“This is called adult responsibility and accountability,&#8221; Jonah Platt, who despite the tone of his message is only 38, continued. &#8220;And her actions clearly hurt the film’s box office.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continued: &#8220;Free speech does not mean you’re allowed to say whatever you want in your private employment without repercussions.&#8221; That much, at least, is generally true.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation,&#8221; Jonah Platt claimed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on March 15, 2025 with a dazzling smile." class="wp-image-522256" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0327_rachelzegler_06-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Rachel Zegler attends the world premiere of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Snow White&#8221; at the El Capitan theatre in Los Angeles, March 15, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jonah Platt went on to allege that she &#8220;hijacked&#8221; promotion of <em>Snow White</em> &#8220;for her own immature desires.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added that she did so &#8220;at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a bizarre twist, Jonah Platt concluded with: &#8220;Narcissism is not something to be coddled or encouraged.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-casting-is-probably-not-where-this-film-went-awry">Casting is probably not where this film went awry</h2>



<p>Fellas, is it <em>narcissism </em>to, in a social media thread thanking your own fans for watching a movie trailer, advocate against ongoing atrocities?</p>



<p>Just for the record, both Jonah Platt and Marc Platt have used their own platforms to speak out publicly on issues near and dear to their own hearts.</p>



<p>Unlike his rant about Zegler, Jonah Platt was absolutely right when he has repeatedly condemned <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-takes-out-super-bowl-ad-for-yeezy-website-that-only-sells-swastika-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a>. And Snow White isn&#8217;t even the first film in the past year that Marc Platt has produced where one or more stars have spoken out on behalf of the Palestinian people.

<p>Did Rachel Zegler commenting influence the <em>Snow White</em> box office? Sure. Everything does. Gal Gadot&#8217;s too. Peter Dinklage&#8217;s commentary surely did, too, and he&#8217;s not even <em>in </em>the film.</p>



<p>But then, Zegler cannot conceivably be responsible for the film&#8217;s budget ballooning to $270 million. Reportedly <em>Snow White</em> also went through nearly half a dozen script doctors. By most accounts, her performance <em>carries </em>the film.</p>



<p>Pretending that a lead actor saying something decent on social media can tank a film seems like a great way to discourage other actors from saying decent things on social media. </p>



<p>But that does not make it a reality.</p>

<p><em>Snow White</em> is releasing amidst controversy.</p>



<p>All of Disney&#8217;s live-action adaptations ruffle some feathers. Usually, it&#8217;s a discussion about art or copyright.</p>



<p>Starring <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/rachel-zegler-trump-apology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Zegler</a> as the titular fairy tale princess and Gal Gadot as the Queen, this adaptation will once again retell a Brothers Grimm classic.</p>



<p>Adaptations can often be polarizing. But the controversy surrounding this <em>Snow White</em> has little to do with the story.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on February 10, 2025." class="wp-image-521169" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the 2025 New York Theatre Workshop Gala at Gotham Hall on February 10, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rachel-zegler-plays-the-lead-in-snow-white">Rachel Zegler plays the lead in &#8216;Snow White&#8217;</h2>



<p>Sometimes, discussing a controversy means delving into the heart of a complex issue, or questioning whether we can separate a piece of media from a horrible person who is a part of it. Both of those do come up when discussing this film.</p>



<p>But in this case, the first &#8220;controversy&#8221; about <em>Snow White</em> is neither. There is a certain group of people who are furious that a latine actor like Rachel Zegler would play Snow White.</p>



<p>To be clear, Zelger has extremely fair skin and very dark hair. She matches the description of Snow White, despite not being white within the social construct of &#8220;race.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zelger on February 18, 2024." class="wp-image-521170" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the 2024 People&#8217;s Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on February 18, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a 2022 interview, Zegler pointed out that the classic animated <em>Snow White</em> is an enduring favorite in many Spanish-speaking countries.</p>



<p>&#8220;I get to be a Latina princess,&#8221; she excitedly told <em><a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/rachel-zegler-snow-white-casting-backlash-1235165496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a></em> at the time. </p>



<p>This excitement, which will connect her and the story to many viewers, is exactly what makes this <em>Snow White</em> a controversy among certain people. If you see other people&#8217;s mere existence as a threat to yourself, then you will react negatively to their excitement and joy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-snow-white-ableist-towards-little-people">Is &#8216;Snow White&#8217; ableist towards little people?</h2>



<p>This is where we get into a <em>Snow White</em> controversy that is actually worthy of discussion rather than derision. Because Snow White famously finds refuge with seven dwarves.</p>



<p>In some versions of the story, this means seven creatures from folklore. But in others, it means seven little people &#8212; people with dwarfism.</p>



<p>“You’re still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&#8221; remarked <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/peter-dinklage-disney-responds-snow-white-criticism-1235080612/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Dinklage</a> in 2022. &#8220;Take a step back and look at what you’re doing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Emmy-winning actor continued: &#8220;It makes no sense to me. You’re progressive in one way, but then you’re still making that f&#8211;king backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together?”</p>



<p>At the time, Disney responded by consulting with the dwarfism community. In 2023, it was revealed that of the seven dwarves in this <em>Snow White</em> adaptation, one is a little person, while the other six are not. Is that the right call? Or is it taking away acting jobs from little people?</p>



<p>As we said, a complex topic. The blurring of little people with mountain-dwelling fantasy people makes this casting complex. Some little people would rather see seven disabled actors fill the role. Others would prefer to not have their disability treated as a separate species, even in film. </p>



<p>(Just a reminder, <em>many </em>fantasy stories cast little people actors without portraying them as non-humans, from Nyomi Sedai on <em>Wheel of Time</em> to Dinklage&#8217;s <em>Game of Thrones</em> character)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler on November 18, 2024." class="wp-image-521172" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler attends the &#8220;Y2K&#8221; New York Screening at Crosby Street Hotel on November 18, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-this-snow-white-adaptation-be-feminist">Will this &#8216;Snow White&#8217; adaptation be feminist?</h2>



<p>In 2023, Rache Zegler suggested during a red carpet interview that Snow White will be more feminist than the 1937 film. </p>



<p>“It’s no longer 1937 . . . She’s not going to be saved by the prince, and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love. She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be,” she excitedly told Variety.</p>



<p>In a sane world, that would be good news. Most people enjoy it when main characters have their own agency, making choices during a story rather than simply reacting with panicked hysterics. Unfortunately, we live in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a world gone mad</a>.</p>

<p>The usual clowns reacted with fury and indignation, taking aim at Rachel Zegler and raising the specter of controversy about the new <em>Snow White</em>.</p>



<p>Zegler herself expressed sadness that people tried to twist her words into criticism of the original film, which she loves.</p>



<p>She emphasized that Snow White can have love and independence, noting that the &#8220;love story is very integral.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rachel-zegler-and-gal-gadot-clash-on-the-genocide-in-gaza">Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot clash on the genocide in Gaza</h2>



<p>In late 2023, the government of Israel launched a massive bombing campaign and invasion of Gaza, ostensibly to liberate Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack.</p>



<p>Some very deliberate conflation of Palestinians with Hamas combined with literal generations of propaganda meant that many Americans lack a contextual understanding of the plight that Palestinians already faced.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> reports that the Israeli military slaughtered nearly 50,000 Palestinians. </p>



<p>More than half of the victims were women, children, or the elderly. And yes, this all ties in to the Snow White controversy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1024x683.jpg" alt="Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot on March 2, 2025 at the Oscars." class="wp-image-521174" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0312_rachelzegler_05-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot speak onstage during the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Rachel Zegler has publicly affirmed her support for the people of Palestine. Yet the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel has called for a boycott of <em>Snow White</em>.</p>



<p>The reason for that is Gal Gadot, who portrays the Queen. Gadot served in the IDF for two years, and has been openly and publicly pro-Israel.

<p>In other words, people on both sides of one of the most polarizing atrocities in decades believe that one of the lead actresses is on the right side and that the other is not. Which means that people on both sides will be avoiding it, for either good or bad reasons.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-box-office-decide">Will the box office decide?</h2>



<p>Disney is a behemoth, in part because the massive and controversial corporation routinely prioritizes profits over art and over people. The latest example is the company&#8217;s rollback of DEI policies, seemingly out of a craven desire to avoid being targeted by the Trump administration.</p>



<p>Even Disney has flops, however. And upsetting various and disparate (even mutually exclusive) groups of potential viewers can help make that happen.</p>



<p>At the same time &#8230; not everyone is aware of literally any of this. There are millions of blissfully offline people who will see &#8220;that pretty girl and the lady from <em>Wonder Woman</em>&#8221; and not know a single thing about either of them. What is <em>that </em>like?</p>

<p>Disney is telling fans &#8220;you&#8217;re welcome&#8221; with their recently released <em>Moana 2</em>. Even though the sequel just came out, audiences are already asking about the possibility of a third <em>Moana </em>film.</p>



<p>While Disney has yet to share official plans for a third <em>Moana </em>film, it seems very likely that fans will see the Polynesian Princess back on the big screen. </p>



<p>Keep reading to find out all the details you need to know about <em>Moana 3</em>.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-does-moana-3-come-out">When Does &#8216;Moana 3&#8217; Come Out?</h2>



<p>A third <em>Moana </em>film has not yet been announced, and it&#8217;s unclear when it will be released. The first film in the franchise came out in 2016. <em>Moana 2 </em>hit theaters eight years later, in 2024.</p>



<p>If a third sequel keeps with that pattern, <em>Moana 3 </em>may not arrive until 2032, but it could always be more or less time in between. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-disney-will-probably-make-moana-3">Why  Disney Will Probably Make &#8216;Moana 3&#8217;</h2>



<p>Fans were surprised when the reviews for <em>Moana 2 </em>came in. Despite the first film being considered a modern classic, the <em><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moana_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a></em> score dropped significantly for the second installment. The first movie has a 95% critic rating, while the sequel has a 62% critic rating on the site.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1473068777-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dwayne Johnson attends the 95th Annual Academy Awards on March 12, 2023 in Hollywood, California.

<p></p>



<p>While critics may have been less into the sequel than the first film, the audience rating is still very high! The audience rating is currently at 87%. Even though the critics may not be as into the new movie, fans are certainly loving it. That&#8217;s even more incentive to give them another film.</p>



<p>The movie has also already set box office records, according to <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/12/02/two-points-of-promising-news-about-moana-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a></em>. The film set a record for biggest opening weekend for an animated film of all time. Of course, if people are buying tickets, that&#8217;s even more reason to make another movie.</p>



<p>Taking a page out of the Marvel playbook, Disney seems to have already teased a third <em>Moana</em> film. Almost like it came out of an <em>Avengers </em>film, <em>Moana 2 </em>has a mid-credits scene, which perfectly sets up a third movie. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-moana-3-about">What Is &#8216;Moana 3&#8217; About?</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="737" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139356-1024x737.jpg" alt="Auli'i Cravalho at D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event in Anaheim, California on August 09, 2024.

<p></p>



<p><em>Moana 3 </em>has yet to be announced, but fans are definitely hoping for specific things in the movie. First, everyone is looking forward to seeing Auli&#8217;i Cravalho reprise her role as Moana and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/dwayna-the-rock-johnson-returning-moana-2-sequels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson as Maui. </a></p>



<p>Many plot details are yet to be announced, but the post-credits scene in <em>Moana 2 </em>sets up a very exciting third movie. The scene features Nalo, the storm god who wanted to rule over all mortals, his enforcer Matangi, and Tamatoa, the giant coconut crab from the first film. </p>



<p>In the scene, Nalo is preparing to punish Matangi for failing to defeat Moana and Maui. Then, they&#8217;re interrupted by Tamatoa, who promises to help him. It seems like the third film will have a superhero-worthy villain team-up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-live-action-moana">Live-Action &#8216;Moana&#8217;</h2>



<p>While a third sequel has not yet been announced, Disney did reveal that they were making a live-action version of <em>Moana </em>in 2023. Filming took place from July to November 2024.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-682x1024.jpg" alt="Dwayne Johnson at D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event in Anaheim, California on August 09, 2024." class="wp-image-515689" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2166139358-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dwayne Johnson at D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event in Anaheim, California on August 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for Disney)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a video announcement, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/dwayne-johnson-im-done-with-the-fast-and-furious-and-vin-diesel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rock spoke</a> about how special it was to tap into his heritage. &#8220;This story is my culture, and this story is emblematic of our people’s grace and warrior strength,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wear this culture proudly on my skin and in my soul, and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reunite with Maui—inspired by the mana and spirit of my late grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia—is one that runs very deep for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>It appears that the new live-action film will follow the events of the first movie. In his video announcement, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/dwayne-johnson-walks-back-support-of-joe-rogan-my-bad-i-didnt-re/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwayne revealed</a> that he&#8217;d be returning as Maui, but he&#8217;s the only actor set to return for the live-action movie.</p>



<p>The remake will feature Catherine Laga&#8217;aia as Moana, John Tui as Chief Tui, Frankie Adams as Sina, and Rena Owen as Gramma Tala, per <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27419466/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a></em>. </p>



<p>The film is expected to premiere in 2026, which is fitting as that will mark the 10th anniversary of the original film. We can&#8217;t wait!</p>

<p>A Selena Gomez <em>Agatha All Along </em>cameo could be spectacular. And it could make a surprising amount of sense.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re halfway through Disney+ premiere season of the long-awaited <em>Agatha All Along</em>, and fans are buzzing with excitement.</p>



<p>The reviews for  <em>WandaVision </em>spinoff are decidedly positive, both from critics and fans alike. </p>



<p>The latter felt particularly justified when one of their conspiracy theories about a new character turned out to be very true! </p>



<p>Now, they&#8217;ve moved on to the next item on the wishlist: Selena Gomez making her MCU debut. </p>



<p>Sounds crazy &#8211; except honestly, it&#8217;s really not. In truth, crazier things have happened &#8211; and Disney has already playing into the idea! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whispers-say-that-selena-gomez-appears-in-agatha-all-along">Whispers say that Selena Gomez appears in &#8216;Agatha All Along&#8217;</h2>



<p>Each new MCU project brings exciting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/king-charles-deadpool-and-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel cameo rumors</a>. Some of them turn out to be true &#8212; like Jennifer Garner reprising her role as Elektra in <em>Deadpool</em>.</p>



<p>Thus far, the whispers of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-mcu-dazzler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift playing Dazzler</a>, a mutant pop star, have yet to materialize. </p>



<p>Where on the spectrum do the Selena Gomez <em>Agatha All Along </em>rumors fall? Well, let&#8217;s look at the context.</p>



<p>Claims of Selena Gomez appearing in some capacity on <em>Agatha All Along</em> have been in circulation since late 2023.</p>



<p>It makes sense. She&#8217;s an enormously talented actress with multiple Disney ties, from her teen acting era to Hulu&#8217;s <em>Only Murders In The Building</em>. (More on that in a bit).</p>



<p>Selena is also an exceptional singer.  Given that the show takes its name from a <em>WandaVision </em>song and also co-stars <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kim-kardashian-slammed-patti-lupone-ahs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadway legend Patti LuPone</a>, Selena sounds like a very good fit. </p>



<p>Adding her voice to the Ballad of the Witches Road would be sensational. But these are just a few reasons why she&#8217;d be a good fit. </p>



<p>Where&#8217;s the proof she&#8217;s joining the cast? Enter Aubrey Plaza to the chat. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-going-down-in-the-comments-aubrey">What&#8217;s Going Down In The Comments, Aubrey?</h2>



<p>Beloved actress Audrey Plaza plays Rio Vidal, one of the witches of<em> Agatha All Along</em>. </p>



<p>Like the rest of the cast, she feels perfect for this witchy role. It <em>also </em>feels<em> </em>like Marvel really leaned into market research on the passionate LGBTQ+ audience for <em>WandaVision </em>and decided to, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/erika-jayne-responds-to-jennifer-lawrence-im-not-evil-im-just-going-through-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erika Jayne</a> might say, &#8220;give the gays everything they want.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Aubrey took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_3Ydt4P_Oj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to share her character poster ahead of the September 18 <em>Agatha All Along</em> premiere, one comment in particular drew people&#8217;s attention.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1001" height="594" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of Selena Gomez having left a fire emoji under Aubrey Plaza's Instagram post for Agatha All Along." class="wp-image-509621" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01.png 1001w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01-300x178.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01-768x456.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/0918_aubreyplaza_ig_01-960x570.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In a reply to Aubrey Plza&#8217;s Instagram post of her Agatha All Along character post, Selena Gomez left a simple affirming comment. What does it mean?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Selena Gomez herself, the Queen of Instagram with nearly half a billion followers, responded to Aubrey Plaza with a &#8220;fire&#8221; emoji.</p>



<p>Now, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/selena-gomez-net-worth-billionaire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaire singers</a> use Instagram to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/taylor-swift-ryan-reynolds-sperm-donor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promote Marvel projects</a> from people they admire. Taylor boosted <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> without appearing in it. It&#8217;s always possible that Selena is doing the same for <em>Agatha All Along</em>.</p>



<p>But this is just the first piece of a larger puzzle! </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1024x576.png" alt="A screenshot of WandaVision showing Kathryn Hahn from the Agatha All Along sequence." class="wp-image-509622" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/Agatha-All-Along-03.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the &#8220;Agatha All Along&#8221; sequence of WandaVision, Kathryn Hahn portrays Agatha Harkness in a montage that reveals her involvement in the entire season&#8217;s events.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Disney+)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-makes-perfect-sense-for-selena-to-join-the-coven">It Makes Perfect Sense For Selena To Join The Coven </h2>



<p><em>WandaVision </em>was chalk full of television references. Wanda Maximoff&#8217;s ability to warp reality had transformed a town into a living sitcom, like if <em>Once Upon A Time</em> had a bigger budget and more consistent writing.</p>



<p>There is a prominent theory that Selena Gomez will reprise her role as Alex Russo from <em>Wizards of Waverly Place</em>. We have no idea of the potential context of this, except that there are many possibilities with ample precedent within the MCU.</p>



<p>Remember, Disney+ is developing a <em>Wizards of Waverly Place</em> sequel series starring David Henrie. It&#8217;s smart to have a soft promo for the project. (And even if it doesn&#8217;t happen, the rumor can only help the show)</p>



<p>As for the vehicle by which we might meet Alex Russo, Selena Gomez&#8217;s character &#8230; there are a lot of possibilities. Remember, Agatha&#8217;s been inside a living television show before. Magical hijinks are almost inevitable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-crosses-over-into-the-mcu-kind-of">Selena Crosses Over Into The MCU &#8211; Kind Of</h2>



<p>We mentioned Only Murder In The Building before, and as of October 2024, there are no bigger shows for the House of Mouse than Selena&#8217;s joint effort with Steve Martin and Martin Short and the debut of Agatha All Along. </p>



<p>With that in mind, and perhaps jumping off the feverish demand to see Selena in the MCU, Disney dropped a huge hint that it wasn&#8217;t such a far-fetched idea with a new promo for both shows!</p>



<p>In the video, Agatha takes over the Arconia, speaking directly to Selena&#8217;s character Mabel over the wireless radio in her apartment. Agatha is even seen in the window of the now famous NYC apartment complex in the opening credits. </p>



<p>Is it just a PR stunt to promote the shows? Of course, but it proves that a cross over is possible &#8211; so maybe this is just the beginning? </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fan-theories-keep-turning-out-to-be-right-on-the-money">Fan Theories Keep Turning Out To Be Right On The Money</h2>



<p>Quick <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">spoiler alert</span></strong> for anyone who is watching to watch when all the episodes are out:</p>



<p>Since the appearance of Joe Locke in the trailers as &#8220;Teen&#8221;, fans guessed that he would turn out to be a crucial character in the MCU. And they were very right!</p>



<p>In the fifth episode, <em>Agatha All Along</em> confirmed Teen is actually Billy Kaplan, aka Wiccan, aka one of Marvel&#8217;s best comics characters. Billy is more than just the son of Scarlet Witch and grandson of Magneto &#8212; he&#8217;s immensely powerful. </p>



<p>Remember Xochitl Gomez&#8217;s America Chavez from <em>Doctor Strange And The Multiverse of Madness</em>? In comics, he was the demiurge who created her home universe before the two became teammates.</p>



<p>Billy Kaplan brings us one step closer to having a solid Young Avengers starting lineup. But we desperately need Teddy Altman (Hulkling, who is both Skrull and Kree). </p>



<p>But aside from all that, it proves that fans are tapped into what Disney is playing at with this series. And so, if the Wiccan theory can turn out to be true, why not the Selena one! </p>

<p>Skai Jackson was recently arrested on domestic battery charges following a fight with her boyfriend, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/13/skai-jackson-arrested-fight-boyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> is reporting.</p>



<p>According to the outlet, Skai was taken into custody after she shoved her partner multiple times at an LA mall.</p>



<p>Security guards witnessed the altercation, and eventually, police got involved.</p>

<p>Initially, Skai and her boyfriend both denied that their argument had gotten physical.</p>



<p>But the authorities reviewed security cam footage that allegedly showed Skai shoving her male companion.</p>



<p>The couple agreed to be detained until police arrived, at which time Skai was arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, Skai was taken into custody but was &#8220;released a few hours later.&#8221;</p>



<p>Little is known about Skai&#8217;s boyfriend, as both parties seem invested in keeping the relationship private.</p>



<p>Prior to her arrest Skai informed the authorities that she and her partner were engaged and expecting a baby together.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-skai-jackson">What&#8217;s Next For Skai Jackson?</h2>



<p>Skai was charged with a misdemeanor. But since it sounds like the altercation was limited to shoving, it&#8217;s unlikely that she&#8217;ll face any major legal consequences.</p>



<p>Best known for her roles on the Disney Channel series <em>Jessie</em> and <em>Bunk&#8217;d</em>, the 22-year-old has been involved in some high-profile feuds in recent years.</p>

<p>As far back as her teens (and her Disney Channel era), Skai developed a reputation for never shying away from bullies.</p>



<p>Longtime fans might remember when a young <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/05/skai-jackson-just-owned-azealia-banks-on-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skai went up against Azealia Banks</a>.</p>



<p>She turned out to be one of very few celebs capable of taking the sharp-tongued rapper down a peg.</p>

<p>It sounds like Skai&#8217;s combative tendencies got the best of her while she was shopping with her boyfriend recently.</p>



<p>We hope that this was nothing more than an isolated incident and that the couple will be able to move on from it.</p>



<p>Skai is still very young, and she may still have a bright future in Hollywood. But legal trouble and reports of an uncontrollable temper are enough to derail any career.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Disney fans enjoyed the best of both worlds with Miley Cyrus returning as Hannah Montana during a very special performance. </p>



<p>There is an entire generation of folks who remember Miley’s rise to superstar status as a Disney Channel darling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been 18 years since Miley first debuted her alter ego, Hannah Montana &#8211; and fans were delighted to see her  bring Hannah out of retirement for a very special reason. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="701" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103-1024x701.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-506339" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103-300x206.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103-768x526.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103-960x658.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103-1080x740.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1986477103.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Miley Cyrus performs onstage during the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miley-cyrus-resurrects-hannah-montana-for-disney-legends-ceremony"><strong>Miley Cyrus Resurrects Hannah Montana For Disney Legends Ceremony</strong></h2>



<p>Every year, the House of Mouse celebrates a collection of creative contributors to their enduring brand. Over the past decade or so, the ceremony honoring the new Disney Legend inductees has been held at the D23 Expo.</p>



<p>It’s like Comic-Con, but for just Disney stuff!</p>



<p>This year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/miley-cyrus-disappears-from-social-media-amid-parents-divorce-sparks-concern-among-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="66">Miley Cyrus is among</a> the 14 actors, musicians, entertainers, and more being honored at the event. It’s poised to be the highlight of the expo, closing out the event on Sunday, Aug. 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details of the event were kept very hush-hush; all that’s known for sure is who will be inducted and that the event will be hosted by <a data-wpil-monitor-id="68" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/vanna-white-ryan-seacrest-feud-wheel-of-fortune/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Seacrest</a>. </p>



<p>However, musical guests who have been named Disney Legends in the past have performed before receiving their honor. For example, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/britney-spears-trashes-christina-aguilera-in-wake-of-conservator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="69">Christina Aguilera</a> was inducted in 2019, she performed Reflections from the movie Mulan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in 2011, Paige O&#8217;Hara, Lea Salonga, Anika Noni Rose and Jodi Bensen &#8211; the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/coco-lee-disney-actress-who-voiced-mulan-dead-at-48/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="70">voice actresses behind Disney</a> Princesses Belle, Jasmine, Tiana, and Ariel &#8211; all performed together after being inducted as Legends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it wasn&#8217;t inconceivable that Miley would perform during her Legends performance. </p>



<p>The real question was &#8211; what would she sing?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miley-cyrus-performs-the-best-of-both-worlds-at-disney-legends-show"><strong>Miley Cyrus Performs ‘The Best Of Both Worlds’ At Disney Legends Show?</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps the most iconic and beloved song from Miley’s time as Hannah Montana is &#8220;The Climb&#8221;. From the <em>Hannah Montana</em> movie soundtrack, it’s a song Miley herself has enjoyed performing on every tour since she retired the blonde wig. </p>



<p>But Miley decided to throw it all the way back to Hannah&#8217;s roots and perform the theme song to the Hannah Montana show, &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C97fbZ7OD0V/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best of Both Worlds</a>&#8220;. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Miley Cyrus singing and doing the choreo of the “Best Of Both Worlds” ???? <a href="https://t.co/uI6WChBHGP">pic.twitter.com/uI6WChBHGP</a></p>&mdash; MileyUpdates | Fan Account (@MileyUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MileyUpdates/status/1822845380008067570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Except she didn&#8217;t perform it, exactly. See, initially, the rumor was that Miley would throw on the wig one more time and bust out the jam on stage. But instead, Lainey Wilson performed “The Best of Both Worlds” while Miley watched on from her sear in the front row!</p>



<p>However, eagle eyed fans caught the newly crowned Disney Legends not only singing along word for word, but actually busting out the choreography from her seat!</p>



<p>Is it the same? No. Will we take it all the same? YES!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miley-still-embraces-hannah"><strong>Miley Still Embraces Hannah</strong></h2>



<p>“I was Hannah Montana, and I was so proud to be,” Miley shared in her Disney Legends speech, choking up. “I stand here still proud to have been Hannah Montana because she made Miley in so many ways.”</p>



<p>Over the years, when asked about her experience as Disney&#8217;s number one superstar, Miley confessed that it was a lot of work, but that she looks back fondly. </p>



<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/miley-cyrus-cover-interview-2024">W magazine</a>,</em> Miley reflected on all the hard work that led her to become the youngest person ever to be given the Disney Legend honor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People have 50- or 60-year-long careers, but mine has been close to 20 years, and I’m 31. I have been in the public for more of my life than I haven’t,” she said. However, she still described her Disney years as “a great, safe experience overall.”</p>



<p>“They say that the creative adult is the child who survived. I worked really hard as a child,” she continued.</p>



<p>Indeed she did. Miley also recognized how much of her adult success is tied to her childhood persona. That’s why she so often does callbacks to Hannah on her social media pages.</p>



<p>She even penned the song, &#8220;Used To Be Young&#8221;, as a tribute to the kid who fought to be the woman she is today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the lyrics, Cyrus references how her appearance has changed over the years. &#8220;I don&#8217;t dress the same / Me and who you say I was yesterday / Have gone our separate ways.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also wore a vintage Mickey Mouse t-shirt, another nod that the song ties into her time as Hannah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On her ABC special, she said wearing the t-shirt underneath her one-of-a-kind custom-made Maison Margiela bodysuit by designer John Galliano gets &#8220;the point across of what the song was really about&#8221; as it shows the layers of her life and career.</p>

<p>Fans are wondering if Mindy Kaling quit <em>Inside Out 2</em> &#8230; and, if so, why?</p>



<p>Mindy Kaling is an actress, producer, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/12/mindy-kaling-gives-birth-and-we-know-the-baby-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and even a mom</a>. She is also a voice actor with several memorable roles.</p>



<p>Countless children who don&#8217;t know her from <em>The Mindy Project</em> or <em>The Office</em> recognize her voice from <em>Inside Out</em>.</p>



<p>But Mindy Kaling isn&#8217;t part of the sequel, even though <em>most </em>of the main cast is returning. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-came-back-for-inside-out-2-in-2024">Who came back for &#8216;Inside Out 2&#8217; in 2024?</h2>



<p><em>Inside Out 2</em>, the Pixar film with a June 14 release date, is the long-awaited sequel to 2015&#8217;s <em>Inside Out</em>.</p>



<p>The coming-of-age animated story covers the inner workings of a young girl. A cast of five emotions, each personified, guides her actions as she processes life. (You might think of it as a psychological <em>Osmosis Jones</em>)</p>



<p>Lewis Black returns as Anger for <em>Inside Out 2</em>. Amy Poehler returns as Joy. Phyllis Smith returns as Sadness. But what about Mindy Kaling&#8217;s Disgust and Bill Hader&#8217;s Fear?</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The absence of these two big-name stars from the highly anticipated sequel may be shocking, but it&#8217;s not a surprise.</p>



<p>In the first days of 2023, <em>The Wrap</em> reported that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/is-mindy-kaling-returning-for-inside-out-2-pixar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mindy Kaling would not return</a> as Disgust. Or, rather, that she wasn&#8217;t part of the sequel at the time &#8230; allowing for the <em>potential </em>that Pixar could involve her later during development.</p>



<p>Even at the time of that report, there were rumors that at least some of the cast would not be returning. Why? Over salary disputes, fans believed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mindy-kaling-confirmed-that-she-wasn-t-doing-inside-out-2">Mindy Kaling confirmed that she wasn&#8217;t doing &#8216;Inside Out 2&#8217;</h2>



<p>“I had a great time working on ‘Inside Out’ and am sure ‘Inside Out 2’ will be great,&#8221; Kaling affirmed while speaking to <em>The Wrap</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she clarified, &#8220;I’m not working on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Mindy Kaling used specific language &#8212; stressing that she wasn&#8217;t part of the project &#8220;right now.&#8221; Pixar as a studio is very famous for radically changing projects during production (original plans for <em>Frozen </em>had Elsa as a villain!). Kaling could have theoretically joined the cast in the year-and-a-half between that report and the film&#8217;s release.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that an actor might or might not end up attached to a project is simple: contract negotiations.</p>



<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s about money. That can mean someone&#8217;s direct pay, or licensing issues, or even what promotional obligations they have.</p>



<p>It is perfectly reasonable for an actor to hold out for more pay, especially from a large studio. At the same time, sometimes a studio like Pixar will look at its budget and realize that they can hire talented, less famous voice actors with enough left over to pay <em>multiple </em>animators.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Mindy Kaling in May of 2024." class="wp-image-501161" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0603_mindykaling_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mindy Kaling attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-doesn-t-inside-out-2-include-mindy-kaling-or-bill-hader">Why doesn&#8217;t &#8216;Inside Out 2&#8217; include Mindy Kaling? Or Bill Hader?</h2>



<p>Mindy Kaling, despite being no stranger to speculation and rumor, did not divulge the reason for not returning as Disgust.</p>



<p>It might be easier if Bill Hader publicly explained why he didn&#8217;t come back as Fear. Instead, it remains widely reported and believed that the cause was pay disagreements.</p>



<p>So now, Liza Lapira voices Disgust in the sequel. And Tony Hale (already part of the Pixar family for voicing Forky in <em>Toy Story 4</em>) is stepping up to voice Fear. These are two talented actors with lengthy work histories, and were solid choices to delight audiences.</p>

<p><em>Inside Out 2</em> producer Mark Nielsen spoke to <em>LADbible </em>about <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/film/mindy-kaling-bill-hader-inside-out-2-481786-20240501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaling and Hader&#8217;s departure</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been nine years since that first film, and you try to get their original cast back together, but it doesn&#8217;t always work out,&#8221; he stated vaguely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Man, we love Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling. They&#8217;re always going to be part of this Pixar family,&#8221; Nielsen emphasized diplomatically. &#8220;But we also love Tony Hale, who was also Forky in <em>Toy Story 4,</em> and Liza Lapira.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was doubt that Dwayne &#8216;The Rock&#8217; Johnson would be returning for the <em>Moana </em>sequel.</p>



<p>What can we say except, you&#8217;re welcome!</p>



<p>The Rock is pretty beloved, even when he sometimes realizes too late that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/dwayne-johnson-walks-back-support-of-joe-rogan-my-bad-i-didnt-re/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he&#8217;s a terrible judge of character</a>.</p>



<p>But he&#8217;s also pretty essential to <em>Moana</em>, as he plays a major character &#8212; the demigod, Maui.</p>



<p>In the first trailer for <em>Moana 2,</em> we get to see The Rock return to his beloved Disney character &#8211; and meet a co-star he never encountered in the first movie!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moana-2-trailer-the-rock-returns">Moana 2 Trailer: The Rock Returns!</h2>



<p>Disney released an announcement teaser trailer for <em>Moana 2</em>, an animated sequel to the original film, in February 2024. By the end of May, a more telling trailer was released for fans to enjoy. </p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;This is a call from the ancestors,&#8221; Moana proclaims as she returns to the cavern where she first discovered her boat. She plays the drums to summon help, only to receive a playful interruption from her birdbrained friend, Hei Hei the rooster. </p>



<p>She tells the audience she&#8217;s on a mission to reconnect her people, which includes her reluctant father and a collection of new faces, to the &#8220;entire ocean.&#8221;</p>



<p>By the trailers end, she&#8217;s reunited with her most important ally: Maui, the demigod. He arrives and quickly finds &#8220;boat snacks&#8221; Hei Hei and Pua. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you bring the pig last time?&#8221; he asks!</p>





<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moana-sequels-are-happening-two-in-fact">Moana Sequels Are Happening &#8211; Two, in Fact!</h2>



<p>The film will released on November 27 &#8212; one day before Thanksgiving. That will give most American families a long weekend to see the film.</p>



<p>Now, if this wasn&#8217;t enough <em>Moana</em> for you, additionally, there is a live action<em> </em>adaptation on the horizon. </p>



<p>Reports say that the June 2025 release date may be premature, but it&#8217;s coming one way or the other. Exciting stuff!</p>

<p>As for who is involved in the animated sequel, the director is Dave Derrick Jr. The project features music from Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, Opetaia Foa&#8217;i, and Mark Mancina.</p>



<p>Beyond that &#8230; we know next to nothing about the creative team. Except that obviously  the original cast returned. But that wasn&#8217;t always the case. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-actually-be-returning-in-the-moana-sequels">Will Dwayne &#8216;The Rock&#8217; Johnson actually be returning in the  &#8216;Moana&#8217; sequels?</h2>



<p> <em>Deadline </em>reported last fall that <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/dwayne-johnson-moana-2-1235819876/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson was merely <em>in talks</em></a><em> </em>to reprise his Maui role in <em>Moana 2</em>.</p>



<p>Obviously, talks went well, but there is still no word if The Rock will reprise the role AGAIN for the live action flick. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Auli&#8217;i Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the original film and the sequel, is in talks of her own to return for the live action. So, everything is still a work in progress as well. That summer 2025 date is starting to look far-fetched.</p>

<p>Despite the negotiations, Disney went ahead and teased the upcoming sequel. </p>



<p>One major sign that all parties involved believe that things is that both Johnson and Cravalho shared the trailer with their own followers.</p>



<p>Of course, there may have been a leftover contractual obligation that forced someone&#8217;s hand. Similarly, some would consider the release and sharing of this teaser to be a negotiating tactic. Only time will tell.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disney-is-giving-90s-kids-a-real-flashback">Disney is giving &#8217;90s kids a real flashback</h2>



<p>After the Disney Renaissance reinvigorated the once-struggling company, Disney began to greenlight low-budget sequels to major motion pictures. </p>



<p>These sequels featured new, less famous voice casts and conspicuously simpler animation. Some remain fan favorites, while others make people cringe.</p>



<p>Is Disney repeating old mistakes or capitalizing on recent successes? No matter how well <em>Moana 2</em> does, and whether or not Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson is returning for these <em>Moana </em>sequels, fans will argue over this for years.</p>

<p>Beyoncé’s eldest daughter, Blue Ivy Carter is already a Grammy winner, but now she&#8217;s ready to take on a whole new role: Princess!</p>



<p>On April 29, the trailer for Disney&#8217;s next live-action epic dropped. Fans lost it over the sneak peek incredible visuals, the heart-pounding music, and the cast reveal, which includes Blue AND her mother!</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, they&#8217;re BOTH going to be in this new movie! Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>

<p>Disney&nbsp;debuted the first trailer for Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel/sequel to the 2019 &#8220;photorealistic &#8220;live action&#8221; remake of classic 90&#8217;s animated film, <em>The Lion King.</em></p>



<p>In the trailer, the cast is confirmed for the first time, and many of the original voices from he 2019 flick are returning, like Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, and Beyoncé</p>



<p>But the big surprise? <em><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/mufasa-lion-king-trailer-debuts-exclusively-gma-watch/story?id=89586705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning America</a></em> also revealed that Beyoncé’s daughter joined the cast as Kiara, the daughter of King Samba and Queen Nala.</p>



<p>Daughter of a King and Queen makes her a princess! Show us the lie!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meet-the-new-mufasa">Meet The New Mufasa</h2>



<p>Mufasa promises to share the titular lion’s origin story for the first time, depicting his childhood with his rival brother Scar. Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. will voice the younger versions of Mufasa and Scar, respectively. </p>



<p>Aaron Pierre is a relatively unknown actor, starring in projects like the movie <em>Old</em> and the series, <em>Genius</em>. However, this is just the start of his journey with Disney, as he&#8217;s also poised to be in the revival Marvel movie, <em>Blade</em>. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593-683x1024.jpg" alt="blue ivy" class="wp-image-498777" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986698593.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Blue Ivy Carter is seen onstage during the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy))</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Kelvin Harrison Jr. is also a fairly new actor to the scene, with his credits including films like <em>Luce, Monsters and Men,</em> and <em>It Comes at Night.</em></p>



<p>James Earl Jones voiced Mufasa in both the 1994 original film and 2019 remake. Meanwhile, Jeremy Irons voiced Scar in 1994 and Chiwetel Ejiofor took over&nbsp;in 2019. No official word if James will reprise his role this time. At 93, he may be looking to sit this one out. </p>



<p>Congratulations, Blue! Here&#8217;s hoping this is a start of a franchise for the next generation! </p>

<p>Disney Plus is a heavy hitter in the TV streaming world. Few companies can afford the budget or spectacle of Disney, and they bring that to bear with MCU and Star Wars shows.</p>



<p>Marvel&#8217;s <em>Secret Invasion</em> premiered on Wednesday, June 21. This Skrull-centric adaptation of a famous comics storyline is drawing ire &#8212; but not for its plot or acting.</p>



<p>Instead, it&#8217;s the opening credits. They used &#8220;AI&#8221; software to create the visual sequence instead of human artists.</p>



<p>Social media users are condemning the director, Marvel Studios, and Disney for this controversial move. Among other things &#8230; does this count as <em>plagiarism</em>?</p>

<p>We want to begin by saying that we don&#8217;t claim to know the inner workings of the exact AI learning that Method Studios learned to create the nauseating intro sequence.</p>



<p>But intense anger among social media and reviewers isn&#8217;t about them. They were just doing a job.</p>



<p>As the show&#8217;s own director and executive producer will tell you, they specifically requested this dystopian tech when conjuring up <em>Secret Invasion</em>&#8216;s opening scrawl. (<em>Opening Skrull</em>? Is this anything?)</p>

<p>Ali Selim <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23767640/ai-mcu-secret-invasion-opening-credits">spoke to <em>Polygon</em></a><em> </em>about this sequence, confirming that Method Studios designed it using artificial intelligence.</p>



<p id="6tsNMI">“When we reached out to the AI vendors, that was part of it,&#8221; Selim explained. &#8220;It just came right out of the shape-shifting, Skrull world identity, you know? <em>Who did this? Who is this?</em>”</p>



<p>He admitted that he does not &#8220;really understand&#8221; how this technology works. Apparently, he just thought that it was a neat and tonally appropriate idea.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“We would talk to them about ideas and themes and words,&#8221; Selim described of the process. &#8220;And then the computer would go off and do something.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continued: &#8220;And then we could change it a little bit by using words, and it would change.”</p>



<p>That is also how it works when working with an actual artist. Whether you&#8217;re an individual getting a portrait of your favorite video game <em>blorbo </em>or a company working with VFX, feedback is a key component of the process.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It felt explorative and inevitable, and exciting, and different,&#8221; Selim summarized.</p>



<p>Well, it is certainly different. We would have to be truly cynical to call it <em>inevitable</em>, but perhaps that is simply being <em>realistic </em>at this point. Some genies cannot return to the bottle &#8230; no matter how much damage they do.</p>



<p>To be blunt, judging from commentary from both tech experts and MCU fans, many hope that this sort of abomination will eventually become illegal.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, the most intuitive problem with this is that they could have hired an <em>actual </em>team of artists. You know, humans. (We&#8217;d take Skrull artists, too!)</p>



<p>Ideally, technology should make people&#8217;s lives easier and better. Part of that means replacing human jobs &#8212; but miserable ones. Dangerous jobs. Robots could handle mining, basic construction, sewer maintenance, and more.</p>



<p>Instead, there are some who seem to like the idea of robots replacing humans in creative and artistic industries &#8230; leaving more actual humans to perform the menial and miserable tasks. But that&#8217;s not actually the <em>big </em>issue.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The biggest issue isn&#8217;t that this is an affront to the concept of art itself. Instead, the biggest issue is that AI &#8220;art&#8221; in general does involve real art. Stolen art.</p>



<p>Numerous other sites, including <a href="https://gizmodo.com/secret-invasion-ai-art-opening-credits-marvel-vfx-1850560454">this solid breakdown by <em>Gizmodo</em></a>, touch upon this. A lot of AI software is, as many social media users have described, plagiarism software.</p>



<p>It does not create. This software instead scrawls millions of images and then reproduces it according to key words. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some instances of this plagiarism are so glaring that artists spotted distorted versions of their own signatures on AI &#8220;art.&#8221; Visual arts behemoth Getty engaged in a legal battle over this unlicensed theft.</p>



<p>Now, we here at <em>THG </em>want to emphasize that we do not know how Method Studios went about this. It is possible that they used programs that have never scanned existing, unlicensed art. </p>



<p>If so, then this existential horror was not plagiarism. But without any transparency on the process, people are regarding it with suspicion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are amazing uses for machine learning. Medical diagnostics, troubleshooting, even sophisticated versions of spell check can all improve using this tech.</p>



<p>The concern here, however, is that one of the most powerful entertainment companies in human history is seeking to replace artists with dubious tech.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t think that Selim has some sinister agenda to force artists into food services out of spite or something. It just sounds like Selim &#8212; by his own admission &#8212; does not understand this technology.</p>
