<p>We have some terrible news to report regarding a woman who has already lived an incredible difficult life.</p>



<p>Virginia Giuffre first made headlines when she publicly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/queen-elizabeth-ii-covid-diagnosis-andrew-scandal-prompt-concern/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault</a>.</p>



<p>Now, she&#8217;s revealed that she has just four days to live after being badly injured in a car accident.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-31-at-1.44.10%E2%80%AFPM-1024x519.png" alt="Virginia Giuffre tells her story during an interview with the BBC." class="wp-image-522503"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Virginia Giuffre tells her story during an interview with the BBC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (BBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-virginia-giuffre-claims-doctors-have-given-her-four-days-to-live">Virginia Giuffre claims doctors have given her four days to live</h2>



<p>In an Instagram post that appeared online earlier today, Virginia stunned her followers by revealing that she does not expect to live out the week.</p>



<p>She explained that she&#8217;s in renal failure after nearly being killed in a head-on collision.</p>



<p>&#8220;This year has been the worst start to a new year, but I won’t bore anyone with the details but I think it important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving 110km as we were slowing for a turn that no matter what your car is made of it might as well be a tin can,&#8221; Giuffre captioned the photo below, in which she appears to have suffered serious head injuries.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve gone into kidney renal failure, they’ve given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes,&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;S&#8211;T in one hand and wish in the other &amp; I guarantee it&#8217;s still going to be s&#8211;t at the end of the day. Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life. Godbless you all xx Virginia.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s good news, however, as members of Virginia&#8217;s family expressed hope that she might pull through.</p>



<p>&#8220;Virginia my daughter, I love you and praying for you to get the correct treatment to live a long and healthy life. If there is anything in this world I can do to help you, please let me know. My spirit with you now and holding your hand,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DH0vvDKzDvu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her father commented on the post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-life-marred-by-unfathomable-trauma">A life marred by unfathomable trauma</h2>



<p>Giuffre says that she met the infamous sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort. She claims that Epstein introduced her to Andrew in 1999, while she was still in her teens.</p>

<p>Giuffre alleges that Andrew forced her to have sex with him three times between 1999 and 2002.</p>



<p>After Virginia came forward, a photo showing her and Epstein standing alongside his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, circulated online.</p>



<p>She told the <em><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article219494920.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami Herald</a></em> that Epstein lost interest in her in 2003, when she was 20, because she was &#8220;too old.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/07/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epsteins-confidante-arrested-by-fbi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence</a> on sex trafficking charges.</p>



<p>Andrew has not been charged with any crime, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/prince-andrew-to-face-sexual-assault-accuser-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giuffre did file a civil suit against him</a> in 2021.</p>



<p>After months of legal wrangling, the two parties reached a settlement “in principle” in early 2022. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>King Charles and Prince Andrew have always had a complicated relationship.</p>



<p>In recent years, the main point of contention has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/prince-william-kate-middleton-support-decision-to-evict-harry-meghan-wed-rather-live-next-door-to-sex-offender-prince-andrew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew&#8217;s numerous scandals</a>, including his involvement with infamous sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p>But the rift appears to be less serious than the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/prince-william-bans-prince-harry-from-family-functions-in-spite-of-king-charles-wishes-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feud between Prince William and Prince Harry</a>. After all, Charles and Andrew are still on speaking terms.</p>

<p>That said, the monarch and his black sheep younger brother have been butting heads for years. And it seems that the situation is now coming to a head thanks to a dispute over housing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-king-charles-is-trying-to-evict-prince-andrew">King Charles Is Trying to Evict Prince Andrew</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/entertainment/prince-andrew-shoving-two-fingers-up-at-king-charles-dishonoring-royals-over-royal-lodge-standoff-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a></em>, Charles has been strongly urging Andrew to vacate his current residence, the Royal Lodge on the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>



<p>Andrew currently lives there with his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, and it seems the exes lack the necessary income to maintain the property.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="711" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-71247161-711x1024.jpg" alt="Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales arrive for the first day of Royal Ascot 2006, at Ascot Racecourse on June 20, 2006 in Ascot, England.

<p>Charles has proposed that they move out of the 31-room property and relocate to the much smaller Frogmore Cottage.</p>



<p>(You might remember that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle used to claim Frogmore as their own before they were <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/king-charles-of-course-i-booted-harry-and-meghan-from-frogmore-cottage-they-deserved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evicted by Charles</a>.)</p>



<p>But Andrew&#8217;s lack of income is due largely to the fact that Charles has tightened the royal purse strings.</p>



<p>He now views the king&#8217;s eviction attempt as another public humiliation. And it seems he&#8217;s drawn a line in the sand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-brotherly-dispute">A Brotherly Dispute</h2>



<p>According to royal expert Christopher Wilson, the situation is much more serious than a simple dispute over housing.</p>



<p>He believes that by refusing to vacate the house that was formerly home to the Queen Mother, Andrew is showing tremendous disrespect to his late grandmother.</p>



<p>“It’s dishonoring [the Queen Mother’s] memory,” Wilson recently told <em><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/31493383/prince-andrew-king-charles-fortune-money-royal-lodge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>.</p>



<p>“It’s shoving up two fingers at King Charles. The state of his mind is reflected in the state of his home.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1425178012-1024x683.jpg" alt="King Charles III, Anne, Princess Royal and Prince Andrew, Duke of York watch on as The Queen's funeral cortege borne on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy as it departs Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022 in London, England.

<p>Wilson says that Andrew&#8217;s disregard for his family is evidenced by the house&#8217;s disrepair.</p>



<p>“It is falling all around him,” said the journalist. “He doesn’t care anymore.”</p>



<p>But Charles does care, and he might soon double down in his efforts to convince his brother to downsize.</p>

<p>As we previously stated, Charles is no stranger to familial evictions. Amid great controversy, he removed Harry and Meghan from Frogmore last year, just one day before the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s memoir</a>.</p>



<p>With multiple sexual assault allegations against him, Andrew has certainly brought greater shame to the family.</p>



<p>And polls indicate that he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-who-is-the-most-popular-royal-of-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the least popular royal</a> by a significant margin.</p>



<p>But Charles has always seemed to have a soft spot for his brother. So don&#8217;t be surprised if this dispute drags on for a while.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/queen-elizabeth-ii-dies-at-96-prince-charles-becomes-king-of-the-united-kingdom/">passing of Queen Elizabeth II</a>, critics of the monarchy on social media became targets for shaming.</p>



<p>The monarchy, people argued, is purely symbolic. They&#8217;re <em>expensive </em>mascots, but other than that, don&#8217;t <em>harm </em>anyone. Right?</p>



<p>But in recent days, UK police arrested four people for criticizing royals.</p>



<p>One of the targets was a heckler who called Prince Andrew a &#8220;sick old man&#8221; before police seized him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>One of Prince Andrew&#8217;s accusers recently filed a civil suit against him. And it looks as though the prince will soon be forced to stand trial.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the Queen gone, <em>nobody </em>likes Prince Andrew.</p>



<p>The accused sexual predator can apparently buy his way out of consequences using his family&#8217;s hoarded wealth.</p>



<p>He cannot buy his way out of criticism, however. Apparently, silencing his detractors is a job for police.</p>

The disgraced son of Queen Elizabeth has been stripped of his royal titles and charities.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Andrew, you&#8217;re a sick old man!&#8221; a Scottish heckler yelled during Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s funeral procession on Monday.</p>



<p>The royal procession was escorting the coffin to Scotland&#8217;s St. Giles&#8217; Cathedral.</p>



<p>The onlooker, reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/janderson_news/status/1569328330847191041">a young man named Rory</a>, also added: &#8220;Disgusting!&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>A police officer and others in the crowd apparently pulled the heckler away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oy, I&#8217;ve done nothing wrong!&#8221; he announced.</p>



<p>True though that may be, police did not stop at silencing him. They also <em>arrested </em>him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Queen Elizabeth II stripped Prince Andrew of both his royal and military titles earlier this year.</p>



<p>The move, which she made in January, came only after years of campaigning. Various municipalities had already taken symbolic moves against the fallen Duke of York.</p>



<p>In this case, of course, it was to ensure that Andrew would be defending himself in a sexual assault lawsuit as a private citizen. He ended up paying out a $10 million settlement in the matter.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, this Scottish heckler was only one of the arrests surrounding the monarchy.</p>



<p>One was a 74-year-old in Edinburgh. Another was a woman who held up a sign that read: &#8220;Abolish the Monarchy.&#8221;</p>



<p>And a man in Oxford simply called out a question: &#8220;Who elected him?&#8221; </p>

<p>Social media cannot help but marvel at the bizarre power that these withered parasites wield.</p>



<p>The royal family is <em>not </em>just a publicly funded, unmoisturized Kardashian family. No one has faced arrest for criticizing Kris Jenner. So far.</p>



<p>It is nauseating to see police protect Andrew from critics. The monarchy has outlived any use that it may have had.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When <a href="/2022/05/queen-to-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-you-can-come-to-my-jubil/">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were invited to the Platinum Jubilee</a> by Queen Elizabeth, many hoped that the occasion would provide an opportunity for the warring factions of the royal family to finally bury the hatchet.</p>
<p>Of course, there were those who hoped that the four days of international scrutiny would expose the dysfunction and hostility within the Windsor clan.</p>
<p>Many of the so-called journalists who make up the British tabloid press were members of the latter group of embittered trolls.</p>
<p>These people used to disguise their contempt for Meghan as concern for the Queen and the Crown, but many of them let their masks slip over the past week by rooting for the Jubilee to be a disaster.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/06/meghan-and-harry-at-the-jubilee.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-448813"/></figure></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t, of course, but the worst of the bunch are currently inventing disasters and placing the blame on Meghan.</p>
<p>The chief hater is Dan Wootton of <em>The Daily Mail</em>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-10889737/DAN-WOOTTON-Glorious-Jubilee-shown-gulf-Sussexes-royals-larger-ever.html">who claims</a> that the royals were appalled by Meghan&#8217;s behavior last week.</p>
<p>In fact, Wootton claims, the Queen and company were so put off by Meghan&#8217;s &quot;detached&quot; aloofness that they now think she&#8217;s a bigger detriment to the family name than Prince Andrew.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;re talking about the same <a href="/2022/02/prince-andrew-buys-off-sexual-assault-victim-with-queens-money/">Prince Andrew who paid off his sexual assault victim </a>with money he borrowed from the Queen.</p>
<p>Dan Wootton is trying to sell the story that the royals prefer<em> that guy</em> to Meghan.</p>
<p>So yeah, either Wootton is seriously depraved or the royals are. Perhaps both!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned some members of the Royal Family and many senior courtiers were horrified at the detached and cold appearance by the exiled couple, who had also made the decision to fly out of the country before the Queen had even made her historic Buckingham Palace balcony appearance, alongside Charles, Camilla and the Cambridges, on Sunday evening,&quot; he wrote in his latest column for the <em>Mail</em>.</p>
<p>According to Wootton, guests were promised that members of the Royal Family would be waiting around Buckingham Palace &quot;to mingle and chat&quot; with them during one event.</p>
<p>Disappointed guests who were left without a royal with which to hobnob &quot;were told by organisers it was because the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had turned down an invitation to attend.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Apparently, this is an offense on par with the many atrocities that Andrew has been accused of.</p>
<p>&quot;Prince Andrew is less of a pariah than Harry and Meghan as far as the family are concerned,&quot; one unnamed &quot;royal insider&quot; allegedly told Wootton,</p>
<p>&quot;The public might be surprised, but within the family it is seen as if he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. They have to believe that.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andrew and Queen" class="wp-image-412783" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Wootton also faults Harry and Meghan for flying home on Sunday afternoon instead of remaining through the official conclusion of the Jubilee.</p>
<p>Again, this is apparently worse than making numerous trips to Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s sex-trafficking island, as Andrew did.</p>
<p>Now that they&#8217;re home, it seems that Harry and Meghan still have not escaped the long reach of the royal microscope.</p>

<p>&quot;Courtiers are now watching closely to see if Harry and Meghan release any pictures of their weekend in the UK, especially their meeting with the Queen, in the coming weeks or months,&quot; Wootton writes.</p>
<p>Jeez, considering the royals think Harry and Meghan are worse than a literal sex criminal, you&#8217;d find a way to get over being so obsessed with the Sussexes!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Success can only be measured in relative terms.</p>
<p>Sure, a guy who lives in a palace and is married to a literal princess might <em>sound</em> like he&#8217;s wildly successful, but if the same dude had six royal titles and a full crew of servants before he learned to walk, then his situation as a grown up is a little less impressive, <em>innit</em>?</p>
<p>So when we call Prince Charles and his siblings losers, we&#8217;re not blindly hurling the Trumpian L-word at some undeserving targets who have actually accomplished a great deal.</p>
<p>No, by the only metric that matters &#8212; namely, the effort an individual puts into availing themselves of the talents and opportunities that are presented to them &#8212; the Queen&#8217;s kids deserve the loser label at least as much as their various lord- and ladyships.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andrew and Queen" class="wp-image-412783" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>And apparently, the Queen is well aware that she birthed a crop of failsons (and one daughter).</p>
<p>Author Robert Hardman has written a new biography of QE2 titled&nbsp;<em>Queen of Our Times: The Life of Queen Elizabeth II</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://people.com/royals/queen-elizabeth-struggled-privately-with-the-divorces-of-prince-charles-prince-andrew-and-princess-anne/">new excerpt </a>published by <em>Peoole</em> magazine, Hardman claims that the Queen has been known to lapse into depression when she considers that three of her four children have gotten divorced.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Outwardly stoical, as ever, the Queen was finding the divorce talks deeply upsetting,&quot; Hardman writes.</p>
<p>&quot;Another former member of the Household recalls that, every now and then, there would be a glimpse of her despair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It distressed her much more than she let on,&quot; a former staffer reportedly told Hardman.</p>

<p>&quot;I said, &#8216;Ma&#8217;am, it seems to be happening everywhere. This is almost common practice.&#8217; But she just said, &#8216;Three out of four!&#8217; in sheer sadness and exasperation. One shouldn&#8217;t underestimate the pain she&#8217;s been through.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, it seems that the Queen was quite upset about the fact that her children encountered so many marital difficulties.</p>
<p>We would have thought that she would be more upset about the fact that <a href="/2022/02/prince-andrew-buys-off-sexual-assault-victim-with-queens-money/">Prince Andrew recently settled his sexual assault case</a> out of court with money he borrowed from the Crown.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>But maybe that&#8217;s a generational/cultural difference between mere mortals and centenarian monarchs.</p>
<p>Through all the ups and downs of her many, many years on the throne, however, Liz has maintained the stiffest of upper lips.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t remember a single occasion when I went to see her and she exclaimed, &#8216;No! What next?&#8217; &quot; her former press secretary Charles Anson told Hardman.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;The issue was sometimes embarrassing, but she got on with it. It is immensely reassuring in those situations to work for someone who isn&#8217;t knocked back.&quot;</p>
<p>Hardman says the Queen learned her approach to difficult times from her father, George VI, best known to Americans as homie from that <em>King&#8217;s Speech</em> movie.</p>
<p>&quot;Her mother&#8217;s strategy in these situations&mdash; to carry on as if they were not happening&mdash;had earned her the nickname &#8216;imperial ostrich&#8217; among royal staff,&quot; Hardman writes.</p>

<p>&quot;The Queen&#8217;s response, as ever, was to follow the example of her father, absorbed from his days at sea, and to treat adversity like the ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Storms will come and go, some worse than others,&quot; says former UK prime minister Sir John Major of the Queen&#8217;s mentality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But she will always put her head down and plough through them. The Queen has always lived by the doctrine, &#8216;This too shall pass,&quot; Major recalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;While the Queen has sometimes been accused of being slow to act, there has never been a charge of panic. Her default mode in the face of a crisis is stillness,&quot; Hardman writes.</p>
<p>Well, that stillness has certainly been on display in recent years amid the Andrew scandal and <a href="/2020/01/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-stepped-down-due-to-bad-blood-amo/">Harry and Meghan&#8217;s decision to step down</a>&nbsp;from their roles as senior members of the royal family.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the Elizabeth&#8217;s chronically inert children seem to have learned a little too well from that example!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When Virginia Giuffre first accused Prince Andrew of rape, many assumed that the Queen&#8217;s youngest son would settle out of court for a large sum of money.</p>
<p>When that didn&#8217;t happen, media outlets took a closer look at Andrew&#8217;s finances and concluded that he probably didn&#8217;t have the funds to bail himself out of this situation.</p>
<p>So while the latest news out of Buckingham Palace is downright nauseating, it&#8217;s certainly not surprising:</p>
<p>As many predicted, it seems that Andrew has settled out of court using Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s money.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andrew and Queen" class="wp-image-412783" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2022/02/15/queen-help-pay-12m-prince-andrew-settlement/">new report</a> from UK newspaper <em>The Telegraph</em>, &quot;the Duke of York will pay his accuser more than &pound;12 million using money from the Queen.&quot;</p>
<p>The payout is the equivalent to $13.5 million USD.</p>
<p>Andrew was reportedly forced to pony up some of the cash on his own, but recent estimates put his net worth at somewhere between $3-5 million, meaning he couldn&#8217;t come to close to affording the settlement on his own.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>News of the settlement comes just weeks after <a href="/2022/01/prince-andrew-stripped-of-titles-charities-by-queen-elizabeth/">Andrew was stripped of his military titles</a> and charities.</p>
<p>The move was taken by many as an indication that the Queen was fed up with Andrew, that she had decided to finally withdraw the support she had offered him throughout his scandal-plagued life.</p>
<p>Royal watchers hoped that the Queen had cut Andrew loose and would force him to answer for his alleged crimes in court.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In the end, however, the Queen saved her son from the humiliation of a jury trial with a massive infusion of cash.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible that she was less concerned with Andrew&#8217;s well-being than with the longterm reputation of the royal family.</p>
<p>Many have pointed out that the settlement comes amid an important celebration for the Queen.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Insiders tell <em>The Daily Mirror </em>that palace officials were keen to ensure that Andrew&#8217;s legal troubles would not &ldquo;overshadow the Queen&rsquo;s Platinum Jubilee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those same sources tell the <em>Mirror</em> that Andrew still &ldquo;wholly maintains his innocence&rdquo; and insist that he &ldquo;believes he can still find a way back into public life.&quot;</p>
<p>If the last part is true, then Andrew is more delusional than we thought, and you can be certain that he&#8217;s the only one who thinks he can ever return to public life.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>This week&#8217;s news is obviously massively disappointing for fans of the Queen, as it seems she&#8217;s unconcerned about <a href="/2021/12/meghan-markle-could-testify-against-prince-andrew-demolish-him-d/">Andrew&#8217;s relationshio with Jeffrey Epstein</a> or the fact that he seems to have played an active role in the world&#8217;s most infamous human trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Rather, she decided to help her son avoid any consequences yet again.</p>
<p>Insiders say that even the decision to <a href="/2022/02/camilla-parker-bowles-hated-meghan-markle-from-the-start-sources/">promote Camilla Parker Bowles to Queen Consort</a> (a title that she&#8217;ll assume after Prince Charles takes the throne) may have been motivated by a desire to draw the public&#8217;s attention away from Andrew&#8217;s legal situation.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The only silver lining to be found in this dark cloud of scandal and graft is the fact that Mrs. Giuffre will finally receive the sizable payout she deserves.</p>
<p>Of course, more good may come of the situation if it leads the citizens of the UK to conclude that the British Royal Family is broken beyond repair and should be done away with as an institution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>As media interest in the <a href="/2021/12/meghan-markle-could-testify-against-prince-andrew-demolish-him-d/">allegations against Prince Andrew</a> intensifies, Buckingham Palace finally took action today by enacting mild disciplinary measures against the accused sexual predator.</p>
<p>According to an announcement issued on Thursday the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth has been stripped of his military titles and charities.</p>
<p>The news is being interpreted as an indication that the Queen and family will no support or defend Andrew as <a href="/2021/09/prince-andrew-to-face-sexual-assault-accuser-in-court/">Virginia Giuffre&#8217;s civil case</a> against him goes to trial.</p>
<p>Giuffre alleges that she was forced into sex slavery by the infamous predator Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have intercourse with Andrew when she was just 17.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>&quot;With The Queen&#8217;s approval and agreement, the Duke of York&#8217;s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to The Queen,&quot; today&#8217;s statement reads.</p>
<p>&quot;The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement goes on to clarify that Andrew will not have his titles returned to him, no matter the outcome of the trial.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andrew and Queen" class="wp-image-412783" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-735x490.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-335x223.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-347x231.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-520x347.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/andrew-and-queen.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;All of the Duke&#8217;s roles have been handed back to the Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other members of the Royal Family,&quot; says a palace spokesperson.</p>
<p>&quot;For clarity, they will not return to The Duke of York.&quot;</p>
<p>While this may seem like a half-measure &#8212; Andrew is still a prince, after all, and no one in his family has come out to condemn his actions &#8212; it&#8217;s significant in that it&#8217;s the first indication the royals have given that they believe Andrew is not 100 percent innocent.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also the latest in a long line of setbacks for Andrew.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a judge denied Andrew&#8217;s request to throw Giuffre&#8217;s case out of court on a series of technicalities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ms. Giuffre&rsquo;s complaint is neither &lsquo;unintelligible&rsquo; nor &lsquo;vague&rsquo; nor &lsquo;ambiguous,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Judge Lewis Kaplan, throwing Andrew&#8217;s attorneys own words back at them.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The judge also ruled that a 2009 settlement, in which Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the charges against him, could not be used to protect Andrew from legal action.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/09/prince-andrew-to-face-sexual-assault-accuser-in-court/">Andrew has been served with a subpoena</a>, but it remains unclear if he&#8217;ll show up in court.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no extradition for civil suits, so it&#8217;s possible that he&#8217;ll simply remain in the UK and allow the case to be decided in his absence.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The best way for him to avoid additional negative press would be to offer a cash settlement, but as<em> The Daily Beast</em> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/prince-andrew-has-three-options-he-loses-whatever-he-does?ref=scroll">points out</a>, Andrew might not be in a position to do so.</p>
<p>While the exact state of his finances is uncertain, it&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;s less well-off than most members of his wealthy family.</p>
<p>As a wedding present from his mother, Andrew was given a palace,&nbsp;Sunninghill Park, which he proceeded to sell to a Kazakh billionaire in a highly suspicious deal.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The money from that sale is believed to have gone toward the purchase of a $22 million Swiss ski chalet, which Andrew is now in talks to sell, reportedly for a fraction of the original price.</p>
<p>Insiders say Andrew and ex-wife Sarah Ferguson have only about $4 million equity in the property.</p>
<p>If he&#8217;s unable to settle, Andrew will be forced to either fight the case or refuse to participate in any way, which would result in a default judgment.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Default judgments against non-US citizens are notoriously difficult to collect, but this option would be devastating to Andrew&#8217;s reputation and future prospects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think he will do that. The consequences would be just too severe,&quot; says a source close to Giuffre.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you imagine a situation where the king&rsquo;s brother is a debt fugitive? He would never be able to own anything again for the rest of his life,&quot; the insider adds.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;If there is a trial, and he loses, and whatever amount the judge awards&ndash;maybe it gets paid and maybe it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;at least it is over with, it is behind them. If he defaults it goes on forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Andrew&#8217;s outlook is rather bleak indeed.</p>
<p>And it sounds as though his family is planning to continue distancing themselves from the royal black sheep.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Long-disgraced royal family member <a href="/2021/09/prince-andrew-to-face-sexual-assault-accuser-in-court/">Prince Andrew is going to court</a>.</p>
<p>At least, he is being sued. It is not yet clear if the case will go to trial.</p>
<p>The attorney hoping to crush him in a court of law has shared plans to call in Duchess Meghan Markle for a deposition.</p>
<p>The reason? She is perhaps the only member of the royal family likely to tell the unfiltered truth on the stand.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>David Boies is the attorney representing Virginia Roberts Giuffre.</p>
<p>Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was only 17 years old.</p>
<p>Andrew has vehemently denied any and all wrongdoing, as expected.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Boies spoke to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/meghan-markle-may-be-deposed-in-virginia-roberts-giuffre-lawsuit-against-prince-andrew-david-boies-says"><em>The Daily Beast</em></a> about potential plans should the lawsuit go to trial.</p>
<p>It is possible that Duchess <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/meghan-markle-reveals-suicidal-thoughts-in-stunning-new-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="141">Meghan Markle</a> could be deposed during the course of the case.</p>
<p>There are, Boies explained, three good reasons to involve Meghan and her testimony.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1005" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-1005x1024.jpg" alt="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on CBS" class="wp-image-57724" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-1005x1024.jpg 1005w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-768x783.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-1507x1536.jpg 1507w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-2010x2048.jpg 2010w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-735x749.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-329x335.jpg 329w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-341x347.jpg 341w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-510x520.jpg 510w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-628x640.jpg 628w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-754x768.jpg 754w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-942x960.jpg 942w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-on-cbs-1060x1080.jpg 1060w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Harpo Productions/Joe Pugliese via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The first reason for deposing the Duchess of Sussex is the simplest.</p>
<p>&quot;One; she is in the U.S.,&quot; Boies noted.</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; the attorney explained, &quot;we have jurisdiction over her.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Two; she is somebody who obviously, at least for a period of time, was a close associate of Prince Andrew,&quot; Boies continued.</p>
<p>&quot;And hence is in a position to perhaps have seen what he did,&quot; the attorney reasoned.</p>
<p>&quot;And perhaps,&quot; Boies went on, &quot;if not to have seen what he did, to have heard people talk about it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Because of her past association with him,&quot; Boies&#8217; explanation went on.</p>
<p>&quot;She may very well have important knowledge,&quot; the lawyer suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; Boies affirmed, &quot;will certainly have some knowledge.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Three; she is somebody who we can count on to tell the truth,&quot; Boies noted.</p>
<p>It is true that, outside of certain very toxic circles that are primarily in the U.K., Meghan Markle is well-regarded and seen as trustworthy.</p>
<p>&quot;She checks all three boxes,&quot; Boies concluded.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Before testifying, in a deposition or on the witness stand, one swears to tell the truth and the whole truth.</p>
<p>If that is not enough, perjury is also a criminal offense.</p>
<p>However, for some members of the royal family, their ingrained sense of duty to their farcical role in politics and history could be more important.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Meghan, however, is widely considered to be an earnest, trustworthy person.</p>
<p>If the lawsuit were taking place in a British court, she might not be an ideal witness because of the twisted prejudices against her.</p>
<p>But her image in America (and most of the world) is such that Boies and any potential jury would likely take her words into consideration.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="897" height="952" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah.jpg" alt="Meghan Markle with Oprah" class="wp-image-402559" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah.jpg 897w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-283x300.jpg 283w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-768x815.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-735x780.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-316x335.jpg 316w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-327x347.jpg 327w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-490x520.jpg 490w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-603x640.jpg 603w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-with-oprah-724x768.jpg 724w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(YouTube/CBS)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Boies also expresed a desire to depose other members of the royal family.</p>
<p>On a less famous note, the Duke of York&#8217;s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson would ideally be on any witness list.</p>
<p>So would Andrew&#8217;s siblings &#8230; including Prince Charles, the future King of England.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>However, Boies emphasized that there were no plans to even attempt to depose Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
<p>He explained that this is&nbsp;&quot;out of respect and deference, and her age.&quot;</p>
<p>The Queen is 95 and her reported health problems and lack of visibility have <a href="/2021/12/queen-elizabeth-ii-dead-conspiracy-theorists-suspect-palace-cove/">conspiracy theorists speculating that she&#8217;s secretly dead</a> already.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="855" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-855x1024.jpg" alt="The Queen Remembers" class="wp-image-313900" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-855x1024.jpg 855w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-251x300.jpg 251w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-768x920.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-1283x1536.jpg 1283w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-1710x2048.jpg 1710w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-735x880.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-280x335.jpg 280w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-290x347.jpg 290w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-434x520.jpg 434w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-534x640.jpg 534w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-641x768.jpg 641w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-802x960.jpg 802w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/the-queen-remembers-902x1080.jpg 902w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>As for the lawsuit itself, Giuffre alleges that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times.</p>
<p>These three assaults took place between 1999 and 2002 in London, in New York, and on a private Caribbean island.</p>
<p>Yes, the island is owned by the infamous and now dead Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Prince Andrew has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>There is photographic evidence, highlighted previously by BBC Newsnight anchor Emily Maitlis, that he met Giuffre.</p>
<p>There is a photo of the disgraced prince with his arm around Giuffre&#8217;s waist, believed to have been taken inside the home of Ghislaine Maxwell when Giuffre was 17.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Prince Andrew is in the news this week, and as usual, the coverage is resulting in some royal headaches for his long-suffering family,</p>
<p>As you&#8217;re probably, <a href="/2019/11/prince-andrew-addresses-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-digs-himself-an/">Andrew stands accused of statutory rape</a>, having allegedly engaged in sexual acts with several underage victims of Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s human trafficking ring.</p>
<p>For months, the prince managed to dodge subpoenas, but he was finally served on August 27, and soon,&nbsp;<a href="/2021/09/prince-andrew-to-face-sexual-assault-accuser-in-court/">Andrew will soon be forced to face one of his accusers in court</a>.</p>
<p>An expired statute of limitations will likely prevent Andrew from facing any criminal charges, but a civil suit filed by alleged victim Virginia Roberts will force him to answer for his crimes in front of a judge.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Roberts says she was forced to have sex with Andrew three times between 1999 and 2002.</p>
<p>She was just 17 years old at the time of the first encounter, and while the age of consent in the UK is 16, Roberts says she was illegally trafficked from her home in California, where the age of consent is 18.</p>
<p>We probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that the royal family has been embroiled in scandal for most of the past three years, and for Prince William &#8212; who has become the de facto public face of the institution &#8212; Andrews&#8217; legal woes couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>And according to a <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrew-william-jeffrey-epstein-virginia-giuffre-royal-family-l7xwt7lmc">new report </a>from the UK&#8217;s Sunday Times, William would like nothing more than to never hear his uncle&#8217;s name again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William is no fan of Uncle Andrew,&quot; one insider tells the outlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no way in the world he&rsquo;s ever coming back, the family will never let it happen.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Yes, while Andrew seems to believe that he can somehow weather this storm, William is reportedly well aware that regardless of what happens in court, Andrew&#8217;s goose is cooked.</p>
<p>And according to the source, what really &quot;triggers&rdquo; William is his uncle&rsquo;s perceived &ldquo;ungracious and ungrateful&rdquo; attitude.</p>
<p>William reportedly feels that Andrew&#8217;s sense of privilege is &ldquo;a risk&rdquo; and &ldquo;threat to the family.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>At a time when many UK citizens are questioning the necessity of the royal family, a sexual predator who feels he&#8217;s superior to the average Briton is not exactly great for optics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any suggestion that there isn&rsquo;t gratitude for the institution, anything that could lead anyone in the public to think that senior members of the royal family aren&rsquo;t grateful for their position, [William thinks] is really dangerous,&rdquo; the source said.</p>
<p>And it seems that William is not alone in his distaste for Prince Charles&#8217; younger brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not made any friends on the way up, so no one is helping him on the way down,&quot; one source told the Times.</p>
<p>Another insider labeled Andrew &ldquo;a self-important bore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no time for Andrew. He&rsquo;s a total dickhead, an arrogant sh-t,&rdquo; an anonymous military source told the newspaper</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s quite an arrogant chap with a tendency to blame other people when things go wrong, instead of looking at his own behavior,&quot; another unnamed insider added.</p>
<p>&quot;The Duke of York has never been one to take advice that doesn&rsquo;t suit him, and he doesn&rsquo;t hold back in letting you know what to do with that advice that he doesn&rsquo;t want to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a deeply unpleasant man,&rdquo; a former aide told the Times.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;The difference you see between him and the way Prince William and the Prince of Wales treat their staff with respect, straight out of the Queen&rsquo;s handbook, is stark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remarkably, it seems that Andrew still feels he has a future in the public eye.</p>
<p>Those around him, meanwhile, have grown weary of this particular delusion.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;No business or brand in the country would touch him,&rdquo; said one royal source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should go and manage one of the royal estates, or do something within the royal set-up that provides him with an entirely private role,&quot; the insider added.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to come to terms with a position as a private member of the royal family and stop trying to get back what he once had. He has to embrace a different role for the rest of his life. That will probably crush him, but he has to come to terms with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither William or Charles is yet in a position to force Andrew from his post.</p>
<p>But it sounds like the Duke of York would do well to step down before either of them takes the throne.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been a year of scandal for the British Royal Family, and just as the dust is finally beginning to settle from <a href="/2021/08/thomas-markle-meghan-and-oprah-are-not-friends/">Meghan Markle&#8217;s Oprah interview</a>, that sizable controversy is about to be dwarfed by a lawsuit that threatens to put the entire institution on trial.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew &#8212; the son of Queen Elizabeth and brother of Prince Charles &#8212; has long been tabloid fodder overseas.</p>
<p>In the States, we mostly forgot about him following his marriage to Sarah Ferguson &#8212; that is, until <a href="/2019/11/prince-andrew-addresses-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-digs-himself-an/">Andrew was linked to Jeffrey Epstein</a> and shown to be a regular passenger on the infamous rapist&#8217;s private jet.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/11/prince-andrew-steps-down-in-disgrace-after-jeffrey-epstein-inter/">Andrew stepped down</a> from his role as a senior member of the family in 2019, and his royal relatives hoped that the many accusations of sexual assault against the 61-year-old would disappear along with him.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t happened.</p>
<p>Currently, Andrew is facing a civil suit from a woman named&nbsp;Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims he forced her to have sex with him three times between 1999 and 2002.</p>
<p>Now, in what must surely be a nightmare scenario for the royals, Giuffre&#8217;s case has gone to trial, with the proceedings beginning on Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-andrew-first-hearing-virginia-roberts-giuffre-lawsuit/">According to</a> People magazine, a virtual hearing was held yesterday, but Andrew was not in attendance.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>No great surprise there, as the prince has been doing his best to avoid being involved in the trial in any way.</p>
<p>Until recently, he had successfully hidden from process servers, who were unable to issue a subpoena due to their inability to locate Andrew.</p>
<p>That cat-and-mouse game came to an end on August 27, when Andrew finally received his court summons.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Giuffre is American and she filed her suit in New York City.</p>
<p>But despite the fact that the virtual hearing removed the necessity of traveling between countries, Andrew was still absent from the proceedings.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is clear that Prince Andrew has actual notice of this complaint and proceeding,&quot;&nbsp;Giuffre&#8217;s lawyer David Boies told Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Despite the prince&#8217;s absence, Andrew&#8217;s legal team came out in full force for the hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe, however, that this is a baseless, non-viable and potentially unlawful lawsuit that the Plaintiff has filed against the Duke,&quot; said one Andrew&#8217;s attorneys.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a settlement agreement that the Plaintiff has settled into in a prior action that releases the Duke and others from any and all potential liability.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Yes, they&#8217;re claiming Andrew&#8217;s innocence while at the same time asking for a previous settlement to be unsealed in order to prove that Giuffre has been paid off.</p>
<p>Nothing suspicious about that!</p>
<p>In a statement issued to People last month, Giuffre made it clear that she&#8217;s not after Andrew&#8217;s money but is instead hoping that some modicum of justice will be served.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I am holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me. The powerful and rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions,&quot; she told the outlet.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that other victims will see that it is possible not to live in silence and fear, but to reclaim one&#8217;s life by speaking out and demanding justice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The filing of this complaint proves that irrespective of power, privilege or even being a prince, no one is above the law in the United States and all perpetrators of abuse should be held accountable,&quot; says Giuffre&#8217;s attorney Sigrid McCawley.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Andrew, meanwhile, continues to deny ever meeting Giuffre at all.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever. It just never happened,&quot; he said in a 2019 interview.</p>
<p>So Andrew claims he previously settled with Giuffre despite never having met her.</p>
<p>Something tells us the Queen is feeling mighty nervous this week.</p>
