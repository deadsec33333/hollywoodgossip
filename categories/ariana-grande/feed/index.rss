<p>We knew that Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo would be in attendance at tonight&#8217;s Academy Awards.</p>



<p>After all, they&#8217;re both nominated for their performances in last year&#8217;s adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wicked</a></em>.</p>



<p>What we <em>didn&#8217;t</em> know is that they would open the show with an unforgettable musical number.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-and-cynthia-give-wicked-fans-exactly-what-they-came-for">Ariana and Cynthia give &#8216;Wicked&#8217; fans exactly what they came for</h2>



<p>Was it the most epic Oscars opening of all time?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll leave that to social media users to decide. What&#8217;s <em>not</em> in question is the fact that Ariana and Cyntia absolutely crushed it.</p>



<p>As you may recall, the bond between the co-stars was evident throughout their <em>Wicked</em> press tour.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-520457" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202907561-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-unforgettable-opening-number-courtesy-of-two-beloved-stars">An unforgettable opening number, courtesy of two beloved stars</h2>



<p>And their professional chemistry was on full display throughout tonight&#8217;s performance, which started with Ariana belting out &#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&#8221;</p>



<p>From there, we were treated to a medley of <em>Wicked</em>&#8216;s most beloved tunes.</p>



<p>It was a moment that&#8217;s certain to go down in Oscars history.</p>



<p>And it was a perfect way to set the stage for Hollywood&#8217;s biggest night.</p>

<p>It was an instance of two immensely talented stars defying gravity together.</p>

<p>Lily Jay has broken her silence on a subject matter that is both very personal and quite public.</p>



<p>As most <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/">celebrity gossip</a> fans know at this point, Jay is divorced from Ethan Slater, an actor who plays the character of Boq in the smash hit, Oscar-nominated film <em>Wicked</em>.</p>



<p>The couple split in 2023, right around the same time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/ariana-grande-divorce/">Ariana Grande divorced Dalton Gomez</a>.</p>



<p>Grande is now dating Slater, with rumors swirling over when, exactly, the co-stars started their relationship.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515543" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2184843216-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande, Bowen Yang and Ethan Slater attend the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; New York Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on November 14, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I really never thought I would get divorced. Especially not just after giving birth to my first child and especially not in the shadow of my husband’s new relationship with a celebrity,&#8221; wrote Jay in an essay for <em>The Cut.</em></p>



<p>Jay and Slater are parents to a two-year old son.</p>



<p>In her very personal essay, the clinical psychologist never cites Grande by name.</p>



<p>But she talks openly about what it&#8217;s been like to see her name in tabloid headlines, along with endless chatter over her ex and one of the country&#8217;s most famous celebrities.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on November 14, 2024." class="wp-image-514679" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; New York Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on November 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;In the countless hours I spend rocking my son to sleep, pushing his stroller, marveling at his sweaty little hands grasping a crayon, I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,&#8221; Jay wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jay says she has remained focused on her life as a mom to her young son, adding that &#8220;motherhood, I have learned, fills your time but not your mind&#8221; and stating:</p>



<p>&#8220;Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Broadway actor&#8217;s divorce from Jay was finalized in September, a dozen years after they began dating and nearly six years after their November 2018 wedding. </p>



<p>Also&#8230; six days after we first saw stories about Slater getting together with Grande.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the essay, Jay admitted the following: </p>



<p>&#8220;No one gets married thinking they’ll get divorced, in the same way we don’t board a plane expecting to crash. But I really never thought I would get divorced&#8230;.</p>



<p>&#8220;In this season of shock and mourning, over a year after the end of my marriage was made public, I deeply miss the life of invisibility I created for myself as a psychologist specializing in women’s mental health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jay tries to seek solace away from the spotlight, she says; a spotlight she never asked for and certainly does not desire.</p>



<p>&#8220;As for me, days with my son are sunny,&#8221; Jay wrote. &#8220;Days when I can&#8217;t escape the promotion of a movie associated with the saddest days of my life are darker.&#8221;</p>



<p>The award season campaign for <em>Wicked</em>, of course, has been as prominent as any movie in recent memory.</p>



<p>An especially private person, Jay went on:</p>



<p>&#8220;If I can’t be invisible anymore, I may as well introduce myself. You know how a sponge is most effective at absorbing liquid when it’s already a bit wet? Maybe we can think about my messy not-so-personal life in that way: a dose of my own loss, rage, powerlessness, sadness that helps me hold yours.</p>



<p>&#8220;So consider this essay my message in a bottle sent out to sea to maybe wash up at my patients’ feet someday: I’m sorry I can’t be invisible anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Careful not to hurl her ex too far under the bus, Jay also wrote of co-parenting and of Slater: </p>



<p>&#8220;While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not. Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Ariana Grande&#8217;s <em>Wicked </em>boyfriend breaks his silence on their relationship controversy, is that going to quell the backlash?</p>



<p>2023 was a busy relationship year for Ariana Grande. That year, she and Dalton Gomez &#8212; who is now her ex-husband &#8212; split.</p>



<p>Perhaps by some remarkable coincidence, that is also the year when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/lilly-jay-and-ethan-slater-divorcing-amidst-ariana-grande-relationship-our-family-was-just-collateral-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethan Slater split</a> with his wife, Lilly Jay, with whom he shares a young son.</p>



<p>Soon came the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ariana-grande-dalton-gomez-who-im-already-dating-ethan-slater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater were dating</a>. Now, Ariana&#8217;s <em>Wicked </em>costar (and boyfriend) is breaking his silence on the backlash that their relationship has received.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-grande-s-wicked-boyfriend-ethan-slater-breaks-his-silence">Ariana Grande&#8217;s &#8216;Wicked&#8217; boyfriend Ethan Slater breaks his silence</h2>



<p>There was a time when he was best known, if one can call it that, for playing Spongebob Squarepants on Broadway. Then, he landed the role of Boq in the 2024 <em>Wicked </em>film.</p>



<p>None of those are his biggest claim to fame. Becoming Ariana Grande&#8217;s boyfriend, and the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/ariana-grande-met-and-held-ethan-slaters-baby-just-months-before-relationship-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubious circumstances</a> surrounding their relationship, turned Ariana&#8217;s <em>Wicked </em>boyfriend into something close to a household name.</p>



<p>Nearly a year and a half after he went from (relative) obscurity to controversial headlines, how is he handling it all?</p>

<p>As a teenager, Ethan Slater met Lilly Jay. The two dated in college, married (for five years), and then welcomed their son in August of 2022. </p>



<p>In July of 2023, Ethan Slater filed to divorce Lilly. This filing came days <em>after </em>news broke that Ethan Slater was dating Ariana Grande. The two were <em>Wicked </em>castmates, and the timing of everything raised eyebrows and suspicions.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, October 30, <em>GQ </em>published an <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/ethan-slater-wicked-gq-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Ethan Slater</a>. &#8220;Obviously, it was a really super big year,” he understated about 2023. &#8220;And I think there was something that was really difficult about things in your private life being commented on and looked at by the public.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on October 19, 2024." class="wp-image-512232" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_arianagrande_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures 4th Annual Gala in Partnership with Rolex at Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on October 19, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-becoming-famous-as-ariana-grande-s-wicked-boyfriend-was-a-shock">Becoming famous as Ariana Grande&#8217;s &#8216;Wicked&#8217; boyfriend was a shock</h2>



<p>“There were a lot of big changes in private lives that were really happening,&#8221; Ethan Slater acknowledged vaguely.</p>



<p>&#8220;So it’s really hard to see people who don’t know anything about what’s happening commenting on it and speculating,&#8221; Ariana&#8217;s boyfriend complained.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; Slater accused, &#8220;getting things wrong about the people you love. So just to address that part of it, that feels really hard.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="776" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-776x1024.jpg" alt="Ethan Slater on June 2, 2019." class="wp-image-512234" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-776x1024.jpg 776w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-227x300.jpg 227w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-768x1014.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-1551x2048.jpg 1551w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-727x960.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-818x1080.jpg 818w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-909x1200.jpg 909w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_ethanslater_03-scaled.jpg 1939w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ethan Slater attends 2019 Drama Desk Awards at Steinway Hall on June 02, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: John Lamparski/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Ariana Grande has more experience <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/ariana-grande-yes-and-ethan-slater-romance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebuking critics</a> and even her own fans over her relationships. </p>



<p>“She’s such an amazing performer,&#8221; Ethan Slater gushed during the interview with <em>GQ</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I think everyone knows how good she is [as] a recording artist and all that,&#8221; he emphasized. That&#8217;s true. &#8220;But I’m just really blown away by the songwriting.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-this-change-how-people-feel-about-ethan-slater">Will this change how people feel about Ethan Slater?</h2>



<p>Well, no. Across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArianaGrandeSnark/comments/1gfm7ft/ethan_speaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>, people are panning Ethan Slater&#8217;s <em>GQ </em>interview. He&#8217;s not getting their sympathy &#8212; because, at the core of it, people are thinking of his ex-wife and their 2-year-old.</p>



<p>Some are absolutely putting Ariana Grande on blast. That might be fair, as she apparently did hang out with Lilly prior to Ethan&#8217;s breakup with her.</p>



<p>But if there was any cheating before the <em>Wicked </em>co-stars went public, the actual cheater is the wrongdoer. No one can &#8220;steal&#8221; someone else&#8217;s husband. Or, if they do, it&#8217;s called &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; and is generally considered to be a crime.</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/"><em>Wicked</em> has received a ton of Oscar nominations</a> (including a Best Supporting Actress nod for Ariana), this mini-scandal might be swept under the rug. But you can bet that Lilly won&#8217;t forget!</p>

<p>The nominations for the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/who-will-host-the-oscars-2025/">2025 Academy Awards</a> were announced this morning.</p>



<p>And as usual, film fans are upset over a handful of shocking snubs.</p>



<p>For starters, Angelina Jolie did <em>not</em> receive a nomination for her role in <em>Maria</em>, a performance that many considered the finest of her career.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2169311741-1024x683.jpg" alt='Angelina Jolie attends a red carpet for "Maria" during the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 29, 2024 in Venice, Italy.

<p>And she wasn&#8217;t the only A-lister to receive a disappointing call from her agent today.</p>



<p>Denzel Washington was shut out for his work in <em>Gladiator II</em>, and Daniel Craig was snubbed for his revelatory performance in <em>Queer</em>.</p>



<p>But while some of Hollywood&#8217;s most revered talents might not be taking home any hardware this year, a slew of major talents are celebrating their first nominations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/demi-moore/page/2/">Demi Moore</a>, Kieran Culkin, Mikey Madison, Fernanda Torres, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/tom-cruise-new-girlfriend/">Monica Barbaro</a>, Zoe Saldaña, and Ariana Grande have all been recognized by the Academy for the very first time.</p>

<p>Alongside co-star Cynthia Erivo (who received her second nod today), Ariana was nominated for her bravura work in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wicked-movie-reviews-does-broadway-adaption-hit-the-right-notes/">Wicked</a></em>.</p>



<p>The film tied <em>The Brutalist</em> for this year&#8217;s second-most nominations with 10 each. The controversial cartel musical comedy <em>Emilia Perez l</em>ed the pack with 13 noms.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the rest of the major nominees. The Oscars will air on March 2, with Conan O&#8217;Brien hosting for the first time. </p>

<p>Ariana Grande vs Carrie Underwood wasn&#8217;t on our 2025 bingo card, but we&#8217;ll take it!</p>



<p>Infamously, the country singer agreed to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-trump-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sing at Trump&#8217;s inauguration</a>.</p>



<p>While it wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the worst thing</a> to happen on Monday, it also didn&#8217;t go as planned. Underwood ended up singing a capella.</p>



<p>And it appears that one of the greatest voices on the planet is shading her over doing a less-than-impressive job.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-carrie-underwood-sang-america-the-beautiful-she-sang-a-capella">When Carrie Underwood sang &#8216;America The Beautiful,&#8217; she sang a capella</h2>



<p>In a moment that seemed like heavy-handed symbolism for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jimmy-kimmel-cries-2024-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump retaking power</a>, the music for <em>America The Beautiful</em> did not play. </p>



<p>Carrie Underwood sang the song using only her own voice (and a microphone), improvising the a capella performance when it was clear that the equipment would not be a quick fix.</p>



<p>Numerous political figures attended the inauguration, including (now former) Vice President Kamala Harris. And some on social media believed (or merely projected their own opinions) that she did not find Underwood&#8217;s rendition to be impressive.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="647" height="243" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_ig_01.png" alt="A dark mode Instagram screenshot." class="wp-image-517361" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_ig_01.png 647w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_ig_01-300x113.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">One snarky Instagram user captioned that the outgoing VP was not digging the 2025 Inaugural song.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Kamala Harris evoking Coco Montrese (“Girl, find the note”) watching Carrie Underwood at today’s chilling Inauguration,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFDo-lkufQG/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> user @evanrosskatz captioned a post.</p>



<p>Coco Montrese is an extremely well-known drag performer, and the quote about the note is from <em>RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race All Stars</em> Season 2. The catty post is roasting Carrie Underwood&#8217;s singing.</p>



<p>Social media users quickly noticed that Ariana Grande had given the post a &#8220;like.&#8221; (We here at <em>THG </em>would like to note that Ariana has since rescinded the &#8220;like&#8221; after it gained attention, though her brother&#8217;s like remains up)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-ariana-grande-indirectly-insulting-carrie-underwood">Was Ariana Grande indirectly insulting Carrie Underwood?</h2>



<p>The post itself was not shade, but a direct <em>read</em> &#8212; that is to say, an insult aimed at Carrie Underwood.</p>



<p>However, <em>liking </em>a post falls into a gray area (sometimes). It is even possible to accidentally double-tap an Instagram photo. Additionally, some people use social media likes as a bookmark function &#8212; to come back to later.</p>



<p>Most of the time, obviously, a &#8220;like&#8221; is close enough to an endorsement that celebrities know that their likes can become a scandal. Is that what happened here?</p>

<p>Comment after comment on a post that did not mention Ariana at all read things like &#8220;Ariana liked this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many of these included laughter or praise for Grande. Others simply peppered Carrie Underwood with insults.</p>



<p>However, other commenters pulled the &#8220;regardless of politics&#8221; card to compliment Underwood&#8217;s a capella rendition of <em>America The Beautiful</em>. </p>



<p>Some praised her voice, while others acknowledged that she made a good effort under less than ideal circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-she-actually-do-a-terrible-job">Did she actually do a terrible job?</h2>



<p>Music is subjective. So are singers. There are people who think that <em>Ariana Grande</em> doesn&#8217;t have an amazing singing voice. (They&#8217;re wrong, of course, but that&#8217;s beside the point)</p>



<p>The actual point is that this isn&#8217;t really about whether or not Carrie Underwood did a &#8220;good job&#8221; or even what Ariana Grande thinks of her singing. It probably has more to do with people expressing disgust for her and other artists who agreed to play for Trump&#8217;s inauguration.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s unfair criticism of Underwood&#8217;s performance. Not to mention that <em>morality </em>arguably matters much more than vocal range or remaining on-key. But we can acknowledge that this conversation was never just about a country singer&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>Is Ariana Grande pregnant?</p>



<p>In recent months, some people have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ariana-grande-body-shaming/">body-shamed Ariana</a> over her ultra-slender appearance.</p>



<p>Now, some of the denizens of TikTok are reporting something very different about her body.</p>



<p>Is this just a rumor? Wishful thinking? A new angle of body-shaming? Or is Ariana Grande now Ariana <em>Pregante</em>?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on January 5, 2025." class="wp-image-516393" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 05, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-ariana-grande-pregnant">Is Ariana Grande pregnant?</h2>



<p>&#8220;Ariana Grande is reportedly three months pregnant,&#8221; a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@newsdecodefy/video/7457649116881882390">TikTok</a> video reports. And it is not alone.</p>



<p>The post went on to claim that she &#8220;discovered she was expecting in October, the same day as her first <em>Wicked </em>press interview.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is incredibly specific! Presumably, the father would be Ethan Slater, Ariana&#8217;s <em>Wicked </em>castmate.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Multiple comments below the video show that even the TikTok audience isn&#8217;t immediately convinced. And that&#8217;s saying a <em>lot</em>, folks. TikTok is a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-agency/">notorious vector of disinformation</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, a series of TikTok denizens asked the same question: &#8220;Does Ariana know?&#8221;</p>



<p>The implication, of course, is that this is a baseless claim and that Ariana is not, to her knowledge, pregnant. It&#8217;s worth investigating where the rumor originates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-there-a-source-for-saying-that-ariana-grande-is-pregnant">Is there a source for saying that Ariana Grande is pregnant?</h2>



<p>Ariana Grande has not made any pregnancy announcement. Her silly little guy, the <em>Spongebob </em>musical star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/ariana-grande-ethan-slater-marriage-children/">Ethan Slater</a>, hasn&#8217;t either. </p>



<p>Sometimes, pregnancy news leaks from close family or friends or even professionals. Many celebrities know that contacting first responders or visiting a hospital is barely different from calling certain tabloids directly.</p>



<p>But this doesn&#8217;t come from <em>TMZ </em>or <em>People </em>or <em>Page Six</em>. This isn&#8217;t even a dubious <em>Deuxmoi </em>claim. And it doesn&#8217;t seem to match up with any blind items, to our knowledge.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="741" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-1024x741.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on January 7, 2025." class="wp-image-516395" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-300x217.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-768x556.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-2048x1482.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-960x695.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-1080x782.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_03-1200x868.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends The National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala  at Cipriani 42nd Street on January 07, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for National Board of Review)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thus far, we&#8217;re just seeing unsubstantiated claims on TikTok. Which is a <em>lovely </em>place for people to do duets with strangers or to share recipes for food. Not so much for, like, actual information about the world.</p>



<p>On the positive side for Ariana, this rumor doesn&#8217;t appear to be body-shaming. She is extremely slender.</p>



<p>In fact, this may be a form of wishful thinking from some of her fans. Maybe they&#8217;d like to see her have a kid, even if it&#8217;s with Ethan, who pretty famously already had a kid shortly before <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/ethan-slaters-ex-wife-delves-into-public-downfall-of-marriage-as-ex-dates-ariana-grande/">the downfall of his marriage</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="762" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-1024x762.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande hugs Ethan Slater, her silly little guy, on November 14, 2024." class="wp-image-516396" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-300x223.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-768x571.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-2048x1523.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-960x714.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-1080x803.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0109_arianagrande_04-1200x893.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater attend the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; New York Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on November 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-right-now-having-a-baby-probably-isn-t-her-focus">Right now, having a baby probably isn&#8217;t her focus</h2>



<p>Ariana Grande just dazzled audiences with <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wicked-elphaba-glinda-gay/">Wicked</a></em>, even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ariana-grande-botox-palm-springs-jennifer-coolidge/">taking home a &#8220;Rising Star&#8221; award</a> even though she has been a household name for a decade and has been acting since she was a child.</p>



<p>Presumably, if she&#8217;s serious about Ethan (which many of her fans would not understand, but that&#8217;s her business), she&#8217;ll want to spend more time considering their next step.</p>



<p>Not only did Ethan exit a marriage relatively recently, but so did she. Taking time to reassess your next step is always a good idea.</p>

<p>Ariana Grande thanked Botox while accepting an award. </p>



<p>Was she serious or joking? Maybe both.</p>



<p>Though she has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ariana-grande-body-shaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit back at body-shamers</a> before, Ariana offered a shout-out to two anti-aging treatments on stage.</p>



<p>However, she then went on to clarify that she is now &#8220;clean.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-682x1024.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on January 3, 2025 at the Palm Springs International Film Awards." class="wp-image-516125" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_01-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the 36th Annual Palm Springs International Film Awards at Palm Springs Convention Center on January 03, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Palm Springs International Film Society)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-rising-star-award-goes-to-ariana-grande">The Rising Star Award goes to &#8230; Ariana Grande?</h2>



<p>On Friday, January 3, Ariana Grande received the Rising Star award at the Palm Springs International Film Awards</p>



<p>It was a bit odd. Ariana has been acting since she was a child. She was a Nickelodeon star about 15 years ago, and was on Broadway before that. She has also been a household name for years and years.</p>



<p>“I never thought at the age of 31 I would be hearing the words ‘rising star’ again,&#8221; Ariana acknowledged while accepting her award. &#8220;So I wanted to start by thanking my two friends: Botox and Juvederm.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Later, Ariana took to the red carpet, where she spoke to <em>Entertainment Tonight</em> &#8212; as you can see below.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh my gosh, my joke,&#8221; she said excitedly, laughing as she referred to the on-stage tribute as &#8220;my bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be fair, she also pretended that her award weighed enough to overbalance her when receiving it from Jennifer Coolidge. Ariana is an extremely funny person, so this joke about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/ariana-grande-face-surgery-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her face</a> fits well with her brand.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande attends the Golden Globe Awards on January 5, 2025." class="wp-image-516126" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0107_arianagrande_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Singer-songwriter Ariana Grande arrives for the 82nd annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on January 5, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ariana-grande-clarifies-that-she-is-clean-when-it-comes-to-botox">Ariana Grande clarifies that she is &#8216;clean&#8217; when it comes to Botox</h2>



<p>“I’m still clean, I’m still clean,” Ariana clarified, using comedic phrasing. Clean generally refers to addictive substances such as alcohol or prescription painkillers.</p>



<p>“But when I start going again, I’ll let you know,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I mean it. I really want to be transparent as a beauty founder, as the founder of R.E.M. Beauty.&#8221; </p>



<p>After plugging the name of her beauty brand, Ariana expressed: &#8220;I think it’s important to have transparency.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Ariana Grande mentions this in her Hilarious speech for Rising Star" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpD7JBIRhME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“I love it, I support it,” Ariana Grande then emphasized of things like Botox and fillers. “But I am still four years clean.”</p>



<p>Previously, she has described herself as having gone &#8220;cold turkey&#8221; in 2018 on things like lip filler and other injectible cosmetic treatments. That&#8217;s a little beyond her four-year timeline.</p>



<p>Either way, she&#8217;s making it clear that she supports people who use these treatments. It&#8217;s just that Ariana herself no longer does.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-rising-star-really-the-right-award">Is &#8216;Rising Star&#8217; really the right award?</h2>



<p>Though Ariana Grande had a stellar performance as Glinda in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wicked-elphaba-glinda-gay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wicked</a> </em>(she made me <em>sob </em>at one point), her fame is not new. Award presenter (and Ariana&#8217;s friend) Jennifer Coolidge remarked on just that.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t want to argue with the Palm Springs power gays or their little 19-year-old handsome dates,&#8221; Jennifer Coolidge admitted, &#8220;but I just thought rising star? Hasn’t Ariana Grande already risen?&#8221;</p>



<p>She pointed out: &#8220;I mean, the girl’s barely 30 and it feels like she’s been famous since the Eisenhower administration.&#8221;</p>



<p>Every part of that quote has been rattling around in our brains every since.</p>

<p>Ariana Grande wants to make something clear: no one has the right to &#8216;say s&#8211;t&#8217; about her body.</p>



<p>With the box office success of <em>Wicked Part 1</em>, fans are holding space for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wicked-elphaba-glinda-gay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana and Cynthia&#8217;s interviews</a>.</p>



<p>The two have addressed everything from shipping discourse to the emotional impact of the soundtrack.</p>



<p>And in a new interview, Ariana is also clapping back at body-shaming that she has received.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-body-shamers-have-been-going-after-ariana-grande-for-a-long-time">Body-shamers have been going after Ariana Grande for a long time</h2>



<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeHehrbvkA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with French content creator Crazy Sally, Ariana Grande and Cynthia touched upon <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/ariana-grande-wicked-boyfriend-ethan-slater-breaks-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topics beyond <em>Wicked</em></a>. One of those topics was body-shaming.</p>



<p>“I’ve been doing this in front of the public and been a specimen in a Petri dish really since I was 16 or 17. I have heard it all. I’ve heard every version of it,” 31-year-old Ariana acknowledged.</p>



<p>The singer, who was on Broadway before she ever graced a Nickelodeon set, added: “You’re young and you’re hearing all kinds of things.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on November 14, 2024." class="wp-image-514679" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_arianagrande_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; New York Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on November 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">“It’s hard to protect yourself from that noise,&#8221; Ariana acknowledged. &#8220;It’s something that is uncomfortable no matter what scale you’re experiencing it on.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">She added: &#8220;Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone&#8217;s granny says &#8216;Oh my god you look skinnier, what happened?&#8217; or &#8216;You look heavier what happened?'&#8221;</p>



<p>As if invoking the nonsense-words from <em>Wicked</em>&#8216;s lyrics, Ariana addressed the &#8220;comfortability&#8221; that society gives people when it comes to commenting on other people&#8217;s bodies.</p>

<p>Ariana characterized this sort of toxic cultural intrusion as &#8220;dangerous for all parties involved.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0">How does she cope with it? “I’m really lucky to have the support system that I have and to just know and trust that I’m beautiful,&#8221; the beloved singer explained. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0">&#8220;But I do know what the pressure of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/ariana-grande-face-surgery-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that noise</a> feels like,&#8221; Ariana acknowledged. &#8220;It’s been a resident in my life since I was 17.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-like-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-has-seen-this-ugly-side-of-society">Like Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo has seen this ugly side of society</h2>



<p>Cynthia noted that she brought her experience as an &#8220;alternative and different&#8221; Black woman to her role in <em>Wicked</em>. </p>



<p>She also emphasized that she feels &#8220;proud&#8221; of Ariana for discussing this with such honesty. It&#8217;s not an easy topic.</p>



<p>Many might try to argue that they are merely expressing &#8220;concerns.&#8221; That&#8217;s true of Ariana&#8217;s fans or of someone&#8217;s grandma. However, <em>actual </em>care for someone means not trying to police their body. Yes, even celebrities. Even the skinny ones.</p>

<p>Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater may have marriage in their future.</p>



<p>Only with the release of <em>Wicked </em>do we really hear <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/ariana-grande-wicked-boyfriend-ethan-slater-breaks-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethan Slater address the scandal</a> of how this romance began. And, of course, of how his marriage ended.</p>



<p>But with <em>Wicked</em>&#8216;s release, and the success of Part 1, comes the question of what&#8217;s next for these two.</p>



<p>A new report reveals that Ariana is discussing the idea of marrying and having kids with her controversial man.</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/ariana-grande-is-talking-about-kids-with-ethan-slater-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> by <em>Life &amp; Style</em>, &#8220;Ariana is madly in love and very eager to marry Ethan.&#8221;</p>



<p>The inside source emphasizes that: &#8220;It&#8217;s just a matter of timing it right.&#8221; That&#8217;s true with most weddings, but especially given the logistics of his recent divorce.</p>



<p>&#8220;His divorce was finalized [in September], so he’s free to marry her,&#8221; the insider emphasized. &#8220;And they’ve both been talking quite openly about how they plan to spend forever together.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on November 18, 2024." class="wp-image-514443" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-801x1200.jpg 801w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_02-scaled.jpg 1708w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the &#8220;Wicked: Part One&#8221; European Premiere at The Royal Festival Hall on November 18, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Tim P.

<p>With the various holidays coming up, this could be a potentially perfect time. Particular, the report shares, when it comes to a Christmas proposal.</p>



<p>According to the source, Ariana &#8220;has been dropping loud hints&#8221; that she would like an engagement ring as a gift.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the insider alleges that she is also thinking of another major life milestone.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="759" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-1024x759.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater on November 14, 2024." class="wp-image-514444" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-1024x759.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-300x222.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-768x569.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-2048x1518.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-960x712.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-1080x801.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_03-1200x889.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater attend the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; New York Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on November 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-ariana-grande-want-to-have-ethan-slater-s-babies">Does Ariana Grande want to have Ethan Slater&#8217;s babies?</h2>



<p>“She’s talking about their future kids a lot,” the inside course then claimed.</p>



<p>“So that’s something that will likely happen before long as well,&#8221; the insider predicted.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Ethan] does have a child already,&#8221; the source pointed out, skipping over some salient details. &#8220;So, she’s had the chance to try out the stepmom role and she says she loves it.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande on November 14, 2024." class="wp-image-514445" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_04-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande attends the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; New York Premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on November 14, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, the report stresses that Ariana Grande will want a marriage to Ethan Slater before they start producing remarkably short children.</p>



<p>“She’s traditional,&#8221; the insider characterized. &#8220;So unless something throws a wrench in things, everyone is expecting her to marry him next year so they can get to work on having kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s quite a timeline. Especially since Ariana and Ethan only met in late 2022. And Ethan&#8217;s divorce was only finalized a couple of months ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="658" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-1024x658.jpg" alt="Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater on June 8, 2024." class="wp-image-514446" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-300x193.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-768x494.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-2048x1316.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-960x617.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-1080x694.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1204_arianagrande_05-1200x771.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater react prior to Game One of the 2024 Stanley Cup Final between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers at Amerant Bank Arena on June 08, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-speaking-of-the-timeline-of-it-all">Speaking of the timeline of it all &#8230;</h2>



<p>Simply put, the timeline of Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater&#8217;s love story has raised eyebrows. And, perhaps, red flags.</p>



<p>Ariana reportedly met Ethan&#8217;s then-wife, Lilly Jay, and the couple&#8217;s infant child before the marriage ended and she and Ethan got together. Some have read a lot into that and declared that there was cheating, or even called Ariana a &#8220;home-wrecker.&#8221;</p>



<p>We should not assume too much. And, more importantly, even if these assumptions are accurate, Ariana would at worst be guilty of being a poor friend to Lilly Jay. Unless kidnapping is involved, it is impossible to &#8220;steal&#8221; a man. Ethan Slater is a grown man, no matter his height, and capable of making his own choices.</p>

<p>Are Elphaba and Glinda gay?</p>



<p>Since <em>Wicked </em>first debuted on Broadway (and, arguably, many decades before that), fans have been shipping the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch of the North.</p>



<p>Their tense opposites-attract dynamic is all there. The song &#8220;What Is This Feeling?&#8221; begins almost as if describing a mutual schoolgirl crush.</p>



<p>Ariana Grande <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/cynthia-erivo-wicked-poster-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Cynthia Erivo</a> are weighing in on their characters&#8217; sexualities. And so is the OG <em>Wicked</em> Glinda, Kristin Chenoweth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-have-theorized-that-glinda-is-gay-for-many-years">Fans have theorized that Glinda is gay for many years</h2>



<p><em>Wicked </em>is out in theaters. Even among Broadway musicals, <em>Wicked </em>has a particularly strong following within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>



<p>So it is only natural that Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba in the theatrical adaptation, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/ariana-grande-wicked-boyfriend-ethan-slater-breaks-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Ariana Grande</a>, who plays Glinda, would chat with <em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gaytimes/video/7439810119589776673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gay Times</a></em> on the topic.</p>



<p>As you can se in the video below, neither shied away from suggestions that their characters&#8217; friendships &#8212; and animosity &#8212; had an undercurrent of romantic love.</p>

<p>“I think Elphie, she goes wherever the wind blows,” Cynthia described of her verdant character. </p>



<p>She added: “I think she loves Glinda. I think she loves love.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cynthia then emphasized: &#8220;And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with celebrating the deep connection that both of them have.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-is-true-love">&#8216;It is true love&#8217;</h2>



<p>“They do have a real relationship,&#8221; Cynthia went on to emphasize about the <em>Wicked </em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/what-does-otp-mean-one-true-pairing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OTP</a>, Glinda and Elphaba.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is true love, which is probably why people are shipping it, you know?&#8221; she suggested. </p>



<p>Cynthia then affirmed: &#8220;Because what they build with each other is an unbreakable bond and love.”</p>

<p>“And trust and truth,&#8221; Ariana Grande chimed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just such a safe space for one another, which is what all relationships should be,&#8221; she expressed. &#8220;Whether it’s romantic or platonic.&#8221;</p>



<p>Delving into her character&#8217;s sexuality, Ariana commented: &#8220;Glinda might be a little in the closet. You never know! Give it a little more time.”</p>

<p>Kristin Chenoweth, who portrayed Glinda in its original Broadway run, replied to <em>E! News</em>&#8216; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCqC2tNRfl_/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post that shared part of the aforementioned discussion.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought so too way back when &#8230;&#8221; the Broadway legend commented.</p>



<p>Truth be told, Elphaba and Glinda have a story that makes more sense if you see the gay undertones of mutual yearning &#8212; and frustration. </p>

<p>Obviously, not everyone will agree that Glinda is gay.</p>



<p>First of all, some folks do not want to see clear relationships. There are people who watch <em>X-Men </em>movies and don&#8217;t see them as Professor X and Magneto making their divorce everyone&#8217;s problem. There are people who think that Xena and Gabrielle were just very good friends.</p>



<p>Also, to be fair, there are many excellent adaptations of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. The Glinda in NBC&#8217;s short-lived but excellent<em> Emerald City</em> is not the same as the <em>Wicked </em>version who is not the same as the Glinda who debuted in Technicolor nearly a century ago.</p>



<p>Just another prime example of love is love. </p>
