<p>London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police have charged comedian Russell Brand with rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault.</p>



<p>The charges come on the heels of an investigation that began in 2023, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/russell-brand-accused-of-raping-sexually-assaulting-numerous-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five women accused Brand</a> of varying acts of sexual misconduct.</p>



<p>Brand is scheduled to appear in London&#8217;s Westminster Magistrates&#8217; Court on May 2.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-charges-against-brand-follow-18-month-investigation">Charges against Brand follow 18-month investigation</h2>



<p>News of the charges comes courtesy of a statement from Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy.</p>



<p>“The women who have made reports continue to receive support from specially trained officers,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/russell-brand-charged-rape-sexual-assault-police-7971304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Furphy said</a> in a statement issued on Friday.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Met&#8217;s investigation remains open and detectives ask anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information, to come forward and speak with police.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brand has now been charged with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape, and two counts of sexual assault.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-laundry-list-of-appalling-allegations">A laundry list of appalling allegations</h2>



<p>Police interest in Brand&#8217;s alleged crimes began with a joint investigation by <em>The Sunday Times</em>, <em>The Times</em>, and Channel 4 current affairs show <em>Dispatches</em>, the results of which were made public in September 2023.</p>



<p>One alleged victim said Brand assaulted her when she was 16 (he was then in his 30s) during a three-month “emotionally and sexually abusive” relationship that included one instance where he “forced his penis down her throat,” causing her to choke.</p>



<p>In another example, she claims he removed a condom during intercourse without her knowledge.</p>



<p>The woman also said Brand nicknamed her “the child,” asked her to read passages from Vladimir Nabokov&#8217;s novel Lolita during their time together, and once kissed her mother “on the mouth.”</p>



<p>A second alleged victim told the publication she was raped by the comedian in his Los Angeles home in 2012 &#8212; while a third, who was working with him in Los Angeles, said he sexually assaulted her at his West Hollywood home in 2013 and threatened to take legal action if she ever spoke about the incident in public.</p>

<p>Others who spoke to the newspaper accused Brand of flashing his private parts and showing them intimate photos of other women. One female comedian said Brand would repeatedly “bite” her face any time she saw him.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/russell-brand-accuser-wrote-letter-after-alleged-rape-do-you-know-what-you-put-me-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brand responded</a> with a YouTube video in which he smugly denied the allegations.</p>



<p>“I’ve received two extremely disturbing letters, or a letter and an email, one from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks,” he said. </p>



<p>“But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.”</p>



<p>Brand has yet to publicly respond to the news that he&#8217;s been formally charged. We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Katy Perry knows a thing or two about divorce. It&#8217;s painful, heartbreaking, and extra no fun when the world watches on as you navigate the reality of decoupling. </p>



<p>So, how do things stand with Orlando Bloom these days? The pair seem happy, yet there are murmurs that things could be heading to a breaking point.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-katy-perry-divorced-first-husband-before-orlando">Katy Perry Divorced First Husband Before Orlando</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Katy wasn&#8217;t married to a pirate, but to a comedian. </p>



<p>After a brief courtship, Russell Brand proposed to Katy on New Year’s Eve during a trip to Jaipur, India. A few months later, on October 23, 2010, they returned to the country to wed. </p>



<p>From the outside, it looks like they were perfectly matched. However, the marriage wasn&#8217;t meant to last The divorce of <a href="/2011/12/katy-perry-and-russell-brand-its-over/">Katy Perry and Russell Brand</a> was reportedly months in the making, despite only lasting 14 months to begin with. </p>



<p>Reports from the time claimed Katy and Russell knew the relationship was on the rocks soon after getting hitched. However, they didn&#8217;t want to bail on the marriage without a concerted effort to work it out.</p>



<p>Then the love ran out, and more than that, the world actually watched the official moment of their marriage ending on-screen. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="835" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674-1024x835.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-498697" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674-1024x835.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674-300x245.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674-768x627.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674-960x783.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674-1080x881.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2011/12/GettyImages-122720674.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Golden couple Katy Perry and Russell Brand arrive at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-katy-perry-s-divorce-started-with-a-text">Katy Perry&#8217;s Divorce Started With A Text</h2>



<p>“He’s a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him. Let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me,&#8221; Katy confessed to <em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-xpm-2013-jun-18-la-et-mg-katy-perry-vogue-russell-brand-divorce-text-message-john-mayer-20130618-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a> </em>in 2013. </p>



<p>That was two years after the divorce was finalized. Fans have long believed that this moment was actually documented in Katy&#8217;s concert documentary <em>Part of Me</em>. </p>



<p>One unforgettable scene from the film showed the Katy breaking down in tears after a text from her then husband, before picking herself up, dusting herself off, and going on stage to perform to a packed venue.</p>



<p>Despite the text and the fact that Russell was the one to file for the divorce, in that same interview, Katy admitted she initially felt responsible for the marriage not working out.</p>



<p>“I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go and I was like: This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that.”</p>



<p>And move on she did!</p>

<p>For years, Katy had high-profile relationships with the hottest music acts of the day: John Mayer, Diplo, even Robert Pattinson. (Yes, Edward sings!)</p>



<p>But when she finally met <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-relationship-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orlando Bloom</a> in January 2016, a new chapter of her life began. Orlando, who is also divorced, fell for her quickly. After a brief breakup in 2017, the two have been together ever since, even welcoming a daughter together.</p>



<p>While the pair are engaged, they have yet to get married. However, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-wedding-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wedding plans</a> are in the works, so the insiders say, and 2024 is looking good to be the year these two get hitched. </p>



<p>Ergo, without being married, they can&#8217;t technically get divorced. So, nothing to really worry about there.</p>



<p>But with Katy leaving <em>American Idol</em> and plans for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/katy-perry-pregnant-baby-number-2-american-idol-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baby #2</a> in the works, the time does feel like now for these two. Finally!</p>

<p>Earlier this week, five women came forward to<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/russell-brand-accused-of-raping-sexually-assaulting-numerous-women/"> accuse comedian Russell Brand of sexual assault</a>.</p>



<p>Throughout his career, Brand has frequently boasted about his sexual escapades, but the accounts offered in his books and standup comedy routines did nothing to prepare fans for the allegations reported on Sunday via a joint investigation by <em>The Times </em>and U.K. current affairs show Channel 4 <em>Dispatches</em>.</p>



<p>The claims against Brand range from harassment to rape.</p>



<p>The youngest of the victims alleges that she was just 16 when she was pressured into having sex with Brand, who was 32 at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/russell-brand-accuser-wrote-letter-after-alleged-rape-do-you-know-what-you-put-me-through/">Another woman alleged that Brand raped her</a> against the wall of his home in 2012.</p>



<p>In a video posted to his social media accounts, Brand fervently denied the allegations and insisted that he&#8217;s the victim of a vast media conspiracy.</p>



<p>The situation has prompted a reexamination of some of Brand&#8217;s public behavior over the years.</p>



<p>The 48-year-old has spent decades in the spotlight, and his tendency to make light of his sexual appetites often resulted in material that was distressing at the time and downright disturbing in retrospect.</p>

<p></p>



<p>For example, many critics have pointed to a 2013 <em>Tonight Show</em> appearance in which Brand pulled a shocked Katherine McPhee into his lap as host Jimmy Fallon attempted to intervene.</p>



<p>“I’ll just be here, with my sexual charisma,” Brand quipped once he and McPhee were finally separated.</p>



<p>McPhee recently downplayed the incident, saying,  “This specific incident was over 10 years ago, and it was harmless.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Of course, that&#8217;s the only incident in which Brand seemed comfortable making insinuations about a female colleague for laughs.</p>



<p>In 2018, Brand appeared on an episode of the &#8220;Loose Women&#8221; podcast that aired just days before the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/meghan-markle-still-angry-at-katy-perry-over-wedding-dress-jokes/">wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</a>.</p>



<p>“Is it true that you’ve snogged Meghan Markle?” one of the show&#8217;s hosts asked during the interview.</p>



<p>“As a matter of fact it is,” said Brand, pausing as the the audience cheered wildly. </p>

<p></p>



<p>“But let me say before we get carried away. She was in a film that I was in, <em>Get Him to the Greek</em>. It was a good film.”</p>



<p>Brand went on to explain that he scarcely recalls Markle&#8217;s presence on set, as she was an unknown actress who “wasn’t married to a royal person.”</p>



<p>“I don’t remember the film that much, I think I planted one on her in the scene,” continued Brand, noting that that the scene in question was “scripted&#8221; and not improvised.</p>



<p>“I only know this because I think I saw a clip of it somewhere. Meghan Markle, there we go,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In fairness to Brand, he promptly clarified the matter, but the question was likely only asked because of the murmurs of his on-set behavior toward female co-stars that have followed him throughout his career.</p>



<p>Brand&#8217;s <em>Get Him to the Greek </em>character, Aldous Snow, originated in the 2008 rom-com <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>.</p>



<p>The female lead in that film, Kristen Bell, says she had no trouble with Brand on set, but she also recalls that she felt the need to issue a warning to the notoriously randy comic in response to his reputation.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“I made it really clear from the beginning that I would sock him in the balls if he tried ­anything,” she said to the <em>Daily Mail</em>, two years after the film&#8217;s release.</p>



<p> “So he was intimidated, truth be told.”</p>



<p>Over the course of his career, Brand has reveled in his reputation as an ardent ladies&#8217; man and a tireless seducer.</p>



<p>But as the investigation into his past continues, the comic might find himself regretting some of those boasts and jests.</p>

<p>Several months ago, a somewhat prophetic social media user mused that Russell Brand was pivoting to extreme right-wing positions so that he could claim that any &#8220;accusations&#8221; were an attempt to silence him.</p>



<p>While terrible men seldom need a motive to tilt towards reactionary, polarized positions &#8230; that tweet has aged better than Twitter itself.</p>



<p>Grimly, five women have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/russell-brand-accused-of-raping-sexually-assaulting-numerous-women/">publicly accused Russell Brand of rape, sexual abuse, and more</a>. One of the survivors was only 16 at the time.</p>



<p>One of his accusers actually wrote a letter to him following the alleged assault. And its contents, now public, are a heartbreaking read.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russell-brand-accuser-interview-rape-sexual-assault-allegations-investigation-p0tw7hxrn"><em>The Sunday Times</em> has published</a> a letter that Nadia, one of the courageous women who has come forward, wrote to Russell Brand in 2012.</p>



<p>Nadia (that is her sole public identification; we have all witnessed the treatment that women who accuse famous men of evil deeds receive) wrote that she felt &#8220;completely disgusted&#8221; by how he had treated her.</p>



<p>In the letter, she also expressed how &#8220;sad&#8221; she felt that she had trusted him in the first place.</p>

<p>“Very angry with you and myself for getting sucked into your narcissistic world,” she expressed.</p>



<p>“Do you know what you put me through? My body through?&#8221; Nadia demanded in the letter.</p>



<p>She characterized how &#8220;My emotions and body are turned upside down.&#8221;</p>

<p>“You scared the s&#8211;t out of me on July 1st,&#8221; Nadia accused. &#8220;I thought in any situation I would be strong enough to fight someone off.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her letter continued: &#8220;But when it’s someone you know, you don’t expect to be put in that position. You completely broke me down.”</p>



<p>Nadia asked: “Do you even know how scary you are when that glazed look comes over you?&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;I didn’t see the fun loving guy in front of me,&#8221; Nadia wrote. &#8220;I saw a man who couldn’t control himself and the word NO is more of a challenge than a command.”</p>



<p>Just for the record, many experts in abusers and predators argue that the idea of them <em>losing control</em> is a myth. For example, abusers are more likely to destroy a victim&#8217;s belongings. That&#8217;s not a lack of control; it&#8217;s an act of terror.</p>



<p>Even in the letter from all of those years ago, Nadia openly wondered why she protected him. She didn&#8217;t press charges. And she didn&#8217;t disclose his name at the rape treatment center.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="684" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-684x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-483764" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-768x1150.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-1026x1536.jpg 1026w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-735x1101.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-224x335.jpg 224w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-232x347.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-513x768.jpg 513w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-641x960.jpg 641w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-721x1080.jpg 721w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-459571184-scaled.jpg 1709w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Russell Brand poses for photographs as he arrives to deliver The Reading Agency Lecture at The Institute of Education on November 25, 2014 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“This letter is for me to work through my stuff, not for you, I just needed you to hear me,” Nadia explained in the letter.</p>



<p>It is a very common therapeutic technique for survivors to write letters expressing their anger at an abuser, a rapist, or someone who has otherwise harmed them.</p>



<p>Sometimes, they send the letters. Other times, they exist only for therapy. (In some cases, the assailant is unknown, or deceased)</p>

<p>While no one should ever have to explain this, Nadia did share why she didn&#8217;t publicly accuse Brand of rape at the time.</p>



<p>She did not want to be responsible for ruining his career. (Just a reminder &#8212; rapists ruin lives and, in the rare cases where they are exposed and face consequences, ruin their <em>own </em>careers)</p>



<p>Brand&#8217;s social media impact has been alarming lately. But Nadia noted: “He’s saying one thing and I know the demon underneath it.” Well phrased.</p>

<p>Russell Brand has been accused of rape, sexual assault and physical and emotional abuse by five women &#8230; via a joint investigation by The Sunday Times, The Times and U.K. current affairs show Channel 4 Dispatches. </p>



<p>The British newspaper spoke with four of these alleged victims &#8212; one of whom says she was 16 at the time of the incident &#8212; in an article published on Saturday afternoon.</p>



<p>Brand is reported to have committed these heinous acts between 2006 and 2013 when he served as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4, along with appearing in a number of high profile movies.</p>

<p>The outlet writes that one alleged victim said Brand assaulted her when she was 16 (he was then in his 30s) during a three-month “emotionally and sexually abusive” relationship that included one instance where he “forced his penis down her throat,” causing her to choke. </p>



<p>In another example, she claims he removed a condom during intercourse without her knowledge. </p>



<p>The woman also said Brand nicknamed her “the child,” asked her to read passages from Vladimir Nabokov novel “Lolita” during their time together and once kissed her mother “on the mouth.”</p>

<p>A second alleged victim told the publication she was raped by the comedian in his Los Angeles home in 2012 &#8212; while a third, who was working with him in Los Angeles, said he sexually assaulted her at his West Hollywood home in 2013 &#8230; threatening to take legal action if she ever spoke about the incident in public.</p>



<p>Others who spoke to the newspaper accused Brand of flashing his private parts to them; showing them intimate photos of other women; and one female comedian said Brand would repeatedly &#8220;bite&#8221; her face any time she saw him.</p>



<p>In a YouTube video titled “So, This Is Happening,” Brand has denied the allegations.</p>

<p>“These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>&#8220;And as I’ve written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous. </p>



<p>&#8220;Now during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual.”</p>



<p>Brand was also married to Katy Perry from 2010 through 2012.</p>

<p>Added the actor in his self-defensive video:</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve received two extremely disturbing letters, or a letter and an email, one from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks.</p>



<p>&#8220;But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brand cited &#8220;witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives&#8221; of at least some of these claims, concluding as follows:</p>



<p><em>We are obviously going to look into this matter because it&#8217;s very, very, serious. In the meantime, I want you to stay close, stay awake, but more important than any of that, if you can, please stay free.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It&rsquo;s been a while since Russell Brand sent a text message telling Katy Perry he wants a divorce. </span>And Katy has even moved onto new men.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">For instance, <a href="/2015/04/katy-perry-and-john-mayer-back-together-yet-again/">Katy Perry and John Mayer are back together</a>. Again. But despite the time and new beau, Katy might not be over Russell.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Well, she might not be over bashing him at least.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p class="p2">In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Katy said she hasn&rsquo;t spoken to Russell for two years.&nbsp; However, she might have <a href="http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2015/katy-perry-despises-russell-brand-since-text-message-divorce-plans-music-to-slam-ex-husband/">a few things to say to him</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">She said, &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t spoken to me since he texted me saying he was filing for divorce. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about him. My songs will say what I need to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">The couple married in 2010, then separated barely a year later. After <a href="/2011/12/katy-perry-and-russell-brand-its-over/">Russell Brand and Katy Perry split</a>, she&#8217;s been moving on as much as she can.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">When asked if she still has the cat they purchased together named Rusty &#8211; a combination of the names &#8211; she said yes.</p>
<p class="p2">But she has changed the cat&rsquo;s name to Monkey.</p>
<p class="p2">The highly-publicized divorce caused a lot of suffering for Katy.&nbsp; But she is moving up and moving on with her new relationship and her music.</p>
<p class="p2">When asked if she has given up on love, she responded, No, absolutely not. I&rsquo;m excited by whatever it brings. I&rsquo;m excited by my own evolution.&quot;</p>
<p class="p2">&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to end up bittersweet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&ldquo;I have to evolve, I have to continue to push people&rsquo;s perception of me. As an artist I like to do that, keep people at the edge of their seats,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p class="p2">We are glad that she is staying optimistic.&nbsp; But the fact that her music has some things to say to Russell makes us question if she is truly ready to move on.</p>
<p class="p2">Or maybe she is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always fun to bash your ex&hellip;especially when you have an international audience listening. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Either way, we can&rsquo;t wait to hear what she has to say about her douche of an ex-husband!</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="/2012/03/katy-perry-part-of-me-not-a-slap-at-russell-brand/">Katy&#8217;s song &quot;Part of Me&quot;</a> was thought to be about Brand; Perry claimed the song was written before they split.</p>

Russell Brand gave a male stranger a hand job in the bathroom of a London pub and didn&#8217;t like it all that much.</p>
<p>So the comedian shockingly claims, noting it was all for British documentary series he was working on at the time with the goal of exploring social taboos.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one way of putting it.</p>

<p>As part of his social experiment <em>Re: Brand</em>, Russell recounted the story in great detail a podcast interview with fellow British comedian Richard Herring.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2013/10/russell-brand-admits-giving-stranger-sex-handjob-pub-toilet/">I w**ked off a man in a toilet</a>,&#8221; he said, matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, ‘I think of myself as heterosexual but perhaps that’s ‘cause of the environment that I grew up in where homosexuality may have been difficult for me to express.’”</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Admitting that he was in the grips of heroin addiction at the time, Brand goes into graphic detail about the day he looked for a stranger to be part of the sexual experiment.</p>
<p>“I trawled around Soho…going [to] various gay bars, gay gyms trying to pick people up with a film crew. I went in this pub and I goes: ‘Anyone want me to wank them off?’</p>
<p>“And this bloke goes, ‘Yep’. Like as if I was saying: ‘Does anyone want a packet of crisps [potato chips] from the bar…?&#8217; So we goes to the lavvy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, him, the director, and… he gets his willy out. And it was not nice. The phallus is… I like mine and you see some others in paintings that look all right but his looked like a rag.”</p>
<p>Brand does not stop there. He recalls of his next step, “I took it betwixt my fingers thusly. It were [sic] like massaging a naked mole rat and it wouldn’t go hard!</p>
<p>“And we’re… in the toilet with the director standing there filming me and he goes, ‘I think…it would be easier if I was able to touch yours’.</p>
<p>“And I [thought] ‘F**king hell mate, do us a favor!’ And the director goes: ‘Go on Russell it would be funny…’ So I take down my trousers and pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the bloke sort of mauled at my genitals while I wanked him off.”</p>
<p>Brand was determined to do a good job, too, admitting, “I’m such a sex narcissist that, even though I’m not gay, I still wanted to be good at giving him a wank…”</p>
<p>The whole incident eventually came to a messy conclusion, Russell Brand says. Only “after about 27 and 11 minutes, he spat a string of grey j**m.”</p>
<p>“My hand feels all funny just remembering…He was a right weirdo.”</p>
<p>The handjob episode was one of just a series of social taboos the comedian admits he explored in a “very irresponsible, cavalier, slapdash fashion.”</p>
<p>The zany Brit also had a bath with a homeless person, lived with a Nazi, French-kissed a “little old lady” and stayed with a prostitute and her family.</p>
<p>All in the name of comedy. Guy goes all out.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday, the comedian was presented with the Oracle Award at the British GQ Men of the Year event, only to receive some flak after joking that Hugo Boss &quot;made uniforms for the Nazis.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nazis did have flaws,&quot; he joked. &quot;But, you know, they did look f-cking fantastic, let&rsquo;s face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/russell-brand-nazi-joke"></a></figure>
<p>To some, this was a more inappropriate comment that Brand&#8217;s previously stated desire to <a href="/2013/04/russell-brand-to-the-kardashians-lets-have-a-foursome/">have a KKK threesome</a>.</p>
<p>According to Brand&#8217;s Twitter recounting of the fallout from this quip, the magazine&#8217;s editor asked him to leave a post-awards party, as the comedian wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;GQ editor: &lsquo;What you did was very offensive to Hugo Boss.&rsquo; Me: &lsquo;What Hugo Boss did was very offensive to the Jews.&rsquo; #GQAwards #nazitailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere, <a href="/2011/01/more-jesse-james-nazi-pics-revealed/">Jesse James totally didn&#8217;t understand</a> why this joke was considered offensive.</p>

Even if she covers herself up a lot more than male fans may be used to.</p>

<p>In the issue, <a href="http://www.vogue.com/magazine/article/beauty-and-the-beat-katy-perrys-first-vogue-cover/">she opens up</a> about the men in her life, past and present.</p>
<p>Of her former husband Russell Brand, she says the day he decided to divorce her &#8211; 12/31/11 &#8211; was the last time she&#8217;s heard from him in any capacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a very smart man. I was in love with him when I married him,&#8221; Perry says. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say I haven&#8217;t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Divorcing someone via text? SMH and ROFL at that one, Russ.</p>
<p>More <a href="/gallery/stars/katy-perry/">Katy Perry photos</a> and dish on John Mayer after the jump &#8230;</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I mean, I have to claim my own responsibility in things,&#8221; she admits, when asked what led to the couple&#8217;s breakup after less than a year and a half.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do admit that I was on the road a lot. Although I invited him time and time again, and I tried to come home as much as I possibly could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw that in the movie [Katy Perry: Part of Me]. That wasn&#8217;t edited to leave footage out &#8230; there simply wasn&#8217;t any footage of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katy says Russell also couldn&#8217;t &#8220;handle&#8221; her being his &#8220;equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting,&#8221; she reveals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can&#8217;t disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like: This isn&#8217;t because of me; this is beyond me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I let go. I have moved on from that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The real truth??! What the what?!</p>
<p>Regarding her relationship with John Mayer, she says she&#8217;s not just romancing some <a href="/stars/john-mayer.html">douchebag</a> with a penchant for promiscuity to get back at Brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not at all. No, I was madly in love with him. I still am madly in love with him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All I can say about that is that he&#8217;s got a beautiful mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautiful mind, tortured soul,&#8221; adds the 28-year-old pop superstar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do have to figure out why I am attracted to these broken birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed. Let us know when you figure that one out, KP.</p>

<p>Katy Perry is unloading the mansion she bought while she was married to Russell Brand, nine months after the pair finalized their July 2012 divorce.</p>
<p>According to real estate site Zillow, Perry had been trying to sell the 1920s-era home under the radar, but is now listing it publicly for $6.925 million.</p>

<p>Records indicate that the former lovebirds purchased the property for $6.5 million in June 2011. They reportedly planned to redo it and then move in.</p>
<p>Of course, Brand filed for divorce six months later, putting the kibosh on that idea &#8230; but for that hefty price, you can make it your own any minute now!</p>

<p>Built in the early 1920s, the <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katy-perry-selling-mansion-she-bought-with-russell-brand-for-6925-million-picture-201394">two-story home sits</a> on three acres of land near the celebrity hotspot Chateau Marmont in the famed Hollywood Hills.</p>
<p>In addition to the main house, Zillow reports, the gated estate features a carriage house, a garden, and a gorgeous pool, complete with a waterfall.</p>
<p>Visitors enter through a stately stone foyer with stained-glass windows, a sweeping staircase, and arched doorways, which lead off into other areas.</p>
<p>Included in the 8,300-square foot home are seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a huge, four-room master suite, two guest suites, and staff quarters.</p>

<p>So, you can own a part of <a href="/stars/katy-perry/">Katy Perry</a>, 28, who is releasing a new album this year.</p>
<p>She also recently split from singer/songwriter <a href="/stars/john-mayer.html">John Mayer</a>, thank goodness.</p>
