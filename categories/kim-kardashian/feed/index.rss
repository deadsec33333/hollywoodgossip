<p>Kim Kardashian tackled a very sensitive subject with her family.</p>



<p>On <em>The Kardashians</em>, Khloe threw a birthday bash for Tristan&#8217;s brother, Amari.</p>



<p>While Khloe seeks to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hide her children from reality</a> in some ways, she and Kim both agree that they want their kids to know Amari &#8212; and others who are not like him.</p>



<p>In a delicate parenting moment, Kim did ask her kids if she felt &#8220;a little bit scared&#8221; attending her cousins&#8217; 18-year-old uncle&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-khloe-kardashian-threw-a-birthday-party-for-amari-thompson">Khloe Kardashian threw a birthday party for Amari Thompson</h2>



<p>During the most recent episode of <em>The Kardashians</em> on Hulu, the titular Kardashians celebrated a birthday.</p>



<p>Despite some <em>birthday discourse</em> earlier this season, Khloe threw the party. It was not for one of her famous sisters.</p>



<p>Instead, the birthday party was for Tristan Thompson&#8217;s brother. Amari, who has Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/07/khloe-kardashian-reveals-sons-face-everyone-meet-tatum-hes-so-cute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come up before on the show</a>.</p>

<p>On the Thursday, April 3 episode, Khloe commented about how small children do not always know how to react to someone with disabilities.</p>



<p>“My kids are much more exposed to Amari than some of the other kids,&#8221; the mother of two acknowledged. &#8220;So True is more concerned than frightened of Amari.&#8221;</p>



<p>Khloe very accurately added: “But I do think it is important for our kids &#8212; and everyone’s kids &#8212; to be exposed to all different types of people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-where-kim-kardashian-weighed-in">This is where Kim Kardashian weighed in</h2>



<p>Kim Kardashian, whose children are a little older, chimed in: “I love our kids growing up around him and helping him.&#8221;</p>



<p>She continued, noting: “They have lots of questions and at times they might not be the most comfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim emphasized: &#8220;But I think it is so important that they play with him and they really get to know him.”</p>

<p>Later, Kim directly asked 6-year-old daughter Chicago if she and her friends felt &#8220;a little bit scared.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then stressed: “But it is OK if you are.”</p>



<p>Most 6-year-olds do not attend 18th birthday parties for people to whom they are related. However, the party went on without any apparent incident &#8212; until Amari&#8217;s brief seizure. </p>



<p>Kris Jenner seemed the most distressed by that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-lgs-like">What is LGS like?</h2>



<p>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare but severe epilepsy disorder that manifests during childhood. While about 95% of those with LGS survive into adulthood, the condition has numerous associations &#8212; including cognitive impairment, brain malformations, and even tumors.</p>



<p>Many with LGS suffer seizures almost daily. This is part of Amari&#8217;s life. </p>



<p>Tristan Thompson stepped up to care for his brother after his mother, Andrea, passed away in January 2023. </p>

<p>Kanye West is running his mouth again.</p>



<p>And as usual, the unhinged rapper is burning every bridge in sight and doing his best to destroy his family.</p>



<p>Yes, once again, Kanye has done on the attack against his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.</p>



<p>And once again, the insults he&#8217;s directed at the mother of his children are shockingly brutal.</p>

<p>And over the weekend, he gave a long, bizarre interview with DJ Akademiks in which he took more shots at his ex.</p>



<p>At one point in the conversation, Ye donned a black Ku Klux Klan robe and calmly revealed that he never wanted to have kids with Kim.</p>

<p>“When you speak about Kim, people might be like, ‘Well, you picked her.

<p>“Absolutely, I did. That was my fault. No, that was my fault,&#8221; Ye replied.</p>



<p>“I didn’t want to have children with this person after the first two months of being with them, but that wasn’t God’s plan.”</p>



<p>Kanye didn&#8217;t go into detail or reveal <em>why</em> he changed his mind and decided to have four kids with Kim.</p>



<p>The youngest two were born via surrogate, so he can hardly claim that their pregnancies were accidental.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-continues-to-publicly-implode">Kanye continues to publicly implode</h2>

<p>As for the older kids, they&#8217;re 11 and 7 now &#8212; in other words, old enough to comprehend the insanity of this situation.</p>



<p>Kanye&#8217;s current meltdown has, sadly, affected his kids on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>Insiders say Kim was recently forced to cancel a visit between Kanye and eldest daughter North after learning that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/andrew-tate-accuser-claims-he-recorded-podcast-with-kanye-west-before-assault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tristan and Andrew Tate would also be present</a>.</p>



<p>The Tates are currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kanye chose a side in the ongoing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake feud</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;One thing is, Drake is a million times better than Kendrick and a million times more important,&#8221; he said of the rappers. </p>



<p>&#8220;What Future has done, [Young] Thug, Drake, culturally. That s&#8211;t last year, I could barely sit through that s&#8211;t. That s&#8211;t was insane, bro,&#8221; Kanye continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had Lucian Grainge, Universal, Drake lawsuit s&#8211;t written all over it. At the end of the day, all this s&#8211;t I&#8217;m saying – Jim Jones, Kendrick, all these celebrities – the funny thing is we&#8217;re all in the same boat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kanye also compared Drake to imprisoned mogul Diddy, but in Ye&#8217;s world, that&#8217;s a compliment.</p>



<p>Needless to say, he&#8217;s dug himself a very deep hole this time.</p>

<p>There was a time when Kanye West&#8217;s tirades were more funny than disturbing.</p>



<p>Those days are long gone, of course, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-jay-z-is-gonna-kill-me-for-insulting-his-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s current meltdown</a> is revealing the severity of his bigotry and mental illness.</p>



<p>The situation has certainly complicated the life of anyone with ties to Kanye, especially his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, who has four kids with the disgraced rapper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-s-behavior-raises-custody-questions">Kanye&#8217;s behavior raises custody questions</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Kim and Kanye have clashed publicly about his behavior toward their children, particularly his decision to collaborate with daughter North on a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">song featuring vocals from accused sex offender Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye not only shared screenshots of angry text messages he received from Kim, he also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused the entire Kardashian family of sex trafficking</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Dr. Phil has become the latest celebrity to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bethenny-frankel-to-kim-kardashian-you-need-to-protect-your-children-from-kanye-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caution Kim that she needs to take action</a> before it&#8217;s too late.</p>



<p>Otherwise, Phil warns, Kim&#8217;s kids could wind up in foster care.</p>

<p>“If you need an emergency intervention, then you get an emergency intervention,” he said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOr_Xdtzo8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>’s “2 Angry Men” podcast Wednesday. “What we don’t want is for these children to wind up in foster care because that system is broken.”</p>



<p>Phil explained that in a case this extreme, Kim and Kanye&#8217;s billions of dollars might not be enough to protect their family against government intervention.</p>



<p>“If you think, ‘Well, with this kind of money, they’re not gonna wind up in foster care,’ well, that’s wrong,” he said.</p>



<p>“If the [Department of Children and Families] gets involved and thinks one parent isn’t reacting while the other is unstable, they will take them,” the TV personality and self-help guru shared.</p>

<p>“Now, they’re likely to place them with family members rather than strangers, but you don’t want these children left hanging out to dry.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-is-in-a-difficult-position">Kim is in a difficult position</h2>



<p>Obviously, Kim has some very difficult decisions to make.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure she&#8217;s very wary of what might happen if she antagonizes Kanye in his current state.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2200268355-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends SNL50: The Anniversary Special on February 16, 2025 in New York City.

<p>But at the same time, if she does nothing, his actions and comments could prompt an investigation.</p>



<p>Ideally, someone who&#8217;s currently close to Kanye would intervene, take his phone away, and encourage him to check into a treatment facility.</p>



<p>But it seems that he&#8217;s pushed just about everyone away, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bianca-censori-stays-with-kanye-west-out-of-fear-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including his wife, Bianca Censori</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye has been behaving erratically for years now, but these days the stakes are higher than ever. And his kids are old enough to understand how frightening the situation is.</p>

<p>Kanye West has been making so many headlines lately that it&#8217;s hard to keep up with all of his repugnant behavior.</p>



<p>In addition to the tweets in which he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-jay-z-is-gonna-kill-me-for-insulting-his-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hurls outrageous slurs at his friends&#8217; children</a>, Kanye has been collaborating with accused criminals and tossing out allegations that could result in real-world harm.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, he hit a new low when he accused his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, of being a sex trafficker.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-accuses-kardashian-family-of-sex-trafficking">Kanye West accuses Kardashian family of sex trafficking</h2>



<p>&#8220;The Kardashians are sex workers and they sex traffic all the blacl [sic] children they strategically produce,&#8221; Kanye tweeted, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Kim Kardashian is a sex trafficker.&#8221; That allegation appears to be a response to the fact that Kim and Kanye&#8217;s eldest daughter North recently appeared in a music video for singer FKA Twigs.</p>



<p>Kanye&#8217;s irritation with the Twigs video is ironic for a number of reasons:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-682x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival - Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-521720" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1186140734-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival &#8211; Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images for Fast Company)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For one thing, he recently used vocals from North on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-hurls-homophobic-slurs-at-drake-calls-kendrick-lamar-a-rapist-praises-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a song featuring imprisoned accused sex trafficker Diddy</a>, which seems like a far more inappropriate project for an 11-year-old.</p>



<p>On top of that, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/19/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-calls-her-sex-trafficker-tate-brothers-north-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reports that Kim was recently forced to pull the plug on a planned father-daughter visit when she learned that Kanye had also invited Andrew and Tristan Tate to his home.</p>



<p>Andrew Tate is awaiting trial on rape charges, and both brothers stand accused of &#8220;creating a criminal organization&#8221; in Romania.</p>



<p>Despite the charges, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/andrew-tate-alleged-rapist-human-trafficker-permitted-to-return-to-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Tates were recently permitted to return to the US</a>. They fled Florida last month after learning that state authorities had launched their own investigation.</p>

<p>The Tate brothers are reportedly residing in Las Vegas at the moment. It&#8217;s unclear where they planned to meet up with Kanye or if the meeting wound up taking place.</p>



<p>TMZ&#8217;s sources note that there&#8217;s an additional layer of irony to Kanye&#8217;s allegations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insiders-point-to-kanye-s-recent-behavior-as-indication-of-mental-illness">Insiders point to Kanye&#8217;s recent behavior as indication of mental illness</h2>



<p>It was only a few weeks ago that Kanye showed up to the Grammys with a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-bianca-censori-headed-for-divorce-in-wake-of-nude-grammys-stunt-pro-nazi-meltdown-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nude Bianca Censori </a>on his arm. </p>



<p>The sources say it&#8217;s more than a little ironic that a man who enjoys parading his naked wife in front of an audience of millions is now accusing Kim Kardashian of sex trafficking.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677460319-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends the Kering Caring For Women Dinner at The Pool on September 12, 2023 in New York City.

<p>Even Kanye&#8217;s remaining supporters are encouraging him to either present some evidence or stop accusing people of crimes as serious as sex trafficking.</p>



<p>Of course, at this point, the rapper seems to be entirely detached from reality, so he&#8217;ll likely continue tweeting whatever pops into his head regardless of whether there are any facts to support his claims.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Kim and company are forced to look and hope that the damage from Kanye&#8217;s latest meltdown will be minimal.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Kanye West is having another meltdown on social media.</p>



<p>And this time, he seems determined to alienate his few remaining friends and supporters.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye went on the attack against Kim Kardashian </a>and her family.</p>

<p>That same day, he released a song on which he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bethenny-frankel-to-kim-kardashian-you-need-to-protect-your-children-from-kanye-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with accused sex trafficker Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kim was upset to learn that vocals from her 11-year-old daughter were also featured on the track.</p>



<p>Kanye responded by lashing out at his ex-wife and publicly sharing screenshots of her text messages.</p>



<p>Today, Ye expanded his focus. </p>



<p>He continued lashing out at Kim (at one point, he tweeted, &#8220;I don’t give a f&#8211;k about that old white lady other than her always pulling bulls&#8211;t with my black children,&#8221;) but he also took shots at several fellow rappers, including Tyler, the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yet-another-tirade-from-kanye">Yet another tirade from Kanye</h2>



<p>He was particularly harsh in his criticism toward Drake, whom he repeatedly referred to using homophobic slurs.</p>



<p>&#8220;I DON’T PERSONALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH KENDRICK (I PROBABLY WILL NOW) BUT HE WAS A PAWN TO TAKE DOWN F&#8211;GOT(AKA DRAKE) BECAUSE THESE RECORD LABELS DONT WANT BIG ARTIST BECAUSE THE SMALLER ARTIST ARE EASIER TO CONTROL AND REPLACE,&#8221; Kanye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK WAS THE INDUSTRY PUPPET THEN THEY WAS DONE WITH HIM,&#8221; he added, in his usual all-caps style.</p>



<p>Kanye went on to say that he hates to give any credit to Drake (whom he continued to refer to with homophobic) before praising a lyric from one of his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick diss tracks</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-directs-his-wrath-toward-kendrick-lamar-defends-diddy">Kanye directs his wrath toward Kendrick Lamar, defends Diddy</h2>



<p>As evidenced by the &#8220;industry puppet&#8221; line, Kanye is also no fan of Kendrick&#8217;s, and he made the extent of his feelings clear today:</p>



<p>&#8220;HATE TO GIVE THIS F&#8211;GOT CREDIT BUT FAVORITE LINE OF THE BATTLE LAST YEAR IS WHEN THE F&#8211;GGOT SAID &#8216;YOU RAP LIKE YOU TRYNA FREE THE SLAVES&#8217; HE DOES,&#8221; Ye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;NOOOOBODY HAS EVER LISTENED TO KENDRICK OR KNOWS ANY OF HIS SONGS,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK SOUND LIKE A RAPIST.&#8221; He offered no additional context for that seemingly unfounded claim.</p>



<p>All of this came on the heels of a bizarre Instagram post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHUV88fyq8E/?img_index=1">The Shade Room</a>, in which Kanye is seen having a lengthy conversation with Diddy, who apparently called him from prison.</p>

<p>Kanye has been defending the disgraced mogul for weeks. Today he wrote that he can&#8217;t understand why so many people are &#8220;MAD AT PUFF [Diddy],&#8221; as everyone &#8220;KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HIT A GIRL.&#8221;</p>



<p>West went on to compare himself to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams, who is currently under a conservatorship</a>. He then stated that he expects to be placed under a 5150 psychiatric hold because of his tweets.</p>



<p>Kenye concluded one of the day&#8217;s many tirades with:</p>



<p>&#8220;I TWEET EVERYTHING I THINK OF.&#8221;</p>



<p>We certainly won&#8217;t argue with him there.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian is considering the nuclear option when it comes to her children.</p>



<p>As previously discussed and detailed, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/">Kanye West released a new track</a> over the weekend titled &#8220;Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The artist&#8217;s daughter, North, has a cameo on this song &#8212; despite Kardashian having strongly voiced her disapproval of North being used in such fashion.</p>



<p>And despite the fact that the former couple&#8217;s divorce agreement says both sides must have an equal say when it comes to making decisions such as this in regard to their children.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, both Kim and Kanye attended a mediation session on Friday with their respective lawyers where they agreed that North would <em><strong>not</strong></em> appear on any version of this song if it were released.</p>



<p>West then went ahead and immediately violated this agreement.</p>



<p>Just before uploading the track on Saturday, the rapper even put up screenshots of alleged text conversations he claims to have had with Kardashian… as the exes went back and forth regarding the trademark of North’s name.</p>



<p>At one point in this exchange, West tells Kardashian “I’m never speaking with you again,” to which Kim replies:</p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!”</p>

<p>West also threatened &#8220;war&#8221; against is ex and said &#8220;neither of us will recover from the public fallout&#8221; if he takes that route, adding: &#8220;You’re going to have to kill me.”</p>



<p>One could argue, of course, that Kanye won&#8217;t recover from many of his recent actions outside of this spat&#8230; considering he&#8217;s just and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">out and proud Nazi at this point</a>.</p>



<p>But anyway.</p>



<p>Back to what Kim is now thinking about in the wake of this legal dispute&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="762" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-762x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-503069" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-762x1024.jpg 762w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-223x300.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-768x1031.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-1525x2048.jpg 1525w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-715x960.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-804x1080.jpg 804w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-894x1200.jpg 894w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180491795-scaled.jpg 1906w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend the WSJ Magazine 2019 Innovator Awards at MOMA on November 6, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reality star is “seriously considering going to court to ask a judge to strip [Kanye] of joint legal custody,” writes TMZ.</p>



<p>To be clear, Kardashian already has <em>physical</em> custody of her children. She has never prevented them from seeing their dad, either.</p>



<p>However, Kim may make this extra move to ensure the safety of her kids and to disassociate them as much as possible from a man who certainly appears to be VERY far off his rocker.</p>



<p>Aside from North, Kim and Kanye share three other kids: Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 5.</p>

<p>West, for his part, has only responded to this latest feud by ranting like a mad man on social media.</p>



<p>“I DONT WANT TO JUST ‘SEE’ MY KIDS. I NEED TO RAISE THEM. I NEED TO HAVE SAY SO OF WEAR [sic] THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE AND WHOSE HOUSES THEY SLEEP OVER WEATHER [sic] MY DAUGHTERS WEAR LIPSTICK AND PERFUME,” he wrote via X on Saturday, March 15. </p>



<p>“ALL THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ME BY THE KARDASHIAN MOB, HULU AND DISNEY AND THE BIGGER AGENDA TO USE THE SELECTIVELY BRED BLACK CHILDREN TO BE PLATFORMS TO INFLUENCE BLACK PEOPLE.”</p>



<p>And when it comes to issues such as his daughter appearing on a rap song?</p>



<p>&#8220;THE MAN MAKES THE FINAL DECISION, West added.</p>



<p>The guy is such a sweetheart, isn&#8217;t he?</p>

<p>Kanye West returned to social media over the weekend.</p>



<p>And in keeping with tradition, he immediately began spouting nonsense and sparking new concerns about his mental health.</p>



<p>This time, it was Kanye&#8217;s ex-wife and his former in-laws who took the brunt of his wrath.</p>



<p>In a move that was both surprising and baffling, Kanye aired his dirty laundry by posting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots of text messages he&#8217;d received from Kim Kardashian</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-and-kanye-s-war-over-north">Kim and Kanye&#8217;s war over North</h2>



<p>In the conversation, the exes argued over West&#8217;s decision to include daughter North in a song he made with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/diddy-hearing-bloated-gray-haired-mogul-enters-not-guilty-plea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced rapper Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kim was understandably not pleased that her daughter was featured on a track with one of the world&#8217;s most notorious (alleged) sex criminals.</p>



<p>Her efforts to block the song&#8217;s release might have been successful, as it&#8217;s no longer available online.</p>



<p>But while Kim might prefer to handle these matters by reaching out to Kanye directly, one fellow divorcee says that that&#8217;s a huge mistake.</p>

<p>Bethenny Frankel likes to offer hot takes on social media, and this time, she&#8217;s urging Kim to be very careful in her dealings with Kanye.</p>



<p>Frankel explained that she&#8217;s &#8220;an expert on all matters divorce and custody&#8221; due to her messy split from Jason Hoppy.</p>



<p>“Kim is texting Kanye, who is not a rational person, and she’s texting him as if he’s a rational person,&#8221; she said this week.</p>



<p>“She should not be speaking to him at all. She should be speaking to him by proxy,” Bethenny continued. </p>



<p>“Someone else should be the one interacting with him because, again, he’s not rational. He’s sharing her texts, and that’s a violation.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-north-gets-caught-in-the-middle">North gets caught in the middle</h2>



<p>In the texts, Kim says she trademarked North&#8217;s name in order to exert control over her public image and prevent stunts like Kanye&#8217;s latest.</p>



<p>“I’m never speaking with you again,” Kanye wrote in one of his messages to Kim.</p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!” she replied.</p>



<p>“When she’s 18, [the trademark] goes to her. So stop,” Kim added. “I sent paperwork over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song to protect her.”</p>



<p>“Amend it or I’m going to war. And neither of us will recover from the public fallout. You’re going to have to kill me,&#8221; Kanye ominously shot back.</p>



<p>Bethenny cautioned Kim that the trademark she&#8217;s so fond of might not be as powerful as she hopes.</p>

<p>“If Kim has decision making, it’s irrational whether or not she has the trademark for her daughter … because a judge doesn’t care about trademarks as much,&#8221; Frankel explained.</p>



<p>She added that judges dealing with custody matters are “always focused on what is in the best interest of the child, even if their agreement says something otherwise.”</p>



<p>It seems obvious that Kanye presents a danger to his kids&#8217; mental health and sense of stability.</p>



<p>But he&#8217;s unlikely to see it that way. So Kim might eventually be forced to plead her case to a judge, instead of to her ex.</p>



<p>In the meantime, she should probably follow Bethenny&#8217;s advice and limit contact with Kanye.</p>

<p>As we&#8217;re guessing you&#8217;ve heard by now, Kanye West has been off his rocker for awhile.</p>



<p>The rapper has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-begs-donald-trump-to-pardon-diddy-launches-bizarre-anti-semitic-rant-on-x/">declared himself to be a Nazi</a> and has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-im-a-billionaire-and-i-have-total-control-over-my-wife/">said he controls his wife</a> and basically issued one far right, nonsensical and insane statement after another for the last couple years.</p>



<p>West hasn&#8217;t really said anything about ex-spouse Kim Kardashian, however.</p>



<p>Until now.</p>

<p>On March 15, the troubled artist ranted and raved on social media over theownership of any trademarks related to the pair&#8217;s daughter North West’s name.</p>



<p>West did so amid a series of posts to Twitter&#8230; one of which included a new song featuring Diddy, Diddy’s son Christian “King” Combs and West’s oldest child with Kardashian.</p>



<p>Kanye shared the track, titled “LONELY ROADS STILL GO TO SUNSHINE,” directly to the social media account, even though &#8212; as TMZ writes &#8212; Kardashian tried to get a judge to <em>stop</em> this release from ever taking place.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to blame the reality star, considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/">Diddy has been arrested for sex trafficking</a> and other truly awful charges.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim and Kanye throwback" class="wp-image-503068" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1199768924-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party following the 92nd Oscars at The Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills on February 9, 2020. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jean-Baptiste Lacroix / AFP) (Photo by JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to TMZ insiders, Kardashian sent out legal notices “demanding a cease &amp; desist” in regard to this single and had an “emergency hearing with a mediator and a judge,” which prompted West to promise he would not make the song public.</p>



<p>So it sounds as if he lied.</p>



<p>Just before uploading the track on Saturday, meanwhile, the rapper put up screenshots of alleged text conversations he claims to have had with Kardashian&#8230; as the exes go back and forth regarding the trademark of North’s name.</p>



<p>At one point in this exchange, West tells Kardashian “I’m never speaking with you again,&#8221; to which Kim replies: </p>



<p>“I asked u at the time if I can trademark her name You said yes when she’s 18 it goes to her so stop I sent paper work over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song To protect her One person has to trademark!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024." class="wp-image-516509" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181946235-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kim Kardashian attends the LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by ETIENNE LAURENT/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kim continued writing that the former spouses agreed when their kids were born that Kardashian would get their children’s names and trademarks “so no one else would take them.” </p>



<p>West didn&#8217;t counter this point, but allegedly replied: </p>



<p>“Amend it or I’m going to war And neither of us will recover from the public fallout You’re going to have to kill me.”</p>



<p>Kanye then asked his followers for their opinion on all of this ugliness.</p>



<p>For her part, Kim has not responded in public to the spat, but she previously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kim-kardashian-breaks-divorce-silence-kanye-is-a-changed-and-awful-man/">said on an episode of The Kardashians</a> that West was &#8220;not the same person&#8221; she married and added of their divorce:</p>



<p>“It’s [tough] when you don’t want your marriage to end off of personal reasons but circumstances change that force your marriage to end.</p>



<p>“When you weren’t planning on that and that’s not really the outcome you want but there’s no other option, I think it makes it harder to get over.”</p>

<p>Are Jonathan Cheban and Kim Kardashian still friends? Still <em>besties</em>?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kim-kardashian-diamond-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drama on <em>The Kardashians</em></a> feels like a natural continuation of KUWTK. But one piece of Kim&#8217;s life has seemed to be missing recently.</p>



<p>Where is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/04/jonathan-cheban-is-kim-kardashians-bestie-hiding-secret-love-chi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her bestie</a>, alleged celebrity Jonathan Cheban?</p>



<p>Did they have a falling out? Did they simply drift apart after she became a mother of four?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-kim-kardashian-and-jonathan-cheban-still-friends">Are Kim Kardashian and Jonathan Cheban still friends?</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, March 11, Jonathan Cheban spoke to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/are-kim-kardashian-and-jonathan-cheban-still-friends-foodgod-dishes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> about Kim Kardashian and more.</p>



<p>“People post me in things and people say that Kim and I aren’t friends anymore,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;And it’s so funny to watch this stuff ‘cause we are friends and we talk all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cheban continued: “I see all these things that pop up and that’s how I know if I’m on [episodes of <em>The Kardashians</em>] or not.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Jonathan Cheban on November 22, 2024." class="wp-image-521302" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_02-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jonathan Cheban attends amfAR Las Vegas Presented By Paramount at Wynn Las Vegas on November 22, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ethan Miller/Getty Images for amfAR)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Jonathan Cheban admits that he does not always watch <em>The Kardashians</em>, he does keep up with Kim Kardashian off-screen.</p>



<p>“We’re going to be friends forever &#8212; and it’s fun,” he affirmed. He then acknowledged: “I mean, she’s got so many kids and so many things to do and I’m all the way on this coast.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cheban continued: &#8220;So it’s like, yeah, we don’t see each other as much. But we talk all the time and anything happens that I feel like we should discuss, we just send it right away.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-kardashian-and-jonathan-cheban-maintain-a-friendship-around-their-busy-schedules">Kim Kardashian and Jonathan Cheban maintain a friendship around their busy schedules</h2>



<p>Jonathan Cheban does, in fact, live on the East Coast. He notes that he travels &#8220;all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of those visits take him to California. But other trips take him to Italy. He&#8217;s been in New York most recently.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, of course, Kim Kardashian lives on the opposite coast from Jonathan Cheban. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jonathan Cheban on September 6, 2024." class="wp-image-521303" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0313_jonathancheban_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jonathan Cheban attends The Daily Front Row&#8217;s 11th Annual Fashion Media Awards at The Rainbow Room on September 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for The Daily Front Row)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is pretty iconic,” Cheban gushed when speaking about the opening of Planet Hollywood in NYC.</p>



<p>“Not only is the weather amazing, I mean, this is such a major thing to happen in New York [and] for a New York comeback,&#8221; he gushed. &#8220;I’m moving back to New York after five years. I’m so excited to be here, this is awesome.”</p>



<p>It seems that, by and large, Cheban hoped to promote the restaurant opening. The Kim questions were merely part of the package.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/seriouslypopular?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#seriouslypopular</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyMail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DailyMail</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MailOnline?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MailOnline</a> do you know this guy??

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-you-know-this-guy">&#8216;Do you know this guy??&#8217;</h2>



<p>By far, the most memorable Jonathan Cheban moment does not involve Kim Kardashian. Rather, it involves <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/martha-stewart-disses-golden-bachelorette/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cultural icon Martha Stewart</a>.</p>



<p>In 2016, she publicly <a href="https://x.com/MarthaStewart/status/745685639153197057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> who he was, adding that &#8220;he says he is well known.&#8221; Ouch!</p>



<p>Truly an indelible moment involving this seemingly <em>delible </em>man.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian lost a massive diamond at a garishly expensive event.</p>



<p>Years ago, Kim famously lost a valuable earring while swimming in water. It led to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kourtney-kardashian-earring-quote-kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-callback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney&#8217;s biggest meme</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/kim-kardashian-still-traumatized-by-robbery-1-year-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life experience</a> has taught her to wear less jewelry. With some exceptions.</p>



<p>One exception was a $600 million wedding. And that&#8217;s a <em>lowball </em>estimate of the cost of the event that cost Kim a sizable diamond.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kim-kardashian-was-all-decked-out-in-jewels">Kim Kardashian was all decked out in jewels</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, March 13 <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/7840bf30-f440-48d4-bf81-55d8cb24457a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <em>The Kardashians</em>, Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian went all out in diamond jewelry and more.</p>



<p>The Season 6, Episode 6 storyline followed the famous sisters as they attended the wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant.</p>



<p>The 6-day wedding took place in July of 2024 in Mumbai, India. Neither sister had met the groom or the bride, both scions of extraordinarily wealthy business families. But they received invitations for at least two of the days of celebration.</p>

<p>On <em>The Kardashians</em>, Kim and Khloe Kardashian showed off their luxurious rooms. Some of the extravagant piece of jewelry on display were designed by Lorraine Schwartz, who is a friend to the sisters and also designs pieces for the Ambani family.</p>



<p>Kim, on the second night of the event, wore a massive necklace that was dripping with teardrop diamonds.</p>



<p>Both Kardashian sisters rubbed elbows at the event, but when Kim realized that she was missing a diamond, the two flew into a panic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hunt-for-the-diamond-begins">The hunt for the diamond begins!</h2>



<p>Khloe Kardashian called over Schwartz to point out &#8220;this is missing,&#8221; indicating that Kim had lost a diamond. The hunt began.</p>



<p>Speaking to the confessional camera, Kim detailed how much was gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was like the big diamond necklace, like a bib, and then there were pearls and big pear-shaped diamonds hanging from it,&#8221; Kim described. We are unsure if Schwartz would have characterized it as a <em>bib</em>, but we are not professional jewelers.</p>

<p>As if attempting to retrace steps, Khloe recalled: &#8220;I think when we were talking to the sister, the diamond fell.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sure enough, there was slow-motion footage of the diamond falling to the ground.</p>



<p>Kim described the hunt for the diamond: &#8220;We&#8217;re looking all over the floor, trying to see where it went, looking in my top, looking in my skirt. It&#8217;s nowhere to be found.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-loving-memory">&#8216;In loving memory&#8217;</h2>



<p>Despite a detailed search, the jeweled teardrop never turned up. Kim and Khloe Kardashian opted to do a photoshoot with some beautiful flowers, despite the missing diamond.</p>



<p>In retrospect, Khloe joked that Kim &#8220;hasn&#8217;t thought about it since.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kim insisted: &#8220;I felt bad in the moment.&#8221; The episode included a cheeky title card reading: &#8220;In Loving Memory of The Ambani Wedding Diamond.&#8221; <em>Goofy</em>.</p>
