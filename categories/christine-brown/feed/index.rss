<p>Christine Brown would like to her set her romantic record straight.</p>



<p>And maybe have a laugh at your expense while she&#8217;s at it.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star, as you likely know well, walked away from spiritual spouse Kody Brown in November 2021 and married David Woolley about two years later.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="669" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Christine Brown and David Woolley." class="wp-image-511968" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy.jpg 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy-300x248.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/rs_1024x694-241024104808-Screenshot_2024-10-24_134740-copy-768x636.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown has found her soulmate. His name is David Woolley.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine has gushed and gushed &#8212; and then gushed some more &#8212; about Woolley ever since, referring to him as her soulmate on more than one occasion.</p>



<p>“Every step of my journey brought me here,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">Brown captioned pictures</a> of the couple with their backs to the camera this past June, for example.</p>



<p>“Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.”</p>



<p>Despite all Christine and David have said about each other, the Internet is gonna Internet, you know?</p>



<p>By which we mean the following: Many folks out there think the couple is headed for a divorce.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-05-at-11.38.40%E2%80%AFAM-1024x661.png" alt="Christine Brown on TLC with David Woolley" class="wp-image-489677"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown gesture here at David Woolley during his first Sister Wives appearance.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a video posted to Instagram on February 12, the TLC personality shared a photo of herself posing and smiling, along with the onscreen message: </p>



<p>“When I read that David and I are not happy.”</p>



<p>The upload was followed by a series of short clips and images of the couple smiling and laughing together, hopefully putting split rumors to rest.</p>



<p>In case it didn&#8217;t do the job, however, Christine went ahead and assured her followers that all is well between the spouses in the caption of the post.</p>



<p>“I’m always surprised with what I read about myself,” the mother of six added. “Don’t you worry, we couldn’t be happier.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="901" height="686" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg 901w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-768x585.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown is all smiles in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s been clear for awhile now that Christine is full steam ahead.</p>



<p>She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/christine-brown-weight-loss-photos-look-im-down-40-pounds/">has lost 40 pounds</a> and she&#8217;s about to embark on a career as an author.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives cast member is coming out with an autobiography that will be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em>. </p>



<p>It has been described as &#8220;gritty and honest&#8221; by the star herself.</p>



<p>And its publisher has teased the book as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism — and the only life she’s known — behind.”</p>

<p>According to Amazon, the book will be available to purchase on September 16, 2025. Also according to Amazon, this is the official synopsis:</p>



<p><em>Becoming Kody Brown’s third wife in 1994, Christine finally found the big, happy family she had hoped for. When TLC’s hit show Sister Wives premiered in 2010, Christine knew it was her chance to shine a light on the brighter side of polygamy—the helping hands, the lively discussions, and their unmatched devotion to each other.</em></p>



<p><em>But the cameras also revealed a much darker truth.</em></p>



<p><em>In this candid tell-all, Christine shares for the first time the journey that led her away from the Morman church and the bold path she is carving to live apart from all she has ever known.</em></p>



<p><em>Moving, genuine, and insightful, this is a uniquely powerful tour de force of Christine’s journey toward and beyond her time in the spotlight as a sister wife.</em><br></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got it, you should flaunt it, right?</p>



<p>Or, when it comes to Christine Brown at the moment, if you <em>no longer have it</em>, you should go ahead and flaunt it, right?!?</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star has shed quite a lot of weight of late and took to Instagram this week in order to show off her new, impressive figure.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-12-at-4.07.34%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-519118"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown has lost 40 pounds. The Sister Wives star flaunts said weight loss here.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I’m down 40 pounds and feeling better than ever!&#8221; Brown captioned a montage of photos on February 10.</p>



<p>&#8220;What’s better, is that the weight actually has stayed off. No more yo-yo dieting, no more feeling drained—just real, lasting results. I finally have hunger control and the energy I was missing, and it feels amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Christine added:</p>



<p>&#8220;If you’re ready to take control of your health, join me for my next weight loss challenge! Drop RESET in the comments, and I’ll send you the details.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also used the hashtag #Plexus, which makes us sad.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/christine-brown-aims-to-empower-women-promotes-shady-supplement-business/">shady weight loss supplement</a> has not been approved by the FDA.</p>



<p>However, both <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/janelle-brown-earns-prestigious-business-award-outpaces-bff-in-supplement-sales/">Christine and Janelle Brown have served as spokespeople</a> for the company, which many observers have compared in the past to an unfair pyramid scheme.</p>



<p>In general these days, Christine is all about evolving as a human being.</p>



<p>She dumped Kody Brown in November 2021 and married David Woolley in October 2023 and also wrote this week on social media:</p>



<p>&#8220;My journey shows that change is possible. If you feel confined by silence, know that every little step brings you closer to a brighter tomorrow. Let’s move forward together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine is clearly very happy with her decision to leave her selfish spouse.</p>



<p>She plans on sharing a great deal of insight about her life and her relationships in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christine-brown-tell-all-confirmed-how-concerned-should-kody-be/">an upcoming memoir</a>.</p>



<p>Theautobiography will be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em> and has been described by its publisher as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism — and the only life she’s known — behind.”</p>



<p>It will go on sale on September 16.</p>

<p>It really is happening, Sister Wives fans.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Christine Brown spoke out for the first time about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christine-brown-tell-all-confirmed-how-concerned-should-kody-be/">her upcoming memoir</a>, telling Instagram followers how they can preorder the book&#8230; prior to delving into what we can expect from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is gritty and honest as I tell my story living polygamy as a child, to my marriage and family life. It shows my heartache with leaving religion and my marriage to FINALLY meeting [<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley">David Woolley</a>],&#8221; Brown wrote as a caption to a number of photos of her in a red blazer.</p>



<p>One of the photos Christine posted will be used on the book&#8217;s cover, she teased.</p>



<p>Christine’s autobiography will be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em> and has been described by its publisher as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism — and the only life she’s known — behind.”</p>



<p>According to Amazon, it will be available to purchase on September 16, 2025.</p>

<p>Via this Instagram message, Christine explained that she worked with a writer, although every word in the book came out of her mouth.</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I’m grateful to @simonandschuster for believing in my book and publishing it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kody Brown and Christine got spiritually married in 1994, but have never had any legal obligations to each other.</p>



<p>The latter walked away from her polygamous spouse in November 2021, claiming in subsequent interviews that Kody clearly favored wife Robyn and that he simply didn&#8217;t pay her enough attention.</p>

<p>Christine went on to marry Woolley in October 2023. She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-blasts-kody-hes-a-deadbeat-dad/">seems VERY happy these days</a> with these life choices.</p>



<p>“Christine’s decision to leave comes with a great deal of sadness,” Kody wrote three-plus years ago after Christine confirmed she was done with him.</p>



<p>“We enjoyed many years together and I have a large amount of respect and admiration for her. Although we are moving forward on different paths, we will always remain committed parents.”</p>



<p>From what we can gather, the former spouses no longer have any contact.</p>

<p>Those ties can take the form of regrets, her beloved children, or &#8230; their spiritual marriage.</p>



<p>The marriage is over. But after Meri sought an official spiritual divorce, Janelle wonders if she should do the same.</p>



<p>She has opinions on the topic. So does Christine. And neither of these <em>Sister Wives</em> stars sees eye-to-eye with Robyn on the matter.</p>

<p>On the Sunday, February 2 episode of <em>Sister Wives</em>, Janelle Brown set off on her cross-country trip. Having bought land in North Carolina, she was finally ready to make her move. And to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/janelle-brown-im-moving-on-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move on</a>.</p>



<p>She did not go alone. Christine Brown and her husband, David Woolley, accompanied her on the drive across all of the way from Mountain Time to <s>normal</s> East Coast time.</p>



<p>On their journey, Christine and Janelle discussed their ended marriages to Kody Brown. In addition to debating the significance of spiritual divorce, they also discussed Meri&#8217;s similar split from their mutual ex.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Meri well,&#8221; Janelle Brown expressed. She aspired: &#8220;I really do hope, like, I really want all the good things for her because I feel like she&#8217;s been through the wringer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though Kody put Christine and Janelle <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christine-brown-tell-all-confirmed-how-concerned-should-kody-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through so much</a> during their erstwhile plural marriage, Meri seemed to be having a rough time long before this.</p>



<p>Christine then affirmed: &#8220;I hope she can get in a loving relationship.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-janelle-get-a-spiritual-release-from-kody-like-meri-did">Should Janelle get a &#8216;spiritual release&#8217; from Kody like Meri did?</h2>



<p>Though all three women were married to Kody, only his marriage to Meri had any legal recognition. That ended when they two obtained a legal &#8212; but not spiritual &#8212; divorce so that he could marry Robyn and adopt her children.</p>



<p>Meri received a spiritual release from the marriage through the Brown family&#8217;s former church. And Janelle wondered if she should follow in her footsteps.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know Meri has just recently gotten a release like what we call a release, which is a divorce. And it&#8217;s made me think, &#8216;Huh, I kind of like the idea of getting a spiritual release,'&#8221; Janelle told the confessional camera. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t even know who to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>During his own confessional, Kody took a brief break from whining about his shattered Coyote Pass dreams to discuss conscious uncoupling from Janelle.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Meri, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Christine,&#8221; the reality TV villain listed.</p>



<p>Kody then continued: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some kind of karmic connection that Janelle and I are obligated to still.&#8221;</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">When faced with Robyn&#8217;s explanation that a spiritual release isn&#8217;t final until an ex-wife sleeps with a new man, Janelle commented: &#8220;I just think that&#8217;s bulls&#8211;t, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle continued: &#8220;I mean, I think that&#8217;s dogmatic. That&#8217;s a dogma I used to hear and I used to be like, &#8216;OK, whatever.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Simply put, she didn&#8217;t want to have sex just to finalize a spiritual divorce. And Christine gave a tongue-in-cheek: &#8220;Go have sex with somebody, then that marriage is over. You can move on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Note to Kody Brown: You may wanna sign off the Internet in the near future.</p>



<p>Heck, you may wanna go live under a rock for a number of years.</p>



<p>In a seismic announcement made by our friends today at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, we&#8217;ve learned that <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/01/29/exclusive-sister-wives-star-christine-brown-has-written-a-tell-all-book-get-all-the-details/">Christine Brown has</a> ALREADY WRITTEN A MEMOIR.</p>



<p>This celebrity gossip website reports that the book will come out in the fall &#8212; and will chronicle Christine&#8217;s many years as part of Kody Brown&#8217;s polygamous family unit.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="901" height="686" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy.jpg 901w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-300x228.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/ccss-copy-768x585.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown is all smiles in this Sister Wives scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Christine was the first sister wife to leave this situation, telling the public in November 2021 that she was done with Kody.</p>



<p>About two years later, Christine walked down the aisle with David Woolley and has spent a great deal of her time <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-blasts-kody-hes-a-deadbeat-dad/">trashing Kody in a variety</a> of interviews and features.</p>



<p>Christine’s autobiography will allegedly be titled <em>Sister Wife: A Memoir of Faith, Family and Finding Freedom</em> and has been described by its publisher as “a groundbreaking and heartfelt memoir about living in a family like no other and finding the strength to leave Mormonism &#8212; and the only life she’s known &#8212; behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kody and Christine got spiritually married in 1994, but have never had any legal obligations to each other.</p>

<p>“Christine’s decision to leave comes with a great deal of sadness,” Kody wrote back after Christine confirmed she was done with him. </p>



<p>“We enjoyed many years together and I have a large amount of respect and admiration for her. Although we are moving forward on different paths, we will always remain committed parents.”</p>



<p>From what we can gather, the exes no longer have any contact.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/christine-brown-lawsuit-against-kody-deemed-significant-custody-dispute-by-court/">Christine recently sued Kody for child support</a> in regard to their 14-year old daughter.</p>

<p>A search on Amazon, meanwhile, reveals that Christine&#8217;s memoir will go on sale in September.</p>



<p>The description on this platform reads as follows:</p>



<p><em>Becoming Kody Brown’s third wife in 1994, Christine finally found the big, happy family she had hoped for. When TLC’s hit show Sister Wives premiered in 2010, Christine knew it was her chance to shine a light on the brighter side of polygamy—the helping hands, the lively discussions, and their unmatched devotion to each other. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>But the cameras also revealed a much darker truth.</strong></em></p>



<p><em>In this candid tell-all, Christine shares for the first time the journey that led her away from the Morman church and the bold path she is carving to live apart from all she has ever known.</em></p>



<p><em>Moving, genuine, and insightful, this is a uniquely powerful tour de force of Christine’s journey toward and beyond her time in the spotlight as a sister wife.</em></p>

<p>Back in 2013, Christine, Kody, Meri, Janelle and Robyn Brown came together to pen Becoming Sister Wives, a book that told the story of how these sister wives came to be a family.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d have to assume Christine&#8217;s upcoming memoir will be rather critical of such a lifestyle.</p>



<p>The same can be said for Meri&#8217;s eventual tell-all, which this fellow reality star teased last month on TikTok, stating for fans:</p>



<p>“I think they’re wanting to hear the ugly and the nitty gritty and the mean and they want me to throw people under the bus and I’m not going to do that&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re going to get my truth and there are going to be things that will be painful. Yes, people love the drama&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;There will be things that I have no doubt that, when some of my family members read it, will be painful for them but it will be my truth…I might talk pain and experience and what did I learn from it…so that’s how I tell my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christine Brown has made it very clear for a very long time now:</p>



<p>She is done with Kody Brown.</p>



<p>The Sister Wives star walked away from that unhealthy relationship in November 2021 and later married <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley">David Woolley</a> and has not looked back since.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the thing, you guys&#8230;</p>

<p>Christine is done with a couple other people who were once in her close circle, as well.</p>



<p>“I haven’t talked to Meri or Robyn for years, and it’s funny,” Brown said on a recent episode of iHeart’s Rogue Energy podcast. “We’ll just keep it like that. I don’t need to develop a relationship with them.”</p>



<p>The mother of six added that one of the benefits of getting older is that you can decide who you want in your life without much concern or anxiety. </p>



<p>For example? How she didn’t feel bad about not inviting Meri and Robyn to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-snubs-her-sister-wives-no-wedding-invite-for-you/">her wedding to Woolley</a> in October 2023.</p>

<p>“A great thing about being older when you married is that you really only have to invite the people you really want there,” Christine explained on this podcast. </p>



<p>“There’s no obligatory invitations that go out to some Uncle Bob or Uncle Jed, but you’re like, ‘I really don’t want him there. He’s gonna blah, blah, blah. He always this blah, blah, blah.’ We didn’t have to.”</p>



<p>In simple terms?</p>



<p>Christine is living her own, independent life. She isn&#8217;t part of any polygamous unit any longer. And she&#8217;s loving this freedom!</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t exactly been a secret that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/christine-and-meri-sister-wives-friendship/">Christine doesn&#8217;t talk to Meri</a>.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been extremely candid for years now, too, in the way she feels about Robyn &#8212; specifically how Kody has showed such clear favoritism toward her and how this.</p>



<p>“I don’t trust her,” Christine previously said a Sister Wives one-on-one special, referring to Robyn.</p>



<p>“I think she says one thing but does another. How can you say you want the whole big family picture, but then do all these separate things with Kody?</p>



<p>“How can you say you want the whole big family picture when he’s over at your house all the time?”</p>

<p>For the record, Kody is legally married to Robyn and now only married to Robyn overall.</p>



<p>After Christine left him, Janelle Brown also ditched the father of 17 and Meri followed suit in January 2023.</p>



<p>All three women seem much better off at this point, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>

<p>We have an update on Christine Brown suing her ex-husband for child support.</p>



<p>Back in September, we reported that the 52-year old had filed legal documents against the Sister Wives patriarch in which she asked a court to establish paternity of 14-year old daughter Truly because Kody Brown&#8217;s name is not on her birth certificate.</p>

<p>Additionally, Christine has requested a domestic relations injunction that stops both parties from harassment, domestic violence, canceling or modifying services, taking the kids for non-routine travel without court orders or permission and demeaning or disparaging the other party.</p>



<p>Last Wednesday, meanwhile, the exes met in court (via Zoom) for a hearing in regard to this case.</p>



<p>According to court documents obtained by our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Realty Roundup, both sides <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/12/21/exclusive-hearing-held-for-christine-browns-lawsuit-against-ex-kody-brown-sister-wives-stars-case-classified-as-a-significant-custody-dispute/">completed their disclosures</a> for the case at the time and that the exes have now been ordered to attend a mediation conference scheduled for May 21, 2025.</p>



<p>Now, here is where it gets interesting&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="644" height="362" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg" alt="Christine Brown smirks" class="wp-image-508556" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_.jpg 644w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/MV5BMDM2ZTA0ODQtNzFlNy00M2RmLTlhZGQtMWY5MzRjZTcwM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_QL75_UX500_CR019500281_-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown smirks in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The court apparently classified Kody and Christine’s case as having Track 3 status, which is an assignment reserved for a “significant custody dispute.”</p>



<p>Consider the following section from the Utah State Courts website, </p>



<p><em>This category includes cases with significant custody disputes, including custody disputes involving allegations of child abuse or domestic violence. For a Track 3 case, at the case management conference the court and parties will address: </em></p>



<p><em>1) whether a custody evaluation is necessary, and, if so, the form of the evaluation and appointment considerations; and 2) whether appointment of a private guardian ad litem is necessary, and if so, the scope of the appointment and apportionment of costs.</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e.webp 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-300x225.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-768x576.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-728x546.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-480x360.webp 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-320x240.webp 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown appears to be in distress here.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>To be clear, we are not legal experts.</p>



<p>From what we understand, there have been no allegations of child abuse or domestic violence.</p>



<p>Rather, because Christine and Kody&#8217;s marriage was not legal in nature and because Kody is not listed on the aforementioned birth certificate&#8230; Christine cannot make any requests legally binding without this lawsuit/process.</p>



<p>After Christine’s walked away from Kody in November 2021, Truely moved with her mother from Arizona to Utah.</p>



<p>It sounds in our opinion here as if Christine wants to force Kody to actually leave his home in order to see his daughter&#8230; and <em>not</em> be forced on her end to send the teenager to Arizona out of any parental obligation.</p>

<p>Kody and Christine also share children Mykelti, Aspyn, Gwendlyn, Ysabel and Paedon; only Truely is a minor, however.</p>



<p>“When I lived in Flagstaff, I firmly believed that moving to Utah was the best choice for me and for Truely,” Christine explained during a previous episode of Sister Wives.</p>



<p>“I knew that I was taking Truely away from her dad. I felt like the best way to preserve Truely’s relationship with Kody was to move her away from him&#8230;</p>



<p>“I took their relationship while it was still good and I picked it up and I moved it. And then whenever we come back into town, I just pick it up again and I move it back.”</p>

<p>Kody doesn’t seem especially close to his children.</p>



<p>The father of 17&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sister-wives-kody-brown-garrison-death/">wasn’t even talking to son Garrison</a>&nbsp;when the 25-year old committed suicide this past March.</p>



<p>Kody also trashed his ex-wife’s reasoning behind moving away with their teenager via a Sister Wives confessional last autumn.</p>



<p>“For Christine to think that she’s saving my relationship with Truely by taking her away from me and just ‘preserving’ it — that’s such B.S. rationalization,” Kody said on air, emphasizing that the situation was “ridiculous.”</p>



<p>He has not yet responded in public to Christine’s recent lawsuit.</p>

<p>Is David Woolley leaving <em>Sister Wives</em>?</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/christine-brown-and-david-woolley-finally-jet-off-on-honeymoon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David married Christine Brown</a>, he bound himself to a wonderful woman and to her spectacular children (and Paedon). </p>



<p>He also became a public figure overnight, husband to a woman with millions of fans who&#8217;ve followed her story for many years.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a lot to process. And the burdens of the reality TV spotlight aren&#8217;t for everyone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-david-woolley-want-to-film-sister-wives-in-the-first-place">Did David Woolley want to film &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; in the first place?</h2>



<p>A few weeks ago, David Woolley and Christine Brown spoke to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gt8_OZfyGw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a></em> about their marriage &#8212; including its ups and downs.</p>



<p>The two are clearly still head over heels. And, as the interview mentioned, fans are clearly eating up David and Christine&#8217;s love story.</p>



<p>As for David, he simply said: &#8220;Tell me what I need to do, and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; He also admitted that &#8220;it&#8217;s awkward&#8221; filming family interactions.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1024x576.webp" alt="David Woolley and Christine Brown on Sister Wives with pink balloons." class="wp-image-512809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Woolley is featured in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is not the first time that David and Christine have acknowledged that he only films <em>Sister Wives</em> for her.</p>



<p>Like many people &#8212; more than you might think &#8212; David doesn&#8217;t always know what to do when the cameras begin rolling. He didn&#8217;t audition to producers like most reality stars, because his &#8220;audition&#8221; process was dating and marrying Christine.</p>



<p>The tension between an established reality TV personality and a non-famous partner can be intense. This has torn apart multiple relationships, particularly within the <em>Real Housewives</em> franchise.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="393" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/sisterwives5-768x393-1.jpg" alt="David Woolley and Christine Brown on TLC together." class="wp-image-513285" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/sisterwives5-768x393-1.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/sisterwives5-768x393-1-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley appear here on Sister Wives Season 19.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-christine-make-david-film-sister-wives-scenes">Did Christine &#8216;make&#8217; David film &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; scenes?</h2>



<p>Much earlier in 2024, David Woolley joked that Christine Brown had thrown him &#8220;to the wolves,&#8221; leaving him to fend for himself with <em>Sister Wives</em> fans. He was, again, joking.</p>



<p>But, as fans have noted, the joke may have a bit of emotional truth underscoring it. Very few people are actually prepared for what it means for thousands of social media users to tell them what they think of them.</p>



<p>People have accused David of being a fame-seeker, or taking advantage of a &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; post-divorce Christine, and more. Having strangers invent cruel motivations is seldom an easy thing to take.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Christine and David Woolley on Marriage, PET PEEVES and Filming Sister Wives With Kody" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Gt8_OZfyGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Before, David was just doing interviews with Christine. They&#8217;d post social media updates together.</p>



<p>Now, he&#8217;s fully appearing on <em>Sister Wives</em>. While Christine didn&#8217;t &#8220;make&#8221; him do this, he&#8217;s doing this for her sake, even though it&#8217;s outside of his comfort zone.</p>



<p>It makes him uncomfortable and it makes him a target. Will David be leaving <em>Sister Wives</em> if the heat becomes too much? Will the tension tear apart their marriage?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-05-at-11.38.15%E2%80%AFAM-1024x617.png" alt="Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives" class="wp-image-489675"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christine Brown and David Woolley look so cute in this photo from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-being-with-christine-is-probably-enough">Being with Christine is probably enough</h2>



<p>Many people do things for a partner that they wouldn&#8217;t on their own. That can include moving, compromising on a house or decor, on the thermostat, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-vs-kody-brown-sister-wives-stars-to-square-off-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unlike Kody Brown</a>, David seems willing to respect and cherish his wife. He actually appreciates Christine.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s not a &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-i-dont-ever-want-to-see-christine-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basement wife</a>&#8221; anymore. She&#8217;s his wife. And, for now, that means that he shows up on TLC sometimes.</p>

<p>It seems that Mykelti Brown is calling David Woolley &#8220;Papa&#8221; for her kids. </p>



<p>Though she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/mykelti-brown-pregnancy-is-awful-i-am-so-done-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">done having kids</a>, Mykelti is and always will be a mom.</p>



<p>She has Avalon and, as of just a couple of years ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/sister-wives-star-reveals-gender-of-impending-twins-what-is-mykelti-brown-having/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her twins</a>. Those twins just celebrated their shared birthday.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed <em>Sister Wives</em> fans couldn&#8217;t help but notice that Mykelti is using a special honorific for Christine&#8217;s husband. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-mykelti-brown-is-calling-david-woolley-papa-for-her-kids">So, Mykelti Brown is calling David Woolley &#8216;Papa&#8217; for her kids</h2>



<p>In 2022, Mykelti welcomed twin sons Ace and Archer. Recently, the family celebrated their second birthday.</p>



<p>Mykelti shared some of the celebration on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mykeltip/reel/DCfor7rOnkW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. </p>



<p>While her daughter and sons are adorable (and she herself looks so much like Christine!), it was the post about the birthday balloons that really grabbed fans&#8217; attentions.</p>

<script async="" src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>



<p>On her Instagram Story, Mykelti Brown shared a look at birthday balloons that Christine Brown and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">husband David Woolley</a> had sent to celebrate the shared birthday.</p>



<p>The caption on the Story post reads: &#8220;Thank you Oma, Papa, &amp; Truly.&#8221; You can see that Story post in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SisterWives/comments/1gtqhl0/mykelti_calls_david_papa_for_her_kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> screenshot, below.</p>



<p>Fans are inferring that Mykelti is calling David &#8220;Papa&#8221; for her children. And that makes sense in many ways.</p>



<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SisterWives/comments/1gtqhl0/mykelti_calls_david_papa_for_her_kids/">Mykelti calls David “Papa” for her kids?</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ParticularEmploy1137/">u/ParticularEmploy1137</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SisterWives/">SisterWives</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sister-wives-fans-aren-t-surprised">&#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; fans aren&#8217;t surprised</h2>



<p>&#8220;I’m betting that’s what David’s grandkids call him and Mykelti is just using it, as well,&#8221; one Reddit comment reads.</p>



<p>&#8220;We called my Moms boyfriend of over 20 yrs Papa after we started giving my Mom grandkids,&#8221; another redditor shared. &#8220;All 12 of her Grandkids called him Papa.&#8221;</p>



<p>An additional <em>Sister Wives</em> fan on Reddit pointed out: &#8220;And Tony referred to Kody as his name to the kids just an episode or two ago&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1024x576.webp" alt="David Woolley and Christine Brown on Sister Wives with pink balloons." class="wp-image-512809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Untitled-1.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Woolley is featured in this scene from Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As the fans suggested, this makes a lot of sense. David Woolley is Christine Brown&#8217;s husband. By all accounts, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/christine-browns-kids-absolutely-love-david-woolley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine&#8217;s kids love the guy</a>. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kody has spent years alienating family members left and right. That extends not only to his (three!) ex-wives, but also to many of his children.</p>



<p>Kody has also made it extremely clear that he values his marriage to Robyn, his only remaining spouse, above other relationships. When someone makes their priorities clear like that, others tend to believe them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-mykelti-cut-ties-with-kody-brown-forever">Has Mykelti cut ties with Kody Brown forever?</h2>



<p>It is possible &#8212; perhaps even likely, and probably advisable &#8212; that Mykelti will never again have a meaningful relationship with Kody.</p>



<p>However, it is more than possible for children to have more than two pairs of grandparents. Families are complex structures, and there&#8217;s room for many loving grandparents in a grandchild&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>Mykelti and her kids <em>could </em>continue to call David &#8220;Papa&#8221; but also establish ties with Kody in the future. <em>Should </em>they, though? That&#8217;s a question that perhaps only Mykelti can answer.</p>

<p>And&#8230; they&#8217;re&#8230; off.</p>



<p>At last.</p>



<p>Just over a year since they became husband and wife, David Woolley and Christine Brown finally embarked several days on a trip to honor this occasion.</p>



<p>Yes, they went on a honeymoon.</p>

<p>The Sister Wives cast members very recently visited a number of European destinations &#8212; including Barcelona, Spain, and Florence, Italy via a Virgin Voyages Cruise.</p>



<p>And it sure sounds like a grand time was had by all.</p>



<p>“We are finally on our honeymoon!!” Brown wrote on Instagram on November 4, sharing footage of the couple&#8217;s travels&#8230; including a trip to the famous Sagrada Familia. </p>



<p>“Yep, a year later, we just decided to take our time and go when we were ready. We LOVE Barcelona! The architecture, food and people!!”</p>

<p>Brown and Woolley exchanged vows in Moab, Utah in October 2023.</p>



<p>The former, of course, was in a relationship with Kody Brown for well over two decades prior to walking away from the self-centered polygamist in late 2021.</p>



<p>She has pretty much gushed over Woolley ever since the two got together, often referring to him <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/christine-brown-gushes-over-husband-says-david-woolley-is-my-forever-love/">as her soulmate and her forever love</a>.</p>



<p>In a photo uploaded to Instagram in June, the 52-year old shared a snapshot of herself and her husband enjoying a quiet evening while watching the sunset.</p>



<p>“Every step of my journey brought me here,” Brown captioned pictures of the couple with their backs to the camera.</p>



<p>“Watching the sunset with my forever love, grateful for every moment that led us to this beautiful beginning. #NewlyMarried #SunsetViews #GratefulHeart.”</p>

<p>“Florence took my breath away. Masterpieces everywhere!” Christine wrote on her November 11 Instagram video, captioning it as follows: </p>



<p>“I have been craving a trip to Florence since I watched the 1985 A Room with A View #dreamcometrue #florence #duomo #virginvoyages #honeymoon #needtogoback.”</p>

<p>“I feel like it’s nice to start over again in a new chapter,” Christine previously told E! News of her life with David. “We’re also starting over in a new chapter.”</p>
