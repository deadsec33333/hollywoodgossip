<p>Craig Conover opened up like never before on this week&#8217;s episode of Southern Charm.</p>



<p>During a candid conversation with very close pal Austen Kroll, this cast member delved into Austen&#8217;s previous claims that Craig had cleaned up his act <em>so</em> much while dating then-girlfriend Paige DeSorbo&#8230; that it caused a rift in their quality time together.</p>



<p>&#8220;Austen, listen, you&#8217;re one of my best friends,&#8221; Conover explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was never trying to do stuff to better myself to get away from other people. I didn&#8217;t ever know that it would change the level of our friendship. I want to get back to a place of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kroll took it from there.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m being honest, I feel like where all the disconnect has come is you&#8217;ve created this wonderful image of yourself and you&#8217;re terrified of disappointing someone or something,&#8221; he told Conover. </p>



<p>&#8220;Now, in order to maintain this, you&#8217;re saying, &#8216;I need to sit at my house and not see me with a beer in my hand,&#8217; or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Kroll told his friend to &#8220;loosen&#8221; up a bit, Craig at last told Kroll he&#8217;d quietly been struggling behind closed doors.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520925" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2174534299-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Craig Conover attends the Cracker Barrel Cheese 70th Anniversary Event on September 25, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Cracker Barrel Cheese)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t have any leash on myself,&#8221; Conover confessed. &#8220;That&#8217;s any addict. I was like, &#8216;F-ck, me trying not to be an alcoholic is now affecting my friendship with Austen.&#8217; And that&#8217;s where I was coming from. Like, I have tears in my eyes because it&#8217;s real.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was in the trenches by myself trying to better my life and then you were like, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re never with me anymore.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Dude, I can&#8217;t. I gotta stay home on my couch, because if I leave my couch, I&#8217;m gonna drink a bottle of JÃ¤ger and do dumb sh-t.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520926" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1401226016-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA: In this image released on June 5, Craig Conover attends the 2022 MTV Movie and TV Awards: UNSCRIPTED at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California and broadcast on June 5, 2022. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This conversation marked the first time Craig used the word &#8220;addict&#8221; with his friend.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really lucky, dude. I&#8217;m lucky I got out of it,&#8221; Conover said of his drinking and what could have transpired if he kept going down that dangerous path.</p>



<p>The honest exchange proved to be a breakthrough for the pair after their falling out&#8230; with Kroll saying he cautiously optimistic about the future of their relationship.</p>



<p>&#8220;Craig&#8217;s addiction doesn&#8217;t excuse him from being an a&#8211;hole, Craig&#8217;s addiction doesn&#8217;t excuse him from being an angry f&#8211;king person,&#8221; Austen said in a confessional.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it is the starting point and it definitely is not what I expected him to say. And I have to give him grace for being, finally, as open and vulnerable with me as he is right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover echoed this sentiment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Man, is it freeing to just be transparent,&#8221; he said in his own confessional. </p>



<p>&#8220;If we would have just had this conversation sooner, it would have saved us a lot of heartache and grief and frustration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Craig Conover and Salley Carson are getting closer.</p>



<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/paige-desorbo-craig-conover-shade-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">once-amicable split</a> between Craig and Paige DeSorbo, <em>Southern Charm</em> fans already wonder about the next <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/paige-desorbo-craig-conover-summer-house/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">messy pairing</a>.</p>



<p>Many believe that they&#8217;ve found it.</p>



<p>Will Salley Carson be the next to match up with Craig Conover?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-craig-conover-and-salley-carson-went-to-dinner-together">Craig Conover and Salley Carson went to dinner together</h2>



<p>In early February, <em>Southern Charm</em> stars Craig Conover and Salley Carson dined together in New York.</p>



<p>These two castmates were both in fairly recent breakups.</p>



<p>While even Bravo fans would hesitate to say that jumping into a new romance is the best follow-up to a split, some wondered if Craig and Salley are dating. After all, reality stardom and wise life choices seldom mix.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Craig Conover with a stank expression on his face on 'Summer House.'" class="wp-image-519158" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-1080x607.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_craigconover_01-Cropped.png 1625w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Seemingly out of his element, Craig Conover doesn&#8217;t seem to be a happy camper during portions of &#8216;Summer House&#8217; Season 9.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Previously, Salley Carson was dating certified hottie Andrew, while Craig Conover was in a serious relationship with Paige DeSorbo.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/craig-conover-denies-other-girls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This season of <em>Summer House</em></a> is showing the decline of Paige and Craig&#8217;s relationship, including a postmortem of sorts filmed earlier this year. (Their breakup was around Thanksgiving 2024)</p>



<p>Craig previously admitted to looking into dating, but feeling too raw after the split to follow through. Has that changed?</p>

<p>âWe went to dinner,&#8221; Salley Carson confirmed to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/would-salley-carson-date-southern-charm-costar-craig-conover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> regarding her meal with Craig Conover. &#8220;But there [were] also his two friends there, so it wasnât just the two of us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Salley did go so far as to describe Craig as being &#8220;hot as s&#8211;t.&#8221; That said, she&#8217;s unsure if he&#8217;s dating material, s she doesn&#8217;t âknow if our personalities would match well.â</p>



<p>With that out of the way, she clarified: âIâm just getting to know him in a friendship way.â</p>

<p>Additionally, Salley Carson sat down to discuss these romance rumors with <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StCDUXMr-gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decider</a></em>.</p>



<p>âThereâs no romance between me and Craig,&#8221; she emphasized. &#8220;Weâre just really good friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the wake of ex-boyfriend Andrew Dietz allegedly cheating on her, Salley made it sound as if she had no further interest in dating men in Charleston.</p>



<p>She even suggested that infidelity was the &#8220;norm.&#8221; Probably a little unfair to the city. But given some of what <em>Southern Charm</em> viewers have seen, perhaps a fair description of her on-screen social circle.</p>



<p>There are better men out there. We wish Salley the best of luck. That said, certain flavors of toxic boyfriends could <em>really </em>boost her reality TV career.</p>

<p>Craig Conover can explain, he <em>promises</em>.</p>



<p>In the space of a few weeks, Craig went from curiously <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/paige-desorbo-craig-conover-shade-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quiet about the breakup</a> to voicing some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/craig-conover-paige-desorbo-breakup-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bitter disagreements</a> with Paige DeSorbo&#8217;s statements.</p>



<p>Then came the <em>Summer House</em> premiere. </p>



<p>Now that all of Bravo has heard about him messaging other girls while he was with Paige, Craig has something to say.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-craig-conover-is-struggling-to-date-again-after-paige-desorbo">Craig Conover is struggling to date again after Paige DeSorbo</h2>



<p>As you can see in the video below, Craig Conover was a guest on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqpH-f7L89k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tamron Hall Show</a></em> on Monday, February 17.</p>



<p>Among other things, he delved into his thoughts on dating again. Paige DeSorbo dumped the <em>Southern Charm</em> star only months ago.</p>



<p>âIâm trying to move forward, so I downloaded a dating app,&#8221; Craig revealed. Then he confessed: &#8220;And it wasnât what I &#8212; I didnât feel as good as I thought it would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>âIâm still healing on myself, because I really did think I was gonna spend my life with Paige, and itâs OK, but I donât think rushing into something,â</p>



<p>âI just think for me, I think itâs about going back to my routine and living my life, and if I meet someone through that, then just go with it, but Iâm not gonna overthink it,â</p>



<p>âI think you shouldÂ be together for a year-and-a-half to two years before you get engaged. Thatâs just me,â âwonât date someoneâ unless he can see himself âmarrying them.â</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-craig-conover-has-gained-perspective-over-getting-dumped">Craig Conover has gained &#8216;perspective&#8217; over getting dumped</h2>



<p>âAt the end of the day, we accomplished so much in three years,&#8221; Craig reflected. &#8220;Like, weâre both in different places, and sheâs got so much to look forward to in her career.&#8221;</p>



<p>He shared: &#8220;And I wouldâve ended up losing myself, because I wouldâve given up everything to stay with her. And so the blessing is, as weâre a couple months out, I see that now.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, Craig saw &#8212; or at least heard about &#8212; Paige on <em>Summer House</em> implying that he texted other women before their relationship came to a close.</p>

<p>âIt was disappointing to see the direction that her and the show went,&#8221; Craig expressed.</p>



<p>He clarified that there was &#8220;not infidelity&#8221; on his part &#8212; and, finally, confirmed that Paige had not cheated on him. (There was a baseless rumor about her, one that he refused to address for weeks)</p>



<p>âShe got a lot of backlash for the breakup, which I was disappointed at,â Craig admitted. âAt the end of the day, she fell out of love. I wasnât the right person for her and I think thatâs OK.â</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-all-very-recent">This is all very recent</h2>



<p>This past month has felt like an eternity given the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible news</a> every few minutes, but Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo&#8217;s breakup is still very fresh.</p>



<p>Paige announced the news at the tail end of December 2024. She says that their breakup happened around Thanksgiving weekend.</p>



<p>Folks, Thanksgiving was pretty recent. Some of you probably have Thanksgiving leftovers hiding in a corner of your fridge. We should keep these raw emotions in mind when we consider Craig and Paige&#8217;s various comments.</p>

<p>Paige DeSorbo is <em>done </em>with Craig Conover.</p>



<p>That isn&#8217;t new. She announced <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/paige-desorbo-joe-damelio-mystery-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the breakup</a> in the final days of 2024. Since then, both Paige and also Craig have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/paige-desorbo-craig-conover-shade-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken out</a> about the split.</p>



<p>Now, <em>Summer House</em> Season 9 has begun. Obviously, as with all reality television, this filmed months ago. Seasons ago, in this case.</p>



<p>Season 9 promises to show the unraveling of this romance. Including Paige claiming that she caught Craig being in some way unfaithful.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paige-desorbo-and-craig-conover-s-breakup-will-be-televised">Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover&#8217;s breakup WILL be televised</h2>



<p>On Wednesday, February 12, Bravo aired the <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/summer-house/season-9/episode-1/uncharted-territory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Summer House</em> Season 9 premiere</a>. </p>



<p>At the time of the premiere, Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover were still an item. Paige even told friends about her family trip to Italy &#8212; one on which Craig had joined her.</p>



<p>But the supertease for the season showed the inevitable breakdown of their relationship, including a moment with a tearful Paige predicting a breakup. But that was not all.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-1024x576.png" alt="A tearful Paige DeSorbo in bed on Summer House Season 9." class="wp-image-519156" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_06.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">During the &#8216;Summer House&#8217; Season 9 supertease, Paige DeSorbo tearfully predicts the end of her relationship.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Six months after <em>Summer House</em> initially wrapped filming for Season 9, Paige sat down to talk with Amanda Batula and Lindsay Hubbard.</p>



<p>This bonus scene &#8212; which must have been filmed in the past month or so &#8212; shows her discussing her split from Craig Conover.</p>



<p>Make no mistake: we&#8217;ve seen Craig in the Season 9 superteaser. But this is different. This isn&#8217;t a fight at dinner, but a postmortem on their failed romance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-paige-desorbo-saying-about-craig-conover">What is Paige DeSorbo saying about Craig Conover?</h2>



<p>âIâm like, âCraig, what are you talking about? Like, I feel like youâre so betraying me right now,&#8217;â Paige recalled to her co-stars.</p>



<p>Whenever this scene filmed, it was clearly in 2025 &#8212; in the weeks following her social media announcement that the two had broken up.</p>



<p>âYouâre gonna let people say that Iâm a cheater?&#8221; Paige expressed in dismay. Though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/craig-conover-paige-desorbo-breakup-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Craig Conover has insisted</a> that he shouldn&#8217;t have to say anything to defend her, it is clear that these rumors &#8212; and his silence &#8212; have troubled her.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-1024x576.png" alt="Paige DeSorbo makes an expressive facial expression on 'Summer House' Season 9." class="wp-image-519159" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_paigedesorbo_05-Cropped.png 1607w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On &#8216;Summer House&#8217; Season 9, Paige DeSorbo makes quite the face at her then-boyfriend.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I caught you texting two b-tches in the course of our relationship,â Paige then announced dramatically.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Paige has stated that there was no physical or emotional cheating in her erstwhile relationship. But it seems that she is also alleging that Craig was attempting to change that &#8212; at least twice.</p>



<p>âNow, youâre dead to me,â Paige proclaimed. Ouch!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-a-mess">What a mess!</h2>



<p>At first, it had really sounded like Paige and Craig had broken up very amicably. Despite Craig&#8217;s stony silence, it seemed like they&#8217;d split like grownups.</p>



<p>But they are both reality TV stars. We should have known better. (And, one might argue, sometimes even the most mature exes have valid things to say about each other)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s likely that we won&#8217;t get to the meaty stuff about Paige and Craig until late in <em>Summer House</em> Season 9. But new hints of their uncoupling are clearly going to continue dropping as the season continues.</p>

<p>Craig Conover isn&#8217;t cosigning Paige DeSorbo or her version of their breakup.</p>



<p>For over a month, <em>Southern Charm</em> fans have speculated about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/paige-desorbo-joe-damelio-mystery-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Craig and Paige&#8217;s split</a>.</p>



<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/paige-desorbo-craig-conover-shade-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paige has shaded Craig</a> for not speaking up to defend her against cheating speculation.</p>



<p>The way that he sees it, he does not want to be involved. Craig says that this<em> wasn&#8217;t</em> a mutual split, and he&#8217;s eager to move on.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-craig-conover-is-speaking-out-about-his-split-from-paige-desorbo">Craig Conover is speaking out about his split from Paige DeSorbo</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, February 6 episode of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccZwnKOIKYE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch What Happens Live</a></em>, Craig Conover appeared as a guest. </p>



<p>Andy Cohen naturally asked him whether he &#8220;cosigned&#8221; Paige&#8217;s characterization of the split &#8212; namely, that there was no cheating of any kind.</p>



<p>âI donât want to be involved,â he said, his face looking grim. âI got broken up with. Iâm the ex-boyfriend, moving on with my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Craig Conover continued: &#8220;Iâm not going to get sucked into the mud with them.&#8221; Notably, he said <em>them</em>, not <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>Craig insisted: &#8220;Like, I never said you cheated, so Iâm not a part of this.â</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-craig-conover-seems-to-resent-that-paige-desorbo-wants-him-to-defend-her">Craig Conover seems to resent that Paige DeSorbo wants him to defend her</h2>



<p>No one thought that Craig Conover had accused Paige DeSorbo of cheating. But when <em>Southern Charm</em> fans fabricated the rumor to try to explain the split, he said &#8230; nothing. For over a month.</p>



<p>âI didnât tell her what to say [about their breakup on her podcast, âGiggly Squad.â],&#8221; he said defensively.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got a text and she said, âIâm announcing it on my podcast,'&#8221; Craig confirmed. &#8220;And then she said it was mutual, which it wasnât, I didnât know about it, she called me and told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>âItâs been a whirlwind, but Iâve been sitting in it, listening to people be like, âLove isnât enough,'&#8221; Craig Conover complained. &#8220;Guess what? Love is enough and I hate that Iâm being drawn into that.&#8221;</p>



<p>He continued: &#8220;If two people love each other, youâll make it work. For all the long-distance people watching â¦ like, we didnât want different things. She just wanted other people and thatâs fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Craig claimed: &#8220;She didnât want those things with me anymore. And Iâm not mad at her for that. But I donât like this âlove isnât enoughâ thing because youâll make it work.â</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-just-wanted-other-people-and-that-s-fine">&#8216;She just wanted other people and that&#8217;s fine&#8217;</h2>



<p>Obviously, none of us know exactly what went down. Paige initially made it sound like a very mutual breakup. One with no hard feelings. Craig is making it sound like something that took him by surprise.</p>



<p>It is customary for amicable breakups (and even some of the less happy ones) for one or both public figures to defend the other as needed. We have all seen countless posts of a weary ex clarifying that no one cheated. Sometimes, even with a broken heart, people speak up for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/craig-conover-and-paige-desorbo-totally-love-each-other-why-arent-they-engaged-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone they once loved</a>.</p>



<p>The fact that Craig Conover seems unwilling to do this for Paige DeSorbo speaks volumes about where things currently stand.</p>

<p>Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/paige-desorbo-joe-damelio-mystery-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke up</a> late last year.</p>



<p>While it wasn&#8217;t your typical <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/southern-charm-shocker-who-just-announced-his-exit-ahead-of-season-10/"><em>Southern Charm</em> shocker</a>, Paige and Craig&#8217;s split took many fans by surprise.</p>



<p>According to Paige, there&#8217;s a reason for that.</p>



<p>While debunking breakup theories and seemingly shading her ex, she&#8217;s laying out the real timeline of her conscious uncoupling from Craig.</p>

<p></p>



<p>On January 22, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sassyaaf/p/DFIlx1Zytad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme account</a> posted a tongue-in-cheek celebration of singledom.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so bummed to be single,&#8221; the post began sarcastically. &#8220;How will I ever find another guy who brings absolutely nothing to the table.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now, Paige DeSorbo does not run the account, which seems to primarily repurpose decade-old social media posts without attribution. But she certainly hit <em>like </em>on that particular post, and Bravo fans took notice.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ouch!!!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/southerncharm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#southerncharm</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/summerhouse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#summerhouse</a> <a href="https://t.co/jLzhtMi6gB">pic.twitter.com/jLzhtMi6gB</a></p>&mdash; BravoSnarkSide (@SnarkBravo) <a href="https://twitter.com/SnarkBravo/status/1886486546406338818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>However, across social media, <em>Southern Charm</em> fans seemed divided over whether Paige DeSorbo was shading Craig Conover or simply enjoying a post.</p>



<p>Some insisted that she was straight-up calling out Craig as having brought &#8220;nothing&#8221; to their erstwhile romance.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, others pointed out that people &#8220;like&#8221; things on meme accounts all of the time. Unless someone&#8217;s spam-liking something awful or specific &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t have to be about Paige&#8217;s most recent ex.</p>

<p>It is only natural for the general public to speculate when a reality TV couple seems to abruptly split without explanation. When Paige announced the breakup on December 30 of 2024, it came as a shock.</p>



<p>But on the Monday, February 3 episode of Paige&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GigglySquad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Giggly Squad</em> podcast</a>, she clarified that she did not cheat on Craig. Not physically or even emotionally.</p>



<p>Paige also expressed her frustration that she&#8217;s having to address the rumors. Craig, she says, should be quashing these claims.</p>

<p>Additionally, Paige laid out the details of her breakup with Craig.</p>



<p>The former couple split up over Thanksgiving weekend of last year. However, they did not initially go public. Craig even allowed people to believe that they were still a couple while he promoted Southern Charm, and Paige says that she was fine with that.</p>



<p>However, Paige shared the breakup news on December 30. The reason, she explained, was that Craig had begun &#8220;presenting himself as single.&#8221; At that point, she reasoned, it was time to go public &#8212; but she sent her ex a text in advance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-she-have-a-new-boyfriend">Does she have a new boyfriend?</h2>



<p>There have been rumors &#8212; without confirmation &#8212; that Paige is dating someone new after Craig.</p>



<p>However, during her podcast episode, Paige confirmed that she is currently single.</p>



<p>Good for her. Even a regular breakup can be difficult. Splitting after a long-term, long-distance romance that aired on reality television? Paige deserves time for herself. So does Craig, for that matter.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/southern-charm-season-9-meet-the-cast-get-totally-spoiled/"><em>Southern Charm</em> Season 9</a> is here. And the cast is dealing with, just, <em>so </em>much baggage.</p>



<p>One of the central issues is Shep Rose and Taylor Ann Green&#8217;s breakup. That split had a butterfly effect. And there are lingering, unresolved hurts.</p>



<p>At Madison Lecroy&#8217;s wedding afterparty (she&#8217;s married, remember?), Taylor confronted Craig Conover. Basically, she felt like Craig treated Shep&#8217;s cheating like a joke. That he treated <em>her </em>like a joke.</p>



<p>The result was that Craig ended up more or less screaming at Taylor. He thinks that she&#8217;s angry at the wrong person. Is she?</p>

<p>Obviously, so much went down on the <em>Southern Charm</em> Season 9 premiere.</p>



<p>And that was before they even arrived at Madison Lecroy&#8217;s friend&#8217;s home. Brittany opened the doors of her sprawling home to guests <em>and </em>to production, to film Madison&#8217;s wedding afterparty.</p>



<p>And then plenty happened at the party itself before Taylor and Craig faced off.</p>

<p>But the true meat of the premiere was when Taylor, after speaking to Shep Rose (awkwardly) and getting support from Austen Kroll, spoke to Craig.</p>



<p>âI will say, from my perspective, the way that you approached our breakup was really shitty,â she told Craig.</p>



<p>Shep had been trying to get Craig and Austen to leave with him to avoid just such a confrontation.</p>

<p>âWe used to be friends,&#8221; Taylor told him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I havenât heard from you,&#8221; she said. Others, in contrast, had reached out.</p>

<p>Last year, we heard all about Taylor and Shep&#8217;s breakup.</p>



<p>She accused him of cheating on her with a string of different women.</p>



<p>Shep objected to that characterization. He wasn&#8217;t saying that he didn&#8217;t cheat. Just, in his mind, he didn&#8217;t <em>mean </em>to &#8212; he wasn&#8217;t calling women to come over when she wasn&#8217;t there. </p>

<p>That is a distinction â¦ but doesn&#8217;t change what he did to her.</p>



<p>Anyway, Taylor noted that she had received support from surprising sources. She&#8217;s never been besties with Madison, but Madison messaged her after the split.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Craig didn&#8217;t even check in. That hurt.</p>

<p>Craig didn&#8217;t feel like this was a fair characterization. He also denied laughing over the cheating (though perhaps he <em>did </em>laugh at Shep in some capacity).</p>



<p>Instead, he claimed that he actually &#8220;stopped&#8221; Shep from kissing another woman.</p>



<p>According to him, he sat Shep down in an effort to get the guy to snap out of it. (Shep, it seems, does not remember some of his cheating &#8230; which is a whole other problem)</p>

<p>But Craig apparently saw this as some sort of <em>bro code </em>issue.</p>



<p>In his mind, Taylor was his &#8220;friends&#8217; girlfriend&#8221; and so he couldn&#8217;t &#8220;go behind his back&#8221; and rat him out to Taylor.</p>



<p>âThe girls have had my back â¦ the only guy whoâs had my back is Austen,â Taylor noted.</p>

<p>Basically, Craig felt like his closer friendship with Shep and some sort of weird gender divide meant hat he couldn&#8217;t be a better friend to Taylor.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Taylor clearly feels like she was essentially a joke. She feels like a fool because of Shep&#8217;s cheating, and worries that other people in the group see her the same way.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a complex, painful situation. And it didn&#8217;t need to happen.</p>

<p>âYou werenât there the night he did it,&#8221; Craig said growing defensive.</p>



<p>&#8220;I threw him through a f&#8211;king wall,â he then yelled. Madison&#8217;s party didn&#8217;t really need this intense discussion.</p>

<p>Then, Taylor took this to a weird place.</p>



<p>âWhat about your girl cheating on you?â she asked as he walked off. Does she mean Paige DeSorbo?</p>



<p>Ignoring her, Craig fired back: âYouâre embarrassing yourself.â He&#8217;s certainly right about that.</p>

<p>Obviously, Taylor is in a lot of pain. She did embarrass herself, and it wasn&#8217;t all about Shep or Craig, either.</p>



<p>Just a little etiquette reminder: check with someone before you gift them a vibrator. Especially at a public party. Even if you&#8217;re not on camera.</p>



<p>They can be wonderful gifts! But literally just check first. Maybe have a public gift and a private gift if that&#8217;s what they need. Come on, girl. Get it together.</p>

<p>As <em>Southern Charm</em> viewers have seen, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/craig-conover-cant-handle-naomie-olindo-boning-whitney-sudler-smith/">Craig Conover sometimes struggles</a> exes living their lives.</p>



<p>During a relationship, however, things are different.</p>



<p>Craig is clearly head over heels for Paige DeSorbo. In fact, this item is so close that wedding bells could chime at any moment.</p>



<p>So &#8230; why haven&#8217;t they? They&#8217;re not even engaged yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo sure make a cute couple, don&#8217;t they? (Photo Credit: Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Southern Charm</em> star Craig Conover and <em>Summer House</em> star Paige Desorbo have managed to ward off breakup rumors from all sides.</p>



<p>Sometimes, these kinds of rumors herald an imminent split on the horizon. Not in this case. By all accounts, these two are fully committed.</p>



<p>But there are some real hints that one of them is a little more committed than the other. And, progressively, they seem to be smashing some gender role stereotypes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Southern Charm Craig Conover On Paige DeSorbo Proposal &amp; When He May Do It" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3yWj4GsHsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>According to Craig, he would love nothing more than to marry Paige. Or even just to propose.</p>



<p>But he has stated &#8212; more than once &#8212; that he will pop the question to his lady love &#8220;as soon as she&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</p>



<p>Which seems to indicate that <em>Paige </em>is the one who&#8217;s not so eager to move things along in their relationship. What&#8217;s up?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Charm star Craig Conover is a former college playboy who &#8230; is still a playboy. But hey, now he&#8217;s passed the bar exam AND has developed an interest in sewing. So the world is essentially his oyster.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thinking back, we have witnessed the epic highs and lows of Craig&#8217;s on-screen romances in the past.</p>



<p>Things did not work out, but we saw his love life with the beautiful Naomie Olindo on <em>Southern Charm</em>.</p>



<p>As we have previously reported, they struggled to find the right balance when it came to being both friends and exes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Craig Conover and Naomie Olindo &#8211; Craig Conover Instagram &#8211; https://www.instagram.com/p/BRZBtzfg293/</figcaption></figure>



<p>And viewers have also seen Paige&#8217;s love life.</p>



<p>While filming <em>Summer House</em> in 2020, she broke up with longtime boyfriend Perry Rahbar.</p>



<p>Then, in April 2021, she and Craig first became &#8220;linked&#8221; in the public eye &#8230; though they did not announce anything in an official capacity. Not yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Southern Charm star Craig Conover shows that never growing up has never looked so good as he enjoys his life of luxury.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That changed in October of 2021, when Craig and Paige went public as a couple. Since then, however, the two have been extremely public, going <em>everywhere </em>together.</p>



<p>We have seen them together on <em>Southern Charm</em>. And on <em>Summer House</em>. We have also seen them on <em>Winter House</em>. One couple on three shows &#8212; that&#8217;s a Bravolebrity power couple.</p>



<p>Craig has affirmed that &#8220;we love each other, and we want to spend our lives together.&#8221; So &#8230; they clearly know what they want.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>We do not know what lies ahead for Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo. They are both on reality TV, which comes with its own ups and downs.</p>



<p>Some reality couples have shared how watching their lives play out on screen helped their marriages. Sometimes, you only really &#8220;see&#8221; yourself when it&#8217;s through someone else&#8217;s eyes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there is the infamous &#8220;reality curse&#8221; for on-screen couples. Craig and Paige may want to watch their step.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Remember when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/craig-conover-sets-new-boundaries-with-naomie-olindo-for-girlfriends-sake/">Craig Conover set &#8220;boundaries&#8221; with Naomie Olindo</a> a couple of weeks ago?</p>



<p>Some exes struggle more to remain normal friends than others. These two fall on the <em>more </em>side.</p>



<p>On this week&#8217;s episode, the aftermath of the dog wedding revealed Naomie&#8217;s hookup &#8230; with Whitney Sudler-Smith.</p>



<p>Craig was so weirded out by it, on multiple levels. Is he overstepping?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Craig Conover and Naomie Olindo &#8211; Craig Conover Instagram &#8211; https://www.instagram.com/p/BRZBtzfg293/</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Why did everybody get so drunk at a dog wedding?&#8221; Naomie asked her friend, Leva Bonaparte.</p>



<p>Little Craig and Peaches may have been the star attractions of the get-together, but they did not party the hardest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of the dog wedding,&#8221; Naomie confided, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you, but right after, I did kiss Whitney.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Whitney Sudler-Smith poses in a blue jacked and sunglasses in this photo shared to Instagram.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It sounds like things went a little beyond kissing, in fact.</p>



<p>âIt was fun,&#8221; Naomie described.</p>



<p>She then revealed: &#8220;He spent the night here.â</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Looks aren&#8217;t everything, but in a visual medium like reality TV, they count for a lot. We look forward to seeing how Leva gets along with the rest of the cast. And Naomie referred to there being &#8220;a couple of new girls,&#8221; so it doesn&#8217;t sound like Leva is alone.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leva was surprised, to say the least.</p>



<p>âYou were, like, spooning with Whitney and you didnât f&#8211;king tell me?â she asked.</p>



<p>Many of us are (lovingly) nosy about the lives of our besties. And Leva was not alone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>âWait a minute. Wait a minute,&#8221; Austen Kroll chimed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is juicy,&#8221; he described. &#8220;I love this.â</p>



<p>He was also quick to shade Whitney in Yemassee, describing the Frank Lloyd Wright house as &#8220;perfectly set up for Whitney&#8217;s aesthetic.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>What aesthetic is that? According to Austen, a &#8220;Seventies porno house.&#8221; <em>Shade</em>.</p>



<p>He noted to the cameras that it was obvious that Naomie and Whitney had hooked up.</p>



<p>However, he emphasized that he didn&#8217;t want to spill the beans to everyone. Well, not yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Austen Kroll is originally from Charlotte, North Carolina. He is charismatic and a loyal friend, but he&#8217;s known to get stuck in a love triangle or two.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Iâm trying so hard not to look at Leva,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A secret like this [will come out in] 24 hours.&#8221;</p>



<p>Austen characterized: &#8220;Thatâs the grace period.&#8221;</p>



<p>He then confessed: &#8220;I already told Shep [Rose] and Taylor [Ann Green].â Of course.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Olivia Flowers looks gorgeous in bubblegum pink in this photo that she shared via Instagram.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Shep and Taylor ended up being the ones to tell Olivia Flowers when it came up.</p>



<p>See, they had all noticed how Whitney had played favorites when assigning them to their rooms.</p>



<p>Naomie got an especially good room. People noticed. And then Venita Aspen knew.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Addressing the camera, Venita expressed her dismay over Naomie&#8217;s apparent taste in men.</p>



<p>âNaomie, you are creme de la creme. Why are you hooking up with Whitney?â she asked. âIs this a joke?â</p>



<p>Many of us have watched with confusion as beautiful friends make inexplicable choices. It happens.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/southern-charm-reunion-reactions.gif" alt="Southern Charm Reunion Reactions" class="wp-image-304936"/><figcaption>Southern Charm stars Kathryn Dennis, Austen Kroll, Naomie Olindo, and Cameran Eubanks all react with visible horror and discomfort.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eventually, of course, Craig Conover had his turn to learn.</p>



<p>Remember, he dated Naomie for three years. They split in 2017 &#8230; but hooked up a couple of times, much more recently.</p>



<p>We can understand that Craig had complicated feelings about the news.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Craig Conover shows that never growing up has never looked so good as he enjoys his life of luxury.</figcaption></figure>



<p>âThat stinks. [To] go from me to Whitney,â Craig remarked. &#8220;It&#8217;s just not that fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though it&#8217;s not like Naomie jumped from one bed to the other, it can be awkward.</p>



<p>And Craig&#8217;s continuing efforts to balance boundaries and his current relationship likely add to the complications.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Craig Conover is a former college playboy who &#8230; is still a playboy. But hey, now he&#8217;s passed the bar exam AND has developed an interest in sewing. So the world is essentially his oyster.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry. This isn&#8217;t a case of Craig trying to control his ex.</p>



<p>&#8220;Naomie can do whatever she wants, but I think it&#8217;s shady of Whitney,&#8221; he expressed to the confessional camera.</p>



<p>&#8220;The bro-code rules are complicated at times, I understand that, but it&#8217;s still my ex-girlfriend,&#8221; Craig lamented. &#8220;Like, what the f&#8211;k?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Whitney Sudler-Smith was the filmmaker whose idea it was to create Southern Charm in the first place.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Later, Whitney told Craig point-blank that it wasn&#8217;t a random hookup.</p>



<p>He also told him that it was none of his business.</p>



<p>This of course led to Craig later saying &#8220;f&#8211;k you Whitney&#8221; and storming off.</p>

<p>Even off screen, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/shep-rose-gets-flirty-with-taylor-ann-green-after-breakup/">the <em>Southern Charm</em> drama</a> never stops.</p>



<p>On this week&#8217;s episode, both Austen Kroll and Craig Conover were feeling the intersection of current and former romances.</p>



<p>First, Craig set new &#8220;boundaries&#8221; in his friendship with beautiful Naomie.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Austen isn&#8217;t sure that he has a future with Olivia if she&#8217;s going to be so friendly with Madison LeCroy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Craig Conover and Naomie Olindo &#8211; Craig Conover Instagram &#8211; https://www.instagram.com/p/BRZBtzfg293/</figcaption></figure>



<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of <em>Southern Charm</em>, viewers got a walk down memory lane of Craig Conover and Naomie Olindo&#8217;s history.</p>



<p>The two dated for three years before their 2017 breakup.</p>



<p>More recently, the two <em>bumped lovelies</em> in Vegas. These days, they&#8217;re working on just being friends.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Craig is with Paige DeSorbo.</p>



<p>We can all understand why, given their history, Paige is uncomfortable with Craig hanging out one-on-one with Naomie.</p>



<p>But this week, Craig and Naomie did meet up to talk about Naomie&#8217;s awkward chat with Chleb.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Chleb had discussed Kathryn Dennis at length. And not in a flattering way.</p>



<p>âOne of the lessons that I learned after everything happened with me and you,&#8221; Naomie began.</p>



<p>She stressed: &#8220;is never air your dirty laundry with other people.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Hearing Chleb dragging Kathryn&#8217;s name through the mud really put her own past in perspective.</p>



<p>Naomie had already apologized for speaking ill of Craig.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have so many regrets about that,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Craig was not entirely receptive to what Naomie had to say. It was weird.</p>



<p>âCraig is making me really uncomfortable. Heâs, like, jittery,â Naomie told the confessional camera. </p>



<p>âNot making eye contact,&#8221; she observed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Craig Conover shows that never growing up has never looked so good as he enjoys his life of luxury.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Naomie jokingly characterized: &#8220;Heâs literally acting like Iâm part of a sting operation.â</p>



<p>Apparently, Craig felt annoyed that she&#8217;d called him to meet in person. He was very <em>this could have been an email</em> about it.</p>



<p>âWhy did we have to have coffee to tell me Chleb is talking s&#8211;t about Kathryn?â Craig complained to the camera.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Craig Conover is a former college playboy who &#8230; is still a playboy. But hey, now he&#8217;s passed the bar exam AND has developed an interest in sewing. So the world is essentially his oyster.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The obvious answer is <em>because this is a reality show</em>, my dude.</p>



<p>But of course, Naomie seems to just be having an easier time being friends than Craig is.</p>



<p>So Craig told Naomie that he wanted to set some &#8220;boundaries&#8221; in their friendship. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>âI think that Paige is being very understanding,&#8221; Craig told the camera</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though she doesnât understand it,&#8221; he added, &#8220;because she lives in New York where you donât run into your exes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Craig added: âShe has been patient with me hooking up with Naomie while me and Paige were figuring stuff out.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Southern Charm star Naomie Olindo is known for a number of things, but many fans agree that she&#8217;s the most beautiful member of the cast.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I donât want to push it by disrespecting her any further,&#8221; Craig emphasized.</p>



<p>In other words, he put his own relationship on thin ice, and is making it Naomie&#8217;s problem.</p>



<p>Naomie felt surprised and weirded out by Craig, but she didn&#8217;t try to dispute his new boundary.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Southern Charm stars Naomie Olindo, Danni Baird, and Eliza Limehouse went horseback riding together.</figcaption></figure>



<p>âIâm not trying to get with Craig if he has a girlfriend. Thatâs just not how I am,â Naomie told the camera. </p>



<p>âIf Craig and Paige feel awkward,&#8221; she reasoned, &#8220;thatâs on them, not me.â</p>



<p>Just for the record &#8230; plenty of people are friends with their exes. Yes, <em>even </em>in New York.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/southern-charm-reunion-reactions.gif" alt="Southern Charm Reunion Reactions" class="wp-image-304936"/><figcaption>Southern Charm stars Kathryn Dennis, Austen Kroll, Naomie Olindo, and Cameran Eubanks all react with visible horror and discomfort.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Austen Kroll also found himself in an uncomfortable spot involving a girlfriend and an ex.</p>



<p>His own girlfriend, Olivia, invited Madison LeCroy to her get-together.</p>



<p>Austen admitted: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t spoken to her since the party.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>âI donât want to pursue someone that wants to be friends with my ex,&#8221; Austen expressed.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this, Kathryn then quipped to the cameras: âSometimes Austen can be a petty bitch.â</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t always agree with Kathryn Dennis. But she&#8217;s not wrong here.</p>
