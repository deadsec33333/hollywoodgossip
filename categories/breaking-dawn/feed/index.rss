<p>But less than two years later, it already feels like ancient history.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is that Blake and Miranda both moved on with surprising speed.</p>

<p>Blake, obviously started<a href="/2015/11/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-yup-were-dating/"> dating Gwen Stefani</a> before the ink was dry on his divorce papers.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<a href="/2015/12/anderson-east-totally-dating-miranda-lambert-stepdad-confirms/">Miranda got involved with Anderson East</a> just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while Blake and Gwen appear to be headed for the altar, Miranda&#8217;s rebound romance has gone quite as smoothly.</p>
<p>After weeks of rumors that they&#8217;re on the outs, Miranderson&nbsp;appears to have declared an official cooling off period.</p>
<p>Yes, they&#8217;re technically not broken up; they&#8217;re just &quot;on a break.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="657" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-657x1024.jpg" alt="Anderson East and Miranda Lambert Pic" class="wp-image-246130" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-657x1024.jpg 657w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-192x300.jpg 192w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-768x1198.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-985x1536.jpg 985w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-1313x2048.jpg 1313w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-735x1146.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-215x335.jpg 215w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-223x347.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-333x520.jpg 333w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-410x640.jpg 410w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-492x768.jpg 492w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-616x960.jpg 616w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-693x1080.jpg 693w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/anderson-east-and-miranda-lambert-pic-scaled.jpg 1642w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But you know how those situations tend to play out &#8230;</p>
<p>The story comes to us from <em>OK!</em> magazine via an <em>In Touch</em> exclusive, and the tabloid claims that the break was Anderson&#8217;s idea.</p>
<p>Apparently, he&#8217;s been feeling pressure to propose to Miranda, but he simply doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the right time to put a ring on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told her he wants to take a break,&rdquo; <a href="http://okmagazine.com/photos/miranda-lambert-boyfriend-anderson-east-break-up/">a source</a> tells <em>In Touch.</em></p>
<p>The insider adds that Miranda is holding out hope &#8230; but she also has her doubts:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;She really felt they were meant to be together. And they still may be &mdash; Anderson is only cooling things off,&rdquo; the tipster says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t take away the sting for Miranda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The source adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really loves Anderson and thought they were doing so well&hellip;She believed she and Anderson connected on so many levels,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazingly, this could be the rare case in which a couple takes a Ross-and-Rachel-esque break, but then actually works their issues out and gets back together.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It seems Anderson really does think Miranda is the one &#8230; but he&#8217;s just not ready to take the leap yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew it was going to hurt her but he also knows they&rsquo;re both just not ready for this,&rdquo; says the source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not counting out them getting back together or even marrying someday. He just couldn&rsquo;t see them marrying now.&quot;</p>
<p>But apparently all Anderson&#8217;s promises aren&#8217;t doing much to soften the blow for Miranda:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miranda still feels like she&rsquo;s been dumped by someone she loves so much,&quot; says the insider.</p>

<p>The awards, given out the night before the <a href="/2013/01/academy-awards-2013-nominations-revealed/">2013 Academy Awards</a>, celebrate (or call out) Hollywood&#8217;s worst achievements of the cinematic year.</p>

<p>Breaking Dawn Part 2 was recognized in seven categories, including worst picture. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew on that dubious honor!!</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="467" height="336" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/promo-photo-for-national-lampoons-vacation-reboot.jpg" alt="Promo Photo For National Lampoon's Vacation Reboot" class="wp-image-70321" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/promo-photo-for-national-lampoons-vacation-reboot.jpg 467w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/promo-photo-for-national-lampoons-vacation-reboot-300x216.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/promo-photo-for-national-lampoons-vacation-reboot-335x241.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/04/promo-photo-for-national-lampoons-vacation-reboot-347x250.jpg 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></figure>
          
<p>Other Razzies racked up by the final Twilight Saga film:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>
		Worst sequel</li>
	<li>
		Bill Condon, worst director</li>
	<li>
		<a href="/stars/kristen-stewart/">Kristen Stewart</a>, worst actress</li>
	<li>
		<a href="/stars/taylor-lautner/">Taylor Lautner</a>, worst supporting actor</li>
	<li>
		Lautner and Mackenzie Foy, worst couple</li>
	<li>
		The entire cast, worst screen ensemble</li>
</ul>
<p>The film, of course, made $828 million at the box office and its big three stars are now world famous, so the Razzies can sort of suck it in that sense.</p>
<p>Adam Sandler, who last year monopolized the Razzies with his &#8220;comedy&#8221;<em> Jack &amp; Jill</em>, this year got only two awards for <em>That&#8217;s My Boy</em>. Progress, man!</p>
<p>Rihanna, as worst supporting actress in <em>Battleship</em>, won by a landslide, while worst screenwriter Sandler beat the authors of <em>Breaking Dawn </em><a href="http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/package/article/0,,20658247_20676633,00.html">by a single vote</a>.</p>
<p>Nothing like a true awards season nail-biter.</p>

<p>Lammers, whose own <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/16/3921057/cops-man-plotted-attack-during.html">mother turned him in</a> Thursday after becoming suspicious of his intentions, faces three felony charges in the alleged plot.</p>
<p>He was charged Friday with first-degree assault, making a terroristic threat and armed criminal action. He is jailed in Polk County on $500,000 bond.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Bolivar, Mo., Police Chief Steve Hamilton said Lammers, 23, was unstable and committed for 96 hours for a mental health examination back in 2009.</p>
<p>In Missouri, hospitals and law enforcement officials can request a person be held against their will for up to 96 hours if he or she appears to be a threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like everything was done appropriately at that time,&#8221; Hamilton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average person will say &#8216;Why was he not charged criminally?&#8217; And the reality is the law only allows so much when a person is having mental issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investigation began Thursday, when Lammers&#8217; mother contacted authorities, saying she worried that her son &#8220;may have intentions of shooting people.&#8221;</p>
<p>His apparent target? A capacity movie theater crowd during the premiere of the final film in the popular vampire series, police wrote in the probable cause statement.</p>
<p>Blaec Lammers&#8217; mom said her son recently had purchased weapons &#8211; two assault rifles and hundreds of bullets &#8211; that were similar to those used by <a href="/stars/james-holmes/">James Holmes</a>.</p>
<p>Holmes is the troubled gunman who opened fire inside a theater in Aurora, Colo., during <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> movie in July. That attack killed 12 people.</p>
<p>Police wrote in the probable cause statement that Lammers was &#8220;off of his medication&#8221; and thankfully moved to arrest him before the unthinkable happened.</p>

<p>The final installment of The Twilight Saga grossed $30.4 million combined at Thursday night and midnight showings this morning. Impressive? Yes.</p>
<p>A record? Not quite.</p>

<p>Last year&#8217;s <em>Breaking Dawn Part 1</em> garnered a franchise-high $30.3 million solely from midnight screenings from around the nation, for example.</p>
<p>And <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em> took in $43.5 million from that same time slot alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Let&#8217;s be honest: it doesn&#8217;t matter what any critic says about Breaking Dawn Part 2. The movie will be a mammoth success.</p>
<p>But once you get past the <a href="/2012/11/dakota-fanning-on-kristen-stewart-scandal-dont-judge/">Kristen Stewart scandal</a> and stop analyzing every scene between her and <a href="/stars/robert-pattinson/">Robert Pattinson</a>, is the movie itself worth the price of admission?</p>
<p>Yes, this is a strong conclusion to The Twilight Saga.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with Stewart as Bella, a new vampire, bloodthirsty and ravenous. The actress excels in such a role, leaving behind the awkward glances and pauses that fans have come to know and sort of love from the first set of films.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s on the prowl here, and it&#8217;s a pleasure to watch.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>And that same, more aggressive tone permeates the entire movie. There&#8217;s more action in Breaking Dawn Part 2 &#8211; and a lot more sex.</p>
<p>By now, you&#8217;ve all seen the tantalizing <a href="/videos/breaking-dawn-part-2-clip-bedroom-action/">clip of Bella and Edward</a>. Their love is fully on display in the flick, though don&#8217;t get TOO excited: their clothes do stay on.</p>
<p>But this is a more mature movie overall, and a more mature version of a relationship we&#8217;ve seen go through multiple phases over the years. Bella and Edward are each members of the undead, on equal footing and, of course, parents to an endangered little girl.</p>
<p>Gone is the pining of an innocent human girl for a mysterious blood sucker, which ought to be a welcome development for all.</p>
<p>And it all culminates in an impressive action sequence when our heroes and heroines team up to take on the Volturi. Be warned, however, fans of the book: you&#8217;ll be in for a change. The much-publicized <a href="/2012/11/kristen-stewart-teases-twist-twilight-saga-ending-on-the-tonight/">twist of an ending</a> is real and likely to cause some strife among Twihards.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t say another word about it now. But we will encourage readers to buy a ticket, sit back and enjoy. This is a weird, fun, romantic ending to what has been a wild ride.</p>
