<p>You might wanna turn away right about now, Anthony Mackie and Harrison Ford.</p>



<p>Marvel has released the fourth installment in a previously-beloved franchise &#8212; but, thus far at least, critics don&#8217;t exactly seem smitten with Captain America: Brave New World.</p>



<p>It marks Mackie&#8217;s first time taking on the lead and it features Harrison in the role of the President <em>and</em> the Red Hulk.</p>



<p>So&#8230; why all the negative reviews? Why aren&#8217;t movie critics putting up their shields and defending the film? Scroll down to find out&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519369" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-960x540.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/download-2025-02-12T122445.484.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Anthony Mackie in Captain America: Brave New World.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As with other Captain America content, this film attempts a taut political thriller. It works for the most part, though there’s some clunky dialogue and it bends over backwards to avoid being too political</strong>. &#8212; Fat Guys at the Movies</p>



<p><strong>It represents the MCU on autopilot, and while that means everything runs smoothly, it never goes anywhere particularly interesting. </strong>&#8212; Tom&#8217;s Guide</p>



<p><strong>I can&#8217;t believe at one time I complained about these Marvel movies having too many superheroes per movie because Brave New World feels empty with only one, especially one that could more easily die in any fight he&#8217;s in.</strong> &#8212; MullingMovies.com</p>



<p><strong>Anthony Mackie fights hard with his vibranium wings, but the Marvel magic didn’t take flight for this one. Marvel and Disney are still looking for that Brave New World. Maybe in the next one, it will magically appear.</strong> &#8212; Movies and Shakers</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="674" height="307" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/hq720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519370" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/hq720.jpg 674w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/hq720-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Anthony Mackie does all he can to save Captain America 4.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>For his part, Mackie is charismatic and has star power, though he still feels somewhat timid in the role, and he lacks the character moments to truly shine.</strong> &#8212; Detroit News</p>



<p><strong>For the MCU to make it back to their previous standing atop the blockbuster landscape, they’re going to have to deliver much more interesting characters and stories than are present in Captain America: Brave New World. </strong>&#8212; Culture Map</p>



<p><strong>Compared to some of the studio&#8217;s recent misfires, this new entry is at least passable.</strong> &#8212; Newsday</p>



<p><strong>We get a movie that, much like the MCU itself these days, is merely running on autopilot. Captain America may still stand for something, but Brave New World sure doesn’t.</strong> &#8212; Cinemaholics</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="322" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/2667-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519371" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/2667-copy.jpg 537w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/2667-copy-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Harrison Ford as the Red Hulk.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Marvel Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Brave New World is as visually lifeless as the most lifeless MCU thrillers, marred by needless overcutting, flimsy digital backdrops and stilted composition; thematically, it says nothing confidently and even less coherently.</strong> &#8212; Paste Magazine</p>



<p><strong>It’s been a long time since a Marvel movie felt like a building block with its own structural integrity. Even for its flaws, Captain America: Brave New World feels like the series may be finding its soul again. </strong>&#8212; Austin Chronicle</p>



<p><strong>What distinguishes “Captain America: Brave New World,” blissfully under two hours, is that action is kept to a relative minimum, and the actors are actually allowed to find and deepen their cardboard characters, including Danny Ramirez as Falcon</strong>. &#8212; San Francisco Chronicle</p>



<p><strong>Brave New World is a bunch of characters wandering around in search of meaning, the Marvel machine creaking loudly as it tries to whip up some grand mythos around these B-tier figures</strong>. &#8212; Vanity Fair</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the moment all music theater majors have been waiting for:</p>



<p>The big screen adaptation of Wicked is now playing across the country.</p>



<p>Starring Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elpahaba, Wicked tells the story of the Witch of the West &#8212; before she became, well, wicked.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a prequel to the Wizard of Oz.</p>

<p><strong>How do I love the film of the hit stage musical, let me count the ways, starting with the way Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande set the screen ablaze as frenemy witches and sets, costumes and songs to die for. Seeing this joyous eruption once is not enough.</strong> &#8212; Peter Travers, ABC News</p>



<p><strong>This is a sumptuous and unsubtle treat grounded in Erivo’s graceful and subtle performance. When she defies gravity, she lifts us with her, and we lean forward to the next chapter.</strong> &#8212; Movie Mom</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Wicked&#8221; is the most entertaining film of the year and the most dazzling live-action Hollywood musical since “Chicago.” To put it in the kind of lingo used in Oz, I pronuncify it magnifical.</strong> &#8212; Wall Street Journal</p>



<p><strong><em>Cynthia Erivo&#8217;s impassioned performance is the most real thing in the artificial Oz of Jon M. Chu&#8217;s CGI-heavy &#8216;Wicked.&#8217;</em></strong> &#8212; Metro Weekly (Washington DC)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="425" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-1024x425.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513791" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-1024x425.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-300x125.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-768x319.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-2048x850.webp 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-960x399.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-1080x448.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/MCDWICK_UV071-1200x498.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Grande is simply a wonder in the film version of Wicked.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Universal Pictures)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There’s no denying that some people will be very, very happy with this. Others might find themselves wondering how something can be magical and meh at the same time.</strong> &#8212; The List</p>



<p><strong>Erivo and Grande deliver amazing performances in their respective roles as Elphaba and Galinda, capturing their characters&#8217; many facets and singing their hearts out. In terms of musical adaptations, Wicked exceeds all expectations</strong>. &#8212; 411 Mania</p>



<p><strong>Erivo brings a strong sense of dignity to Elphaba, while Grande proves she&#8217;s got comedic chops to go with those golden pipes. Jon M. Chu reaches new heights with this dazzling, vivid, and surprisingly heartfelt movie musical</strong>. &#8212; FlixChatter Film Blog</p>



<p><strong>Though the run time may seem excessive (two hours and 40 minutes?!), it is a testament to Chu and his team’s care that each musical number is carefully built up and celebrated with elaborate set pieces.</strong> &#8212; Little White Lies</p>

<p><strong>I did not care much for Wicked: Part One—I’m desperately tired of movies being one half of one movie, particularly when said movie has a run time of 160 minutes—but Ariana Grande delivers one of the best performances of the year as Glinda</strong>. &#8212; The Bulwark</p>



<p><strong>Radiant with combustible chemistry, Grande and Erivo play off each other with the testy flair of Olympic-class fencers</strong>. &#8212; Chicago Daily Herald</p>



<p><strong>Wicked isn’t really the vehicle to ponder deeper existential questions about the true nature of evil… It does, however, hit more than a few sweet spots for fellow misfits who see themselves in either Glinda or Elphaba.</strong> &#8212; Globe and Mail</p>



<p><strong>[Director John] Chu takes a stab at making a blockbuster for our times, one that doesn’t shy away from contending with the darkness of contemporary politics and society. Though Chu doesn’t always hit the mark, Wicked consistently dazzles.</strong> &#8212; Salon.com</p>

<p>The reviews are in, as <em>Madame Web</em>, the latest movie from Marvel Studios, released in theaters across the country.</p>



<p>It stars Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney and Adam Scott, among others.</p>



<p>This strong cast leads a film that is summarized as follows by IMDB:</p>



<p><em>Cassandra Webb develops the power to see the future. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies, if they can all survive a deadly present.</em></p>



<p>Sounds promising, right? Well&#8230;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-madame-web-reviews-what-marvel-fans-amp-critics-are-saying">&#8216;Madame Web&#8217; Reviews: What Marvel Fans &amp; Critics Are Saying</h2>



<p>The movie is based on a popular comic book, too, and yet&#8230; initial reviews for <em>Madame Web</em> are BAD.</p>



<p>Horrible. Terrible.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking SO incredibly abysmal that we sort of want to go see <em>Madame Web</em> now just to bask in its apparently historical awfulness.</p>



<p>Just consider what the following critics are saying about this movie&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Web isn&#8217;t as bad as you&#8217;ve heard. It&#8217;s so much worse&#8221;. &#8212; <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a></em></p>



<p>&#8220;On the basis of Madame Web, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe is now completely lifeless—and in no need of resuscitation.&#8221; &#8212; <em><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/">The Daily Beast</a></em></p>



<p>&#8220;Madame Web is one of these recently exhumed efforts. The film&#8230; has as much energy as an employee subjected to an ice breaker during a corporate retreat. It is an airless and stilted endeavor driven by a mechanical screenplay. Its lack of imagination would be astounding if it wasn’t so expected.&#8221; &#8212; <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em></p>



<p>&#8220;Nobody in this movie pops, or crackles, or snaps, or finds ways to energize the blah blah. The action’s not much; the acting’s minimalist bordering on somnambulant.&#8221; &#8212; <em><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/">The Chicago Times</a></em></p>



<p>&#8220;The struggle to find anything positive is a fruitless endeavor. Madame Web disappoints in every regard.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://movieweb.com/"><em>MovieWeb</em></a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-worst-review-for-madame-web-are-just-hilarious">The Worst Review For &#8216;Madame Web&#8217; Are Just Hilarious!</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://variety.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a></em>, for its part, writes that &#8220;Madame Web feels like a cross between an extended soda commercial and a teaser trailer for still more spinoffs.</p>



<p>&#8220;But you don’t have to be a soothsayer to see this particular franchise is D.O.A. — or a snob to expect better.&#8221;</p>



<p>From what we can gather,<em> Madame Web</em> is expected to make $30 million to $35 million after its Wednesday release and therefore have the lowest-ever domestic opening for a Sony Spider-Man movie.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the film has a dismal 17% positive rating on <em>Rotten Tomatoes</em>. Yes, that&#8217;s out of 100. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll go ahead and give the final negative words here to the website <em><a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2024/02/13/Madame-Web-movie-review/3881707781283/">UPI</a></em>, which wrote this week:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Madame Web is bad in ways even debacles like Catwoman and Batman &amp; Robin never broached. </em></p>



<p><em>Those movies had laughably misguided explorations of cat and bat powers, but Madame Web struggles to even explain its premise.</em></p>



<p><em>[But] at least Catwoman and Batman &amp; Robin believed in what they were doing. </em></p>



<p><em>They were wrong, but Madame Web just feels like a cynical copy of the bare minimum to qualify as a comic book movie.&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The Emoji Movie is about a city called Textopolis in which every emoji lives.</p>
<p>It tells the tale of one emoji named Gene who is determined to only have one facial expression, just like his animated friends.</p>
<p>And it may be the worst movie of all-time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We&#8217;re not being hyperbolic.</p>
<p>The movie review website Rotten Tomatoes, which cobbles together critiques from professionals around the country, has given it a 0 percent.</p>
<p>This means that not a single movie critic in the world has a positive thing to say about&nbsp;The&nbsp;Emoji&nbsp;Movi.</p>
<p>Not. A. Single. One.</p>
<p>How can a film flop so badly? What could make it such an abhorrent experience?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s turn to the experts, shall we? Scroll down for a look at why critics think&nbsp;The&nbsp;Emoji&nbsp;Movi is even worse than <a href="/2013/05/after-earth-revews-scathing/">After Earth</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>There could be far worse ways to spend 86 minutes. But maybe, just maybe, it&#8217;d be the better choice to spend those 86 minutes outside, or reading a book, or talking face-to-face with another human being. </em></p>
<p><em>Because The Emoji Movie could not be more meh. </em>&#8211; Katie Walsh, The Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p><em>The Emoji Movie shows how low Hollywood will sink for easy.</em>&#8211; Jordan Hoffman, The New York Daily News.</p>
<p><em>This movie&#8217;s &quot;believe in yourself&quot; message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic. </em>&#8211; Glenn Kenny, The New York Times.</p>
<p><em>Excuse me while I scan my phone for the vomit emoji.</em> &#8211; Mara Reinstein, MaraMovies.com.</p>
<p><em>Do yourself a favor, and swipe left on this one.</em> &#8211; Mike Reyes, CinemaBlend.com.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>As far as expanding on smartphone-related IP, this is an even weaker starting point than Sony Animation&#8217;s recent The Angry Birds Movie.</em> &#8211; Vadim Rizov, AV Club.</p>
<p><em>Looking back, it seems so obvious. We should have seen The Emoji Movie&#8217;s utter awfulness coming. </em></p>
<p><em>But as with so many other things in 2017, hindsight is not so much 20/20 as a giant regret generator.</em> &#8211; Alissa Wilkinson, Vox.</p>
<p><em>A film as mindless and disposable as most smartphone apps (and nowhere near as addictive), &quot;The Emoji Movie&quot; is a calamity that inadvertently shows how difficult it is to pull off the witty, imaginative world-building that Pixar makes seem so breezy. </em>&#8211; Tim Grierson, Screen International.</p>
<p><em>The good news is The Emoji Movie, co-written and directed by Tony Leondis, is not evil. The bad news is it&#8217;s just mediocre, or in emoji parlance, simply &quot;meh.&quot;</em> &#8211; Lindsey Bahr, The Associated Press.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>Hear that? It&#8217;s the end of the world.</em> &#8211; Johnny Oleksinski, The New York Post.</p>
<p>Incredibly, there appears to have been one thing worse than the actual&nbsp;The Emoji Movie:</p>
<p>The marketing campaign for&nbsp;The Emoji Movie.</p>
<p>See what we mean below&#8230; and prepare to recoil in horror!</p>

<p>That (dis)honor was awarded as soon as we learned of the new Will Smith film.</p>
<p>But it now seems possible that&nbsp;Collateral Beauty is simply the worst movie of the year&#8230; or of <em>any</em> year, for that matter.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The drama stars Smith as an ad executive in New York City who is mourning the loss of his daughter.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s doing so by penning personal letters to Death, Time, and Love in order to form a personal connection with the universe, while also hoping to receive some answers about his daughter&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>But things get weird (and ridiculously sentimental) when Death, Time and Love actually respond to Smith&#8217;s character&#8230; in the form of Helen Mirren,&nbsp;Keira Knightley and others.</p>
<p>The cast is exceptional.</p>
<p>The reviews have been anything but.</p>
<p>They are so bad, in fact, that it&#8217;s worth simply reading them for yourself.</p>
<p>Consider this a Public Service Announcement, as we aim to save readers the money they would have spent to actually go see Collateral Beauty.</p>
<p>Based on the following reviews, you&#8217;d be better off giving this cash to Jill Stein for a Presidential recount in Texas&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><strong>Jude Dry (IndieWire):</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing Smith play a failed father calls to mind the similarly heavy-handed The Pursuit of Happyness, the 2006 film that earned Smith an Oscar nomination that year. That movie at least tackled the somewhat noble goal of depicting the true story of a man struggling to raise himself out of poverty and homelessness.</p>
<p>&quot;With the bizarre way Whit and his crew talk about numbers and money, Collateral Beauty is just another story about spoiled rich people.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Owen Gleiberman (Variety):</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with Collateral Beauty, though, isn&rsquo;t the actors. It&rsquo;s the movie itself, which keeps piling on the devices until it becomes top-heavy.</p>
<p>&quot;A decade ago, in The Pursuit of Happyness, Smith proved he had the stuff to make a down-and-out character stingingly authentic, but in Collateral Beauty, when he gets all red-rimmed and teary, it feels like the actor&rsquo;s showcase it is, because the film&rsquo;s whole experience of suffering is engineered.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of using its metaphysical-deception plot as a conduit to genuine emotion, it just pushes the gimmickry further, suggesting that there&rsquo;s a secret reason why Mirren, Knightley, and Latimore are so good at leading Smith&rsquo;s wounded hero to a better place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/collateral-beauty-trailer"></a></figure></div>
<p><strong>David Rooney (The Hollywood Reporter): </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it hadn&rsquo;t come along so soon after Manchester By the Sea, Kenneth Lonergan&rsquo;s symphonic drama about a father emotionally crippled by loss, Collateral Beauty would look like silly high-concept Hollywood grief porn.</p>
<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s not to say David Frankel&rsquo;s all-star weepie doesn&rsquo;t work on its own manipulative terms, spreading its trail of goopy sentiment and inspirational homilies with technical finesse and some decent acting against the picturesque backdrop of New York City in the holidays. Audiences unconcerned about their sugar levels might eat it up.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Peter Bradshaw (The Guardian):</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;This horrifyingly yucky, toxically cutesy ensemble dramedy creates a Chernobyl atmosphere of manipulative sentimentality, topped off with an ending which M Night Shyamalan might reject as too ridiculous. This isn&rsquo;t Frank Capra. It is emotional literacy porn, like an aspirational self-help bestseller written by Keyser S&ouml;ze.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of it, I screamed the way polar bears are supposed to when they get their tongues frozen to the ice.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Dan Callahan (The Wrap):</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;An all-star cast submits to flagrant actor abuse in Collateral Beauty, which is every bit as lame as its title.</p>
<p>&quot;To paraphrase Groucho Marx, this is a movie where we watch Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and several other fine players bore holes in themselves so that we can watch the sap run out.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Alan Scherstuhl (Village Voice):</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;[Smith is] really convincing as someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to be there. It&rsquo;s the kind of serious performance you sometimes see from Adam Sandler or Robin Williams when they mistake &lsquo;seriousness&rsquo; for giving us nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Whitty (New York Daily News): </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of the actors are only passable, though, and Keira Knightley has turned into a parody of herself &#8211; eyes perpetually wide and sideways, mouth slightly open.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, she has one expression throughout the entire movie: Embarrassed disbelief. Perhaps that was her reaction to reading the script.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But not before she gets revenge for herself, her District and all the other Districts out there. So we assume, at least.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Hunger Games Mockingjay &#8211; Part 2 hits theaters on November 20, with <a href="/stars/jennifer-lawrence/">Jennifer Lawrence</a> putting on her pin and picking up her bow-and-arrow one final time.</p>
<p>What are critics saying about the final installment of this beloved franchise?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to assume you&#8217;re going to see it as soon as possible no matter what, but here&#8217;s a rundown of some positive and negative&nbsp;The Hunger Games&nbsp;Mockingjay&nbsp;&#8211; Part &nbsp;reviews:</p>
<p><em>As it turns out, they saved the best for last. &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8211; Part 2&quot; is a dark film, in a dramatically satisfying way. </em>&#8211; The Arizona Republic</p>
<p><em>Mockingjay &#8211; Part 2 deserves credit for incorporating real-world themes like media manipulation, terrorism and power vacuums, but its somber-faced, hand-wringing treatment can be tough to take seriously.</em> &#8211; Newsday</p>
<p><em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8212; Part 2 brings the four-film saga of Katniss Everdeen and her revolutionary war to a dutiful, fairly satisfying if undeniably attenuated conclusion.</em> &#8211; The Chicago Tribune</p>
<div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/the-hunger-games-our-favorite-characters-ranked/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"></div><h2 class="block-title">The Hunger Games: Our Favorite Characters, Ranked!</h2></div></a><div class="block-data"><div class="block-button"><a class="btn" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/the-hunger-games-our-favorite-characters-ranked/"><span>VIEW GALLERY</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="arrow-right" width="32px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 32 12"><g transform="translate(0,12) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill="#000000" stroke="none"><path d="M240 60 l0 -61 35 27 c19 14 35 30 35 34 0 4 -16 20 -35 34 l-35 27 0 -61z"/><path d="M4 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M84 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M164 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
<p><em>Mockingjay &#8211; Part 2 is a grim, dark, trippy, violent and sometimes just plain bizarre journey, which makes for a fitting if uneven conclusion to a film series that&#8217;s always been weird.</em> &#8211; The Chicago Sun-Times</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a rare film adaptation that improves upon the original text, highlighting its crucial themes while streamlining and shaping the action into something legible and gripping. </em>&#8211; Vanity Fair</p>
<p><em>This fourth and final entry into the cinematic world of Katniss and company is a bit of overkill, but certainly will please fans who can now say they have lived though the whole epic story which of course was cooked up by Suzanne Collins in her literary trilogy.</em> &#8211; Deadline</p>
<p><em>All those years ago when I turned my nose at the first film for its apparently franchise-friendly machinations, and at the second film for how the marketing contradicted the messaging, I was falling head-first into a trap. Well played, Katniss. Well played.</em>&nbsp;&#8211; Forbes</p>

<p>And the critics are apparently very happy to go along on a ride with the actor.</p>
<p>With the fifth edition of this action franchise set to hit theaters on July 31, scroll down for a look at what critics around the nation are saying about Cruise&#8217;s latest turn as Ethan Hunt&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>Rogue Nation, like the similarly propulsive Ghost Protocol, often feels like a pure instrument of fun, dragging Hunt through an ongoing series of precarious situations.&nbsp;</em>&#8211; A.A. Dowd</p>
<p><em>After taking a few stabs at the right formula, the series has finally found its voice, and Ethan Hunt and company give James Bond a real run for his blockbuster money.</em> &#8211; Randy Myers</p>
<p><em>Rogue Nation is a winning effort- much better than you&#8217;d expect from the fifth film in a series featuring a 53-year-old man as an action star. </em>&#8211; Stephen Silver</p>
<p><em>The opening stunt pretty much sums up the Mission: Impossible franchise: white-knuckle thrills teetering on the edge of absurdity.</em> &#8211; Jason Best</p>
<p><em>This M:I is entertaining in its schematic way; it&#8217;s impossible not to respond to the theme music on a Pavlovian level. There&#8217;s a sentimental attachment. But like Tom in that almighty opening plane stunt, I&#8217;m finding it harder and harder to hang on.</em> &#8211; Peter Bradshaw</p>
<p><em>Cruise is &#8211; and I say this nicely &#8211; a total maniac, which goes a long way toward cranking up an action sequence.</em> &#8211; Matt Pais</p>

<p>So most women out there probably don&#8217;t care about plot or dialogue.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve likely bought their tickets and are camping out for a front row seat as we type this.</p>
<p>But for those who <em>are</em> basing their weekend plans on&nbsp;Magic Mike XXL reviews from well-respected critics around the country, here&#8217;s a sampling of what they&#8217;re saying:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>As I sat there laughing, I realized I wasn&#8217;t only entertained. I was moved and exhilarated. Not since the days of peak Travolta and Dirty Dancing has a film so perfectly nailed something essential about movie lust.</em> &#8211; Wesley Morris</p>
<p><em>However discursive-and repetitive-the movie may be, it delivers the fantasy goods of formidable male bodies in motion, and ups the fantasy ante by making the men as sensitive, self-doubting and nurturing as they are virile.</em> &#8211; Joe Morgenstern</p>
<p><em>For a movie about taking risks, this sequel to the 2012 sleeper hit is far too cautious.</em> &#8211; John Hanlon</p>
<p><em>The initial banter between the lads &#8211; some of which is actually quite endearing and funny &#8211; eventually gives way to cheesy scenes designed to titillate rather than tickle the funny bone.</em> &#8211; Stella Papamichael</p>
<p><em>A hella fun, if naggingly problematic, road trip that examines its characters beyond their (admittedly beautiful) abs.</em> &#8211; Annlee Ellingson</p>

<p>As part of their promotional tour for the blockbuster, <a href="/videos/bryce-dallas-howard-cries-on-command/">Bryce Dallas Howard cried</a> on command during a Conan appearance; and <a href="/videos/chris-pratt-tries-to-run-in-high-heels/">Chris Pratt ran in high heels</a>.</p>
<p>But just because the stars entertained us on talk shows, does that mean the rebooted movie franchise will entertain us in theaters?</p>
<p>Critics from around the globe have chimed in with their&nbsp;Jurassic World reviews below&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>At its best, it&#8217;s good enough to take your mind off its worst, which is saying a lot</em>. &#8211; David Edelstein</p>
<p><em>Pratt proved in &quot;Guardians&quot; that he could handle hunky leading man roles, and his combination of physicality, charisma and attitude prove hard to resist one more time.</em> &#8211; Kenneth Turan</p>
<p><em>I enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to exactly the same degree I enjoyed Jurassic World.</em> &#8211; Chris Klimek</p>
<p><em>Jurassic World is ersatz Spielberg. It&#8217;s a knock-off that, even with the brand tag of the filmmaking titan as executive producer, makes the credit feel faux.</em> &#8211; Lisa Kennedy</p>
<p><em>Just showing us dinosaurs isn&#8217;t enough anymore, which is why Jurassic World is very entertaining, but not amazing. </em>&#8211; Willie Waffle</p>
<p><em>When its focus is on dino-centric destruction, Jurassic World is wonderful. When it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a dump &#8212; an expositional dump, to be precise. </em>&#8211; Bill Gibron</p>
<p><em>Jurassic World is precisely what every Jurassic Park fan would hope it might be. It delivers fair and square.</em> &#8211; David Sexton</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Based on a <a href="/videos/entourage-honest-trailer/">certain&nbsp;Entourage trailer</a>, this HBO show-turned-movie is racist, homophobic and misogynistic.</p>
<p>But is it entertaining?!?</p>
<p>With the big screen version of this beloved comedy hitting theaters on Friday, critics from around the country are now weighing in on Vince, Ari and the boys.</p>
<p>The boys may be back. But are they <em>welcome</em> back? Find out in the following Entourage review roundup&#8230;</p>

<p><em>The film is stuck in the inconsequential rut of the series. The characters are static, and the comedy is situational rather than dramatic.</em> &#8211; Peter Keough</p>
<p><em>The movie has none of the fizz of the earliest of the series&#8217; eight seasons, and watching it summons that vague blank familiarity of discovering a show you used to watch is unexpectedly still on the air. &#8211;</em> Mark Olsen</p>
<p><em>It may be not much more than a heavily branded romp through a Hollywood fantasyland, but it&#8217;s got a pulse. It&#8217;s easy fun. No one ever died from reading People magazine. </em>&#8211; Laura Zarum</p>
<p><em>Put it this way: Gary Busey is in the movie. You&#8217;ll forget it faster than he does</em>. &#8211; Kyle Smith</p>
<p><em>There is some good, silly fun, and seeing Piven go nuts is so delightful it is disappointing this film has him working on his anger management. </em>&#8211; Nell Minow</p>
<p><em>Just loud, boorish frat-boy wish-fulfilmment stuff, festooned with wink-wink celebrity cameos.</em> &#8211; Frank Swietek</p>
<p><em>It is escapism, and entertaining when we get to go along for the ride, no matter how ridiculous and over-the-top.</em> &#8211; Willie Waffle</p>
