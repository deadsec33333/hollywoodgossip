<p>Chris married Adrienne in 2011 and she <a href="/2013/02/chris-bosh-wife-did-she-really-do-lil-wayne/">may have banged Lil Wayne</a> at some point.</p>
<p>They welcomed their first child, a son named Jackson, in May 2012 and Bosh is also the father of five-year-old daughter, Trinity, with ex-girlfriend <a href="/2011/03/allison-mathis-casting-on-basketball-wives-rejected-by-chris-bos/">Allison Mathis</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a perfect day to witness a miracle and be humbled by the beautiful process of Life and Love,&#8221; Adrienne Tweeted soon after becoming a mother again. &#8220;We appreciate all the well wishes, positivity, and words of support we have received! To my husband&#8230;you continue to bring life to my dreams and joy to my world. I Thank You for helping me welcome this perfect little angel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miami Heat forward Chris Bosh returned to his home around 12:30 a.m. today after an evening celebrating in South Beach&#8230; only to find the residence ransacked.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials tell TMZ that a jewelry drawer was open and <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/04/chris-bosh-burglarized-miami-home-jewelry/">Bosh estimates</a> approximately $340,000 worth of items was taken.</p>

<p>Because there was no forced entry, and because the culprit would seem to have known Bosh would be out partying, authorities are looking into anyone who had access to the home.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time this year that Bosh has faced trouble off the court.</p>
<p>Last month, a rumor circulated that <a href="/2013/02/chris-bosh-wife-did-she-really-do-lil-wayne/">Lil Wayne banged his wife</a>. Seriously!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Did Chris Bosh&#8217;s wife Adrienne Williams really sleep with Lil Wayne, as the rapper boasted in an NBA All-Star weekend rant denouncing all things Heat?</p>
<p>She hasn&#8217;t directly addressed Weezy&#8217;s comments, but the NBA star&#8217;s wife did re-tweet a pair of (possibly) telling quotes by friends to that effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people attack those who have the peace &amp; joy they wish they had! Pay them no mind! Live your dream, strut &amp; wave,&#8221; wrote Gabrielle Union.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>Gabrielle is dating Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh&#8217;s teammate, so it&#8217;s not a stretch for the actress to refer to Lil Wayne saying he f&#8211;ked Bosh&#8217;s wife.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Adrienne re-tweeted Union&#8217;s comment, as well as another that said, &#8220;Truth prevails. Today stand in your truth and ignore the chatter around and about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people create hate for profit, and some people create love for free. Pay no mind to the haters, embrace the love&#8230;. They will never bring me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Damn straight.</p>
<p>In front of a crowd in Houston, Lil Wayne went OFF on the whole franchise, saying &#8220;F&#8211;k LeBron, f&#8211;k She-Wade, f&#8211;k Chris Bosh, f&#8211;k all of them ni&#8211;as, man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, and, and <a href="/2013/02/lil-wayne-i-f-ked-chris-boshs-wife-and-f-k-the-heat/">I f&#8211;ked Chris Bosh&#8217;s wife</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lil Wayne&#8217;s rant stems from an incident that took place last week in which he claims he was <a href="/2013/02/lil-wayne-ejected-from-heat-game/">kicked out of a Heat game</a> against the Lakers in Miami.</p>
<p>He claims this happened solely because he was cheering for visiting L.A. on the Heat&#8217;s floor, but a fan says it was because he made a gun gesture.</p>
<p>Just another day in the life of Weezy.</p>

<p>Debuting tonight before the Heat&#8217;s 115-107 win over the Celtics, the video shows Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, LeBron James &amp; Co. in all their grandiosity.</p>
<p>In a word &#8230; EH. Last year&#8217;s intro video, set to &#8220;In The Air Tonight,&#8221; just invoked a visceral sense of impending awesomeness, even if you loathe the Heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the Lights&#8221; is a little underwhelming. Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing, though. After last year&#8217;s Finals failure, maybe Miami should let its play do the talking:</p>

<p>Now he&#8217;s looking for <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/06/07/chris-bosh-nba-judge-custody-war-battle-miami-heat-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a judge to force her hand</a>.</p>
<p>Bosh and Mathis have a contentious relationship, battling over custody and her appearance on <em>Basketball Wives,</em> which he put the ki-Bosh on.</p>

<p>Right now, there&#8217;s a temporary court-ordered arrangement in place in which they share custody, and the daughter, Trinity, is with Allison.</p>
<p>Last week, Bosh filed a motion asking the judge to temporarily alter the terms so that Trinity could come to the Heat-Mavericks games.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am embarking on a new chapter of my life by making it into the finals for the first time in my professional career,&#8221; writes Bosh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very important to me to have the people closest and dear to my heart to be able to share these moments with me.&#8221;</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"><span style="display: none;"> </span></div>&#8220;If we can make this happen please respond asap and I will set up the arrangements for pick up/drop off without you even having to lift a finger.&#8221;
<p>According to the legal docs, Bosh, who <a href="/2011/04/chris-bosh-and-adrienne-williams-married/">married Adrienne Williams</a> earlier this year, never heard back from his baby mama and is not happy.</p>
<p>So far, the judge has yet to rule on the matter, but a source close to Allison Mathis tells us she does not want to change the arrangement.</p>
<p>Regardless, Bosh&#8217;s turn for custody begins June 11. With the Heat losing a nail-biter last night, the best-of-seven Finals is tied 2-2.</p>
<p>That means there&#8217;s a Game 6 Sunday, June 12 in Miami! At least Chris can spend QT with his little girl while the Mavs celebrate &#8230;</p>

<p>Congratulations on the wedding he denied took place!</p>
<p>While we now know Bosh wed Adrienne Nicole Williams, the baller denied that he had done so at an NBA news conference shortly thereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/gallery/chris-bosh-and-adrienne-williams/"></a></p>
<p>According to the courts in Miami-Dade County, Chris and Adrienne are <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/04/27/chris-bosh-marriage-certificate-adrienne-nicole-williams-miami-heat-basketball-nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially husband and wife</a>, whether he acknowledges it publicly or not.</p>
<p>Chris&#8217; relationship with his ex, <a href="/2011/03/allison-mathis-casting-on-basketball-wives-rejected-by-chris-bos/">Allison Mathis</a>, has been playing out in the media thanks to her attempts to get on the show <em>Basketball Wives</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps he just wants to keep his private life under wraps from now on after that experience. Hard to blame the seven-footer for that, really.</p>
<p>In other news, Bosh scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Heat ousted Philadelphia from the playoffs last night. Nice work!</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/04/chris-bosh-and-adrienne-williams-married/">Chris Bosh and Adrienne Williams: Married!</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>

<p>But Chris was reportedly PISSED when he heard that producers were in talks to bring in Mathis and moved quickly and strongly in order to <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/07/basketball-wives-chris-bosh-girlfriend-allison-mathis-royce-reed-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nix that idea</a>.</p>


<p>Chris was so bent on preventing her from blabbing about him and their daughter on TV that producers decided she wasn&#8217;t worth the headache.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BASKETBALL NON-WIFE</strong>: <em>Allison Mathis and Chris Bosh are not married. Nor are they even an item anymore. Nor will she be talking about it on TV, thanks to him</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, with Mathis out of the picture, Royce Reed is likely to stay on, barring any last-minute change, and free to trash Dwight Howard for another year.</p>
<p>If only Chris Bosh and his Miami Heat teammates could close out games the way he finished off Allison Mathis&#8217; chances of reality stardom. Chokers.</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/03/allison-mathis-casting-on-basketball-wives-rejected-by-chris-bos/">Allison Mathis&#8217; Casting on Basketball Wives: Rejected By Chris Bosh!</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>
