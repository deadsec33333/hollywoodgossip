<p>Last night, Mikey hosted SNL for the first time. Needless to say, this is definitely an exciting time in her career!</p>



<p>As the reaches one major milestone after another, get to know more about Mikey here!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-began-acting-as-a-teen">Mikey Madison Began Acting As a Teen</h2>



<p>Born in Los Angeles in 1999, Mikey began appearing in short films when she was a teenager. Her first handful of roles were in short films, including 2013&#8217;s <em>Retirement </em>and <em>Pani&#8217;s Box</em>.</p>



<p>Her first feature length film was <em>Liza, Liza, Skies are Grey, </em>which was released in 2017. In 2016, she was cast in a starring role in the dramedy <em>Better Things</em>. She played creator and star Pamela Adlon&#8217;s teen daughter Max.</p>



<p>Prior to her hit role in <em>Anora</em>, she appeared in other major films like <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>, <em>The Addams Family</em>, and <em>Scream</em>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anora-is-her-breakout-role">&#8216;Anora&#8217; Is Her Breakout Role</h2>



<p>In 2024, Mikey became a major star when she portrayed the titular sex worker in <em>Anora</em>. Writer-director Sean Baker had written the part specifically for the actress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-was-a-horseback-rider-before-she-was-an-actress">Mikey Madison Was A Horseback Rider Before She Was an Actress</h2>



<p>Before devoting herself to acting full-time, Mikey had a very intense career path: horseback riding. Her family is made up of dedicated equestrians and cowboys, according to a January 2025 profile in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mikey-madison-anora-lady-in-the-lake-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Cut</em>.</a></p>



<p>While she&#8217;s no longer a competitive horseback rider, the <em>Better Things </em>star has retained an interest in horses. Early in that profile, the writer notes that she was perusing horses available for adoption.</p>



<p>She admitted that it was &#8220;painful&#8221; to give up riding to pursue acting. &#8220;I loved the ritual of getting to the barn and taking care of my horse, but it’s kind of an isolating sport,” she told the outlet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-has-a-twin-brother">She Has A Twin Brother</h2>



<p>Mikey has four siblings, including one twin brother. It&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s very close with her twin, and she&#8217;s referenced him in a few interviews.</p>



<p>She mentioned wanting to collaborate with her brother on a few future projects in the above-mentioned <em>Cut </em>interview. &#8220;I have a couple of personal stories that I’d love to work with my twin brother on,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Additionally, she mentioned that she spoke with her brother after finding out about her Oscar nomination in a <em><a href="https://variety.com/lists/oscars-nomination-reactions-ariana-grandes-demi-moore-mikey-madison/mikey-madison-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> </em>interview. &#8220;I was on FaceTime with my mom, my dad, my dog and my twin brother this morning, and I’m humbled; absolutely overjoyed,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s clear that they&#8217;re very close now, Mikey admitted that back when they were growing up there was some distance between her and her twin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My twin brother would pretend that we weren&#8217;t siblings, people would be like on the last day of school &#8216;Miles why would you be getting into [Mikey&#8217;s] car with her?&#8217; and he was like, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s my sister,'&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGoTBupUZT8&amp;pp=ygUPdyBtaWtleSBtYWRpc29u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W</a>.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;He has since apologized,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-is-a-proud-dog-amp-cat-mom">Mikey Madison Is a Proud Dog &amp; Cat Mom</h2>



<p>Given her background in horseback riding, it should come as no surprise to learn that Mikey has a soft spot for animals. She gushed about both of her pets in an August 2024 <em><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61777335/mikey-madison-interview-2024/">Esquire</a> </em>profile.</p>



<p>Her pets have cute names that go hand-in-hand with each other. &#8220;His name is Jam, because I have a cat named Biscuit,&#8221; she told the magazine. Adorable! </p>

<p>There was so much news coming out of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Academy Awards</a> that you might have missed the controversy involving Megan Thee Stallion and comedian Hannah Berner.</p>



<p>Alongside her fellow <em>Summer House</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/craig-conover-denies-other-girls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paige DeSorbo</a>, Berner did a very brief red carpet interview with Meghan at Vanity Fair&#8217;s post-Oscar party.</p>



<p>The whole conversation lasted just over a minute and consisted mainly of Hannah gushing about what a big fan she is.</p>



<p>And yet, the response from the general public has been so overwhelmingly negative that Berner felt the need to issue an apology.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@vanityfair/video/7477476988035304750" data-video-id="7477476988035304750" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@vanityfair" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vanityfair?refer=embed">@vanityfair</a> <p>Reminder: <a title="megantheestallion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/megantheestallion?refer=embed">#MeganTheeStallion</a> is that girl. <a title="vfoscarparty" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/vfoscarparty?refer=embed">#VFOscarParty</a></p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Vanity Fair" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7477477210467863342?refer=embed">♬ original sound &#8211; Vanity Fair</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>You can watch the video above, and you&#8217;ll probably be able to pinpoint the moment when the interview goes slightly awry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-red-carpet-interview-goes-off-the-rails">A red carpet interview goes off the rails</h2>



<p>&#8220;When I want to fight someone, I listen to your music,&#8221; Berner said a few seconds into the interview, prompting Megan to reply:</p>



<p>“You want to throw that fighting sh-t out the window. You want to get cute and be a bad b-tch.”</p>



<p>Perhaps not picking up on the cue, Hannah continued with the violence and anger motif, saying, “When people are talking shit, I go, ‘Turn on Megan Thee Stallion!’” </p>

<p>“Body-ody-ody, I look beautiful, I look so great,&#8221; Megan said in a valiant effort to nudge the conversation in a more normal direction.</p>



<p>But Hannah persisted with the weird grimness, noting that Megan &#8220;through so many dark things.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;I just look in the mirror like, &#8216;Damn, you that girl. So go outside and act like you that girl,'&#8221; Megan replied, yet again keeping things positive.</p>



<p>As you probably already know, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/10/tory-lanez-finally-charged-in-shooting-of-megan-thee-stallion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Megan was shot </a>in the foot by former boyfriend Tory Lanez in 2020. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/tory-lanez-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison-for-shooting-of-megan-thee-stallion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tory is currently in prison</a> for the crime.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s probably one of the &#8220;dark&#8221; things to which Hannah was referring.</p>

<p>But this was an Oscars afterparty, and Megan obviously would&#8217;ve preferred to keep things lighter. Still, the interview wasn&#8217;t a total trainwreck.</p>



<p>Most folks who were critical of the conversation would probably just say that Hannah could use some more media training. But some people went a lot further and accused the comic of <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hannah-berner-responds-to-megan-thee-stallion-interview-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hurling racist &#8220;microaggressions&#8221; at Megan</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hannah-issues-an-apology">Hannah issues an apology</h2>



<p>The situation got so bad that Hannah felt the need to issue an apology today.</p>



<p>“Interviewing Megan Thee Stallion was a dream of mine. I love her music and It’s my go to whenever I need to boost my confidence before a show,” Berner wrote in her Instagram Story (via <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hannah-berner-responds-to-megan-thee-stallion-interview-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>). “Looking back. at the interview, I wish I used any other word except ‘fight’ to describe how her songs impact me.”</p>



<p>“It was a careless choice of words and though there was no ill intent, I recognize and acknowledge that what I said has a deeper meaning and I am so sorry to Megan. I appreciate everyone who brought this to my attention.”</p>



<p>Whatever your feelings about the interview, it seems clear that Hannah didn&#8217;t mean any harm and has learned from the experience. Hopefully, all parties involved will be able to peacefully move on from this one.</p>

<p>Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber could have had an awkward run-in at the Oscars.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Academy Awards ceremony</a> was a night of fashion, honors, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/michelle-trachtenberg-in-memoriam-snub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remembrance</a>, and this one near miss.</p>



<p>Selena and Hailey don&#8217;t exactly have a feud. </p>



<p>But there may be just too many complexities between them for things to ever be normal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-selena-gomez-carefully-avoid-hailey-bieber-at-the-oscars">Did Selena Gomez carefully avoid Hailey Bieber at the Oscars?</h2>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14455745/Why-Selena-Gomez-avoided-Justin-Biebers-wife-Hailey-Bieber-Vanity-Fair-Oscar-party.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, Selena Gomez was careful to adeptly sidestep any potential encounter with Hailey Bieber at the Oscars afterparty. But not for the dramatic reasons that some may assume.</p>



<p>“She just wanted to avoid being photographed with her or near her,&#8221; the report explained, &#8220;because then 100 stories are born.&#8221;</p>



<p>That same report acknowledged: &#8220;Selena took a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/selena-gomez-hailey-baldwin-pose-for-pic-send-important-message-to-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">picture with Hailey</a> in the past and it didn’t feel right.”</p>

<p>A follow-up report by <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/why-selena-gomez-avoided-hailey-bieber-at-vanity-fair-oscars-afterparty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em> alleges that Selena Gomez was focusing upon &#8220;self care&#8221; when she avoided a Hailey Bieber encounter.</p>



<p>“Selena looked gorgeous and felt amazing at the Oscars,&#8221; the insider affirmed. </p>



<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; that same source emphasized, &#8220;she wasn’t going to let anything ruin her special night.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-selena-gomez-and-hailey-bieber-interact-people-talk">When Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber interact, people talk</h2>



<p>&#8220;She’s gotten a lot better at avoiding drama,&#8221; the insider added. It&#8217;s been over a year since the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/selena-gomez-quits-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globes drama</a> from January 2024, but Selena clearly hasn&#8217;t forgotten.</p>



<p>&#8220;And that means falling into any traps that could cause any negative buzz or unnecessary anxiety for her,” the source spelled out.</p>



<p>“So yes, while she didn’t obsess about it, avoiding a potential Hailey Bieber viral moment was in the back of her head,&#8221; the insider explained. &#8220;It’s not always possible, but she’s learned to avoid potentially awkward moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she had bumped into her, she definitely would have said hello,&#8221; the source stressed about Selena Gomez&#8217;s attitude towards a potential Hailey Bieber run-in.</p>



<p>“Selena has nothing against Hailey,&#8221; the insider then assured. &#8220;That’s never really been her focus, and she’s certainly way over the long-standing trend of pitting women against each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source continued: &#8220;So, not putting herself in a situation like that is just about self-care and not giving haters any ammunition.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nothing-but-good-vibes-all-around-apparently">Nothing but good vibes all around, apparently</h2>



<p>“She only wishes the best for Hailey, Justin and their new baby,&#8221; the inside source concluded. &#8220;Selena’s Oscar night was all about good vibes, celebrating her film <em>Emilia Pérez</em> and her costars, and the industry she loves.”</p>



<p>We do fully believe that Selena Gomez wishes Hailey Bieber and her family well. That sounds very believable.</p>



<p>At the same time, we have to acknowledge that we cannot confirm reports that she &#8220;avoided&#8221; Hailey. These Oscars parties can be very large. Sometimes, two people merely do not mingle at an event.</p>



<p>You know how Selena likely worries what people will say if she and Hailey bump into each other? Well, people will say things even if they don&#8217;t speak. The absence of a &#8220;story&#8221; can become a story itself.</p>

<p>Demi Moore losing the Oscar <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Mikey Madison</a>, an actress in her 20s, felt a <em>little </em>on the nose.</p>



<p>But that is what happened. The Best Actress award at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2025 Academy Awards</a> went to the lead from <em>Anora</em>, not the lead to <em>The Substance</em>.</p>



<p>Frankly, it just felt like a continuation of <em>The Substance</em>. Thematically, anyway.</p>



<p>At the moment of the announcement, Demi Moore appeared to say something. What was it?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-beat-demi-moore-for-the-coveted-best-actress-oscar">Mikey Madison beat Demi Moore for the coveted Best Actress Oscar</h2>



<p>The reactions to Demi Moore losing the Oscar and Mikey Madison winning it have nothing to do with Madison or her acting. She&#8217;s excellent and she deserves her flowers.</p>



<p>Even her big fans are balancing excitement for her with an acknowledgment that Moore has received too little recognition for her phenomenal career.</p>



<p>However, many can only imagine how Moore is feeling. <em>The Substance</em> is, after all, about the intersection of ageism and misogyny in the entertainment industry. Now, she&#8217;s not even winning an Oscar for it.</p>

<p>At the moment of the announcement that Mikey Madison had won the Best Actress Oscar for <em>Anora</em>, Demi Moore appeared to say something. But what?</p>



<p>According to a lip reader for <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14454501/Demi-Moore-shock-snub-Oscars-lip-reader-reveals-reaction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, what the legendary actress said may have been a <em>bit </em>sarcastic.</p>



<p>“Demi says ‘nice,’ but she isn’t smiling when she says it,” claimed Nicola Hickling. “Her body is almost nodding like she had to force herself to say it.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-watching-demi-moore-lose-to-mikey-madison-has-a-lot-of-people-talking">Watching Demi Moore lose to Mikey Madison has a lot of people talking</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/demi-moore-full-frontal-nude-the-substance-cannes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Substance</a></em> is a body horror film that follows Demi Moore&#8217;s character, an aging actress, whose career has dried up. </p>



<p>Out of desperation, she uses a black market drug (the titular substance) to create a younger copy of herself, but the two soon grow to resent each other. The results are catastrophic.</p>



<p>The film&#8217;s commentary on ageism in the entertainment industry is not subtle. At all. Watching her lose the Oscar was hard for many people. But that Demi Moore lost to 25-year-old Mikey Madison felt a little <em>pointed</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-683x1024.jpg" alt="Demi Moore on February 25, 2025 at the Oscars." class="wp-image-520520" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_demimoore_03-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the 97th Annual Oscars Nominees Dinner at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on February 25, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Did Demi Moore lose because of ageism? Did she lose because of the pernicious intersection of ageism and misogyny that is only magnified in the entertainment industry?</p>



<p>Not <em>necessarily</em>. But these are factors that we cannot casually disregard.</p>



<p>Remember, even the most unhinged Oscars voters (folks, many of these people are absurd) likely aren&#8217;t going, &#8220;well, I&#8217;m not voting for a woman in her 60s.&#8221; Most bias of this form takes place in the unconscious.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-as-for-the-best-actress-winner">As for the Best Actress winner &#8230;</h2>



<p>Mikey Madison thanked the production company behind <em>Anora </em>and thanked Sean Baker, the director. Then, she delved into an important message related to her Oscar-winning film.</p>



<p>“I just want to recognize and honor the sex&nbsp;worker community,&#8221; she emphasized. (As it happens, the Oscars took place the night before <a href="https://www.nswp.org/event/international-sex-worker-rights-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Sex Worker Rights Day</a>)</p>



<p>“Yes, I will continue to support and&nbsp;be an ally,&#8221; Madison affirmed. &#8220;All of the incredible people,&nbsp;the women that I’ve had the&nbsp;privilege of meeting from that&nbsp;community has been one of the&nbsp;highlights of this incredible&nbsp;experience.”</p>

<p>2024 was a year that Drake would probably like to forget. And thus far, 2025 is not looking much better for the Canadian hip hop legend.</p>



<p>Drake&#8217;s feud with Kendrick Lamar remains the music industry&#8217;s top story, thanks in part to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-kendrick-lamar-bad-blood-halftime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick&#8217;s Super Bowl halftime show</a>.</p>



<p>(Which came just one week after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick picked up five Grammys</a> for his Drake-targeted diss track &#8220;Not Like Us.&#8221;)</p>



<p>The humiliation continued Sunday night, as<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Oscars host Conan O&#8217;Brien</a> mentioned the drama in a joke that went too far in the eyes of some viewers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conan-s-drake-joke-receives-a-mixed-reaction">Conan&#8217;s Drake joke receives a mixed reaction</h2>



<p>“We’re halfway through the show, which means it’s time for Kendrick Lamar to come out and call Drake a pedophile,” Conan quipped at the ceremony&#8217;s midway point. </p>



<p>After a brief pause and a round of shocked laughter, the late night host added, “Don’t worry, I’m lawyered up.”</p>



<p>The crowd at the Dolby Theater seemed mostly in favor of the joke. But on social media, the reaction was far more negative.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess pedophilia and molestation is now normalized and ok to joke about. Do y’all not see what is happening? If this was about anyone BUT Drake he would never be allowed at the Oscars again,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/hatingway2hard/status/1896389863752257626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote one</a> X (formerly Twitter) user.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diddy actually had victims, but let’s make a joke about Drake which were false accusations,&#8221; another <a href="https://x.com/keepitreal_4L/status/1896405810655490317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimed in</a>.</p>



<p>Podcaster Van Lathan <a href="https://x.com/VanLathan/status/1896386912174399930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote simply</a>, &#8220;This is wack.&#8221;</p>



<p>But as one user pointed out, Conan did not actually level any sort of allegations at Drake.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny to see people freaking out that Conan called Drake a pedophile when instead he just referenced the thing that happened that everyone hasn&#8217;t shut the f&#8211;k up about for months,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/josiahhughes/status/1896588834370113648">this person wrote</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-683x1024.jpg" alt="Conan O'Brien and Liza Powel O'Brien attend the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 02, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California." class="wp-image-520528" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202971336-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Conan O&#8217;Brien and Liza Powel O&#8217;Brien attend the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 02, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, the Drake-Kendrick back-and-forth has been going on for months, and while we may not be accustomed to hearing pedophilia jokes at the Oscars, it&#8217;s important to note that Conan was just referencing recent events in the world of pop culture, not taking any shots at Drake.</p>



<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a good chance that last night&#8217;s joke might wind up getting cited as evidence soon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/drake-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake is currently suing Universal Music Group</a> &#8212; which is <em>his</em> label as well as Kendrick&#8217;s &#8212; alleging that the company was complicit in pushing lies about his personal life (via Lamar&#8217;s music).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s too soon to say how that situation will play out. But one thing you can be sure of: The Drake vs. Kendrick feud is far from over.</p>

<p>Well, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Academy Awards</a> have come and gone.</p>



<p>The night was light on surprises, but many deserving people received life-changing honors, so it was a memorable occasion in that sense.</p>



<p>Sadly, Timothee Chalamet was not one of the night&#8217;s big winners. He would&#8217;ve been the youngest Best Actor recipient in Oscars history, but he lost out to Adrien Brody, who won for <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p>



<p>And adding insult to injury is the fact that Timmy C. now has to deal with a weird mini-controversy surrounding the announcement of the award.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kylie-goes-missing-during-timothee-s-big-moment">Kylie goes missing during Timothee&#8217;s big moment</h2>



<p>Eagle-eyed viewers noticed that when the cameras turned to Chalamet ahead of the presentation, he was no longer seated next to Kylie Jenner, as he had been throughout the night.</p>



<p>Instead, Timothee was now seated next to his mother, Nicole Flender.</p>



<p>Kylie fans might have been upset by the new seating arrangement, but apparently, it was all worked out in advance.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202918325-1024x683.jpg" alt="TimothÃ©e Chalamet and Kylie Jenner attend the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025 in Hollywood, California.

<p>Nicole had been Timothee&#8217;s date throughout the usual awards season stops, including the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/sag-awards-2025-jane-fonda-steals-the-show-as-conclave-demi-moore-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG Awards</a>, where he took home Best Actor.</p>



<p>So maybe Timmy has come to think of his mom as a good luck charm. Or maybe he just wanted her by his side for the most consequential moment of his career.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, everyone involved seemed happy with the decision, and that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kylie-and-timothee-are-still-going-strong">Kylie and Timothee are still going strong</h2>

<p>Despite rumors to the contrary, there&#8217;s been no evidence of trouble in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-pack-on-pda-at-a-complete-unknown-premiere-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timmy&#8217;s relationship</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, onlookers say the couple packed on the PDA throughout the evening. </p>



<p>Kylie skipped the red carpet, but she was reportedly close by Timothee&#8217;s side throughout the rest of the evening.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="718" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2202915277-1024x718.jpg" alt="Kylie Jenner and TimothÃ©e Chalamet attend the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025 in Hollywood, California.

<p>So while there might not be any truth to the claims that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/is-kylie-jenner-pregnant-timothee-chalamet-would-be-the-likely-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie is pregnant with Timothee&#8217;s baby</a>, it seems that the breakup rumors are equally bogus.</p>



<p>With any luck, she&#8217;ll be his plus-one at many award show ceremonies in the years to come.</p>



<p>And when Timmy eventually wins Best Actor, maybe Kylie will be seated on his other side.</p>

<p>Joe Alwyn did more than merely attend <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2025 Oscars</a> &#8212; he was also a presenter.</p>



<p>After all, he was in one of this awards season&#8217;s strongest contenders. </p>



<p>Even so, many people know Alwyn for his erstwhile <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/joe-alwyn-breaks-silence-on-loving-committed-relationship-with-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship with Taylor Swift</a>. Meanwhile, he is fairly private about his personal life.</p>



<p>That romance ended nearly two years ago. It&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;d like to put it behind him, and refocus attention upon his acting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-alwyn-attended-the-2025-oscars">Joe Alwyn attended the 2025 Oscars</h2>



<p>On Sunday, March 2, Joe Alwyn served as a presenter during the 2025 Academy Awards.</p>



<p>He stood on the stage to help present the award for Best Cinematography.</p>



<p>As you are likely already aware, that particular award went to Lol Crawley for <em>The Brutalist</em>. Alwyn portrayed the son of Guy Pearce&#8217;s character in the film.</p>

<p>While walking the red carpet ahead of the Oscars ceremony, Joe Alwyn wore a simple black tux with a white dress shirt and a black bow tie. Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; the Oscars are one of the few events where unironically wearing a bow tie is not necessarily a red flag.</p>



<p>With the actor wearing such a simple, even basic ensemble, his brooch caught a lot of eyes. The purple and yellow petals of the motif were eye-catching, as was its use of color. </p>



<p>Sometimes, an achromatic color scheme like a tux is just a backdrop for the <em>real </em>star of the show.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-though-joe-alwyn-did-not-take-home-an-oscar-he-has-been-focusing-upon-his-career">Though Joe Alwyn did not take home an Oscar, he has been focusing upon his career</h2>



<p>Though <em>The Brutalist</em> was up for ten potential Academy Awards this year and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/oscar-winners-2025-list-anora-the-brutalist-1236323560/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won</a> three of them, none singled out Joe Alwyn.</p>



<p>The Best Picture nomination would at least include everyone involved (in theory). Adrien Brody received a nomination (and win!) for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Guy Pearce received a nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Felicity Jones received a nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.</p>



<p>Then came Best Directing, Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), Best Production Design, and Best Writing (Original Screenplay). Daniel Blumberg <em>did </em>take home the Oscar for the score, and Alwyn helped present Lol Crawley with the cinematography award.</p>

<p>Even though it is not his primary claim to fame, Joe Alwyn takes his acting career very seriously.</p>



<p>However, even now, he is most famous &#8212; by far &#8212; for his six-year relationship with Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>The two got together (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/05/ashley-benson-and-cara-delevingne-broke-up-because-2020-hates-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cara Delevingne</a> introduced them) when Taylor was taking a break from the spotlight. The two had a long, quiet romance, and only broke up in early 2023.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-would-prefer-for-people-to-know-him-as-an-actor">We would prefer for people to know him as an actor</h2>



<p>Joe and Taylor avoided the limelight &#8212; as much as is possible for one of the most famous people on the planet and her boyfriend &#8212; for much of their romance.</p>



<p>Their breakup ultimately stirred more conversation than their quiet relationship. Even Taylor&#8217;s post-split album seemed to focus more lyrics upon (people believe) her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/taylor-swift-and-matty-healy-split-dirtbag-summer-is-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mistaken dalliance with Matty Healy</a> than on Alwyn.</p>



<p>Alwyn is an actor. That is his job, and he would prefer for public attention to focus upon his career. Perhaps, one day, he will get his wish.</p>

<p>Michelle Trachtenberg tragically passed away last week.</p>



<p>Many of her fans and former costars are still in shock. This was so unexpected.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/oscar-winners-2025-mikey-madison-anora-win-big/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Oscars</a> have come and gone with relatively few surprises in the mix.</p>



<p>But this year&#8217;s In Memoriam segment of the Oscars snubbed Trachtenberg. And she was not the only conspicuous exclusion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="708" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-708x1024.jpg" alt="Michelle Trachtenberg on February 9, 2020." class="wp-image-520483" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-708x1024.jpg 708w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-208x300.jpg 208w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-768x1110.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-1417x2048.jpg 1417w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-664x960.jpg 664w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-747x1080.jpg 747w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-830x1200.jpg 830w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_02-scaled.jpg 1771w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Trachtenberg attends the 28th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party sponsored by IMDb, Neuro Drinks and Walmart on February 09, 2020.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-michelle-trachtenberg-not-appear-in-the-oscars-in-memoriam-tribute">Why did Michelle Trachtenberg not appear in the Oscars &#8216;In Memoriam&#8217; tribute?</h2>



<p>On Sunday, March 3, the 2025 Oscars telecast included the familiar tribute to deceased stars &#8212; and a few others from within the film industry &#8212; who have died over the past year.</p>



<p>The segment used the &#8220;Lacrimosa&#8221; section from Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Requiem in D Minor,&#8221; which is often a tasteful decision.</p>



<p>Late titans of the entertainment industry like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/david-lynch-cause-of-death-iconic-film-director-twin-peaks-creator-passes-away-at-78/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lynch</a>, Dame Maggie Smith, Shelley Duvall, James Earl Jones, Donald Sutherland, and even Gene Hackman &#8212; whose tragic death was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-wife-and-dog-found-dead-in-santa-fe-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered last week</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Michelle Trachtenberg on October 23, 2017." class="wp-image-520482" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_michelletrachtenberg_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Trachtenberg attends the Third Annual &#8220;InStyle Awards&#8221;  presented by InStyle at The Getty Center on October 23, 2017.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for InStyle)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It did seem odd to some viewers that Michelle Trachtenberg did not make the In Memoriam segment.</p>



<p>After all, she had an extensive filmography. Though she died at only 39, she had been a child actress and thus worked for decades.</p>



<p>Certainly, many <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-michelle-trachtenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-list actors knew her</a>. People attending the Oscars had known her for years or even decades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-news-of-michelle-trachtenberg-dying-just-too-last-minute">Was news of Michelle Trachtenberg dying just too last minute?</h2>



<p>News of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/michelle-trachtenberg-final-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Trachtenberg&#8217;s passing</a> broke hours <em>before </em>the discover of Gene Hackman and his wife (and one of their dogs) dead in their Santa Fe home.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that most people are more familiar with Trachtenberg&#8217;s work in things like <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em> and <em>Gossip Girl </em>than in films like <em>Mysterious Skin</em> or <em>Black Christmas</em>. Gene Hackman was famous specifically for his film work.</p>



<p>But many would argue that Alec Baldwin is now more famous for his television work than in film &#8212; but if he passed, he would be unlikely to receive a snub like this.</p>

<p>There were other snubs at the Oscars In Memoriam segment.</p>



<p>One particularly notable one was Tony Todd. Many of us know this actor from his science fiction work, like <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Stargate SG-1</em>, and <em>Babylon 5: A Call To Arms</em>.</p>



<p>But, in addition to these live action television work and to his phenomenal voice acting (he had a <em>very </em>distinctive voice), Todd was perhaps best known for his work in the horror genre. It was strange to many to see him not receive a tribute, even if he worked in a genre that is sometimes disparaged.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-behind-oscars-in-memoriam-snubs">What&#8217;s behind Oscars In Memoriam snubs?</h2>



<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/shannen-doherty-cause-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannen Doherty passed away</a> in the summer of 2024 after an extended battle with cancer.</p>



<p>Like Michelle Trachtenberg and Tony Todd, many associated her more strongly with her television work.</p>



<p>But she was also in <em>Mall Rats</em>, <em>Heathers</em>, and other classic films. Her exclusion from the Oscars In Memoriam felt <em>weird</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Oscars In Memoriam screen on March 2, 2025." class="wp-image-520481" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0303_oscars_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In Memoriam is shown during the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps we should all keep in mind that decisions like the Oscars In Memoriam tribute are deeply political. We don&#8217;t mean in terms of political partisanship, but rather in terms of who receives honors at the Oscars specifically in contrast with who is considered a &#8220;different&#8221; type of actor. </p>



<p>Clearly, Michelle Trachtenberg, Shannen Doherty, and Tony Todd did not fit someone&#8217;s idea of iconic actors. That&#8217;s sad.</p>



<p>But look, if you&#8217;ve ever read what Oscars voters actually think about films, you come to understand the thinking behind these awards. </p>

<p>Hollywood&#8217;s biggest night has come to an end, and as usual, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy Awards</a> delivered plenty of memorable moments.</p>



<p>But as much as we loved the James Bond tribute and the hilarious monologue from first-time host Conan O&#8217;Brien, the winners and their acceptance speeches were the focus of the night.</p>



<p>Several deserving stars took home their very first Oscars, including <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/mikey-madison-fun-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mikey Madison</a>, who headlined the biggest winner of the night, the audacious sex work dramedy <em>Anora</em>.</p>

<p>We knew that Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo would be in attendance at tonight&#8217;s Academy Awards.</p>



<p>After all, they&#8217;re both nominated for their performances in last year&#8217;s adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wicked</a></em>.</p>
