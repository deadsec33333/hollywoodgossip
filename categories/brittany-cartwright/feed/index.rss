<p>Earlier today, we reported on the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jax-taylor-reveals-cocaine-addiction-in-shocking-new-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor has admitted to battling cocaine addiction</a> for most of his adult life.</p>



<p>Anyone who bore witness to Jax&#8217;s chaotic tenure on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> might consider that the least shocking confession of all time.</p>



<p>But the good news is that Jax is now 83 days sober and speaking publicly about his substance abuse issues for the first time.</p>



<p>The bad news, of course, is that in order to get to this point, he had to tear down his marriage, and his wife says  that process was even more horrific than what we saw on screen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-cartwright-says-she-s-skeptical-about-jax-s-sobriety">Brittany Cartwright says she&#8217;s &#8216;skeptical&#8217; about Jax&#8217;s sobriety</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Cartwright filed for divorce from Jax</a> back in August of 2024, and it seems that she has zero regrets about that decision.</p>



<p>She was quick to respond to today&#8217;s confession, revealing that she&#8217;s happy the truth is finally out, but she still has her doubts about Jax&#8217;s ability to turn things around.</p>



<p>Brittany added that Jax is still engaging in &#8220;alarming&#8221; behavior, and she has doubts about his commitment to getting sober.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="735" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1060408298-3-735x1024.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attends the People's Choice Awards 2018 at Barker Hangar on November 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California.

<p>“His behaviors are still alarming, and his treatment plan seems to be the bare minimum,” she told <em><a href="https://people.com/brittany-cartwright-reacts-to-ex-jax-taylor-revealing-his-cocaine-addiction-and-substance-issues-exclusive-11690144">People</a> </em>magazine, addinh that co-parenting her 3-year-old son Cruz with Jax “is still a challenge and very difficult.”</p>



<p>“For the first time, I can speak openly about the extent of trauma he’s instilled on our family over the years,” Brittany said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-difficult-situation-with-tremendously-high-stakes">A difficult situation with tremendously high stakes</h2>



<p>Brittany says she wishes the bast for Jax, but that her top priority is, as always, the health and wellness of her son.</p>



<p>“I’m trying to navigate this as best as I can for my son and I, but every day is still a challenge and very difficult,&#8221; she revealed.</p>



<p>“Jax has caused an enormous amount of damage, and I have very little trust in him at this point,” Cartwright continued. “My only hope is that one day, he will be a better person for his son.”</p>

<p>These days, Jax says he&#8217;s mostly sober, but still “smoke[s] weed a little bit … to go to sleep.”</p>



<p>He admits that he&#8217;s not on good terms with Brittany, explaining, “It changes. One day she’s happy, one day she’s mad. …. I never know what I’m going to get with her.</p>



<p>“I walk on eggshells constantly — as I should,” Taylor  continued. “I just want her to know that I’m really, really trying. I’m doing everything she’s asked.”</p>



<p>Jax has made a lot of mistakes in his life. But here&#8217;s hoping he can make up for lost time &#8212; if not for his sake, then for his kid&#8217;s.</p>

<p>According to Brittany Cartwright, Jax Taylor&#8217;s time in rehab didn&#8217;t change him one bit.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> or the Jax-and-Brittany-based spinoff, <em>The Valley</em>, then you&#8217;re probably aware that Jax sometimes struggles to control his temper.</p>



<p>And by that, we mean he throws more temper tantrums than his three-year-old son.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-didn-t-help-jax-taylor">Brittany Cartwright Says Rehab Didn&#8217;t Help Jax Taylor</h2>



<p>Shortly after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/brittany-cartwright-my-sex-life-with-jax-sucked-before-our-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany separated from Jax </a>earlier in March, he made the decision to try and regulate some of the personal issues that had caused so many problems in his relationships.</p>



<p>Jax checked into rehab and vowed to change for the sake of his wife and son. Sadly, it seems that his efforts fell flat.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/brittany-cartwright-i-am-still-separated-from-jax-taylor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax and Brittany are still separated</a>, and she recently filed for divorce. And in a new interview with Bravo producer Alex Baskin, Brittany says Jax is as angry as ever.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like he changed at all in those 30 days. And the reason, I’m sure it’ll be on the show as well, but, you know, a lot of rage texting and stuff was still going on the entire time that he was in rehab,” she said.</p>



<p>“So, for me, I was just noticing like, this is just going to be constant.</p>



<p>“Like, if you’re in therapy seven hours a day, and you’re still finding time to call me names and cuss me out? And send me rage texts? Then you’re obviously not ever gonna change,&#8221; Brittany continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In the interview, Brittany explained that she decided to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file for divorce while Jax was in rehab </a>so that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to talk her out of it.</p>



<p>“I’m so glad I did, I’m not changing my mind. I’m so happy with this decision,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that Jax&#8217;s actions led her to realize, “This is bad, I can’t stay in this. It was very eye-opening.”</p>

<p>Brittany also spoke about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/brittany-cartwright-hook-up-after-jax-taylor-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hooking up with Jax&#8217;s longtime friend Julian Sensley</a>.</p>



<p>She says the decision was motivated by the fact that “it was somebody that [she] felt [she] knew,” and she “always thought he was so hot.”</p>



<p>“I was just so mad at Jax. I didn’t care if I hurt his feelings like that. Why should I care? [Jax] never cared about how he hurt my feelings for years,&#8221; Brittany explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;He put me down. He did so much to me that, I’m sorry you’re so upset about who it is, but at the same time, you didn’t give me attention, affection or anything for years.</p>

<p>“So, I was like, you know what? This guy is really hot, and I was taking care of myself, and Jax has no legs to stand on. He hooked up with my friend, let’s all remember that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, not only did <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/06/faith-stowers-jax-taylor-needs-to-be-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax hook up with Faith Stowers</a>, he did so while he and Brittany were dating!</p>



<p>So he really has no right to get mad at his ex for what she did after she filed for divorce.</p>



<p>But this is Jax Taylor we&#8217;re talking about. So he&#8217;s probably already thrown multiple tantrums over it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Brittany Cartwright moved on very quickly after her split from Jax Taylor!</p>



<p>A source close to the situation revealed that Brittany hooked up with Jax&#8217;s friend right after their split, according to a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/07/celebrity-news/brittany-cartwright-started-secretly-hooking-up-with-jax-taylors-pal-julian-sensley-shortly-after-separation/">report</a> from <em>Page Six. </em></p>



<p>The insider revealed that shortly after Jax and Brittany broke up in February, the <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>star began a &#8220;casual&#8221; fling with Julian Sensley. Julian is a basketball player-turned-actor, who was a bouncer at the bar TomTom.</p>



<p>After Brittany and Jax separated, the reality star reportedly began a short, &#8220;casual&#8221; physical relationship with Julian. The insider said that Brittany&#8217;s estranged husband &#8220;went beserk,&#8221; when he heard about the fling.</p>

<p>The source also admitted that Brittany&#8217;s romance with Julian was part of Jax&#8217;s reason for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking mental health treatment</a> in July 2024. </p>



<p>Julian is now engaged, and he shares a child with his fiancée. The pair were reportedly &#8220;off and on.&#8221; During the relationship with Brittany, they were &#8220;going through a rough patch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brittany did reveal that they had said that they could see other people in a June <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIrDEpphC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with <em>E! News</em>. &#8220;We’ve said going into this that we could test the waters with other people if we wanted to,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The drama surrounding the relationship will reportedly take part in <em>The Valley </em>season 2. The reality show&#8217;s next season is expected to air in 2025. </p>



<p>Julian also has an older child. An older rumor also romantically linked him to fellow <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>star Lala Kent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-did-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-break-up">When Did Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor Break Up?</h2>



<p>Brittany and Jax have been married since June 2019. They have one child together: <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-welcome-first-child-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cruz Michael Cauchi</a>. The pair seem dedicated to co-parenting Cruz since their split.</p>



<p>Jax had previously cheated on his wife, but it&#8217;s not clear if that played a part in the split.</p>



<p>They separated in February 2024. Brittany announced the separation on their podcast <em>When Reality Hits</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since the split, there have been a few times that people believed that they had reunited. The pair have remained separated since the split. In June, Brittany assured fans that they were still separated in the above-mentioned<em> </em>interview with <em>E! </em>She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially filed for divorce </a>in August 2024. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-have-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-said-about-the-split">What Have Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor Said About the Split?</h2>



<p>After filing for divorce, Brittany <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/brittany-cartwright-breaks-silence-on-jax-taylor-divorce-breaks-all-the-way-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened up about how difficult</a> the process has been on the <em>When Reality Hits </em>podcast. Still, she said that she was looking forward to the future.</p>



<p>&#8220;My decision to file wasn’t made lightly or quickly. It’s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I gained enough courage and strength to do what’s best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>While a divorce is undoubtedly difficult, Jax admitted that he felt that it was the right decision. He showed support for his ex on a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-breaks-silence-on-brittany-cartwright-divorce-she-made-the-right-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate episode</a> of the podcast. &#8220;Brittany did file for divorce. I understand why she did and I agree that this is the right decision for our family,&#8221; he explained. </p>



<p>Jax seemed to own up to his own shortcomings, as he continued. &#8220;I don’t blame her at all. I mean, I can’t believe she’s been with me this long as it is. That we stayed, to be honest,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Brittany Cartwright is moving on with her life.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s easy.</p>



<p>As previously detailed, the Bravo personality has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">filed for divorce from Jax Taylor</a> after about five years of marriage.</p>



<p>She did so a few months after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/brittany-cartwright-i-am-still-separated-from-jax-taylor/">the couple separated</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1013" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-1024x1013.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508314" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-1024x1013.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-300x297.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-80x80.jpg 80w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-768x760.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-2048x2026.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-960x950.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-1080x1068.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1477303698-1200x1187.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards at Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on March 27, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for iHeartRadio)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s been a big week,” Cartwright admitted on the August 30 episode of her and Jax’s joint podcast, “When Reality Hits,&#8221; marking the first time she has commented on the legal split.</p>



<p>As a dedicated reality star, Cartwright then teased the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-valley-season-2/">The Valley Season 2</a>:</p>



<p>“I unfortunately can’t speak to details since everything has been heavily documented on the show since we happen to be filming right now. </p>



<p>&#8220;You will see how everything plays out once the show airs, but I will say this: This season has been the most difficult season I have ever had to film.”</p>

<p>Cartwright and Taylor have had their relationship filmed in front of the cameras, but the former says it&#8217;s still been a challenge to see such a private matter play out in public:</p>



<p>“I never imagined I’d go through something so personal and painful while having the world watch. I’m not saying this for anyone to feel badly, but I know that this is the life I chose and I’m so fortunate in many ways. I always want to be real with y’all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taylor previously cheated on Cartwright, but the pair worked it out.</p>



<p>This time around, we can&#8217;t say for certain <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/did-jax-taylor-cheat-on-brittany-cartwright-again/">whether or not infidelity played</a> a role in the divorce.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-682x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508316" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1150186188-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend 4th Annual World Dog Day at West Hollywood Park on May 18, 2019 in West Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One thing is for certain, Brittany emphasized on this podcast: The divorce is NOT a publicity stunt.</p>



<p>“My decision to file wasn’t made lightly or quickly. It’s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I gained enough courage and strength to do what’s best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth,” she said. </p>



<p>“It’s been very difficult, but I’m stronger than ever … my motivation is my son, my Cruzie, who deserves a happy and healthy mommy. </p>



<p>&#8220;Moving forward, Jax and I will be doing the podcast separately.”</p>



<p>Cartwright and Taylor got married in 2019 and share three-year old son Cruz.</p>

<p>For his part, Taylor talked about the separation with Us Weekly in March, denying any talk of sleeping around as follows: </p>



<p>“I want people to know that it is possible to coparent and run businesses and be okay with each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not everybody just gets divorced because they cheated. Believe it or not, that was not the case. I know it’s shocking. We’re just not communicating right now and that’s all there is to it&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re taking some time for ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fear not: your favorite <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/jax-taylor-reportedly-melting-down-following-bravo-firing-will-v/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced Bravolebrities</a> will return, as <em>The Valley</em> has been officially renewed for a second season.</p>



<p>But while season one focused on the seemingly “normal” lives of former big stars living the suburban life, season 2 of <em>The Valley</em> will see a return to the dramatic form set by the show’s predecessor, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>And we have all the details. From casting news to initial spoilers from filming, here’s everything you need to know about what’s next for <em>The Valley.</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="707" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156-1024x707.jpg" alt="Season 2 cast of The Valley will include Lala Kent, Kristen Doute, Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor" class="wp-image-508108" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156-300x207.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156-768x530.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156-960x662.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156-1080x745.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1166707156.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Lala Kent, James Mae, Co-Founder Kristen Doute, Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor attend The Garage Sale featuring James Mae and Friend presented by Good Times at Davey Wayne&#8217;s on August 07, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for James Mae )</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-valley-season-2-cast-who-s-returning"><br>&#8216;The Valley&#8217; Season 2 Cast: Who&#8217;s Returning?</h2>



<p><br>Season 2 of <em>The Valley</em> promises to be just as electrifying as season 1, with a lineup of returning cast members that may actually surprise some people, given the recent news. </p>



<p><br>All of the OG couples will be back in the action: Danny and Mia, Jason and Janet, and even Jesse and Michelle, who split last season and are currently navigating the hardships of co-parenting.</p>



<p><br>Then there’s&nbsp; Kristin Doute and her boyfriend Luke Broderick. No doubt the show will explore her heartbreaking pregnancy loss and fill viewers in on how serious this relationship is getting.</p>



<p><br>There have also been fan reports that VPR guest stars Scheana Shay and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/lala-kent-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="330">Lala Kent are poised to return,</a> having been spotted filming with Bravo cameras while their usual day job is on hiatus.</p>

You&#8217;ve seen them together&#8230;</p>



<p>Now, you&#8217;re going to see them DIVORCED!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-and-jax-s-divorce-a-shocking-twist-or-totally-expected"><br>Brittany and Jax’s Divorce: A Shocking Twist Or Totally Expected?</h2>



<p><br>In a dramatic turn of events &#8211; or, you know, maybe not, given their track record &#8211;  Brittany and Jax, the show’s most talked-about personalities, announced their divorce in August. </p>



<p>They pair were right in the middle of shooting season 2 when the news was blasted far and wide by the media.</p>



<p>However, while the official announcement didn’t come until the end of summer, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the divorce</a> was filed by Brittany in January. Which means all the while these two have been filming, they&#8217;ve been navigating this split.</p>



<p>And isn&#8217;t that what reality TV is all about! </p>



<p>The split comes after a 5 year tumultuous marriage, to say the least, and Jax’s recent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-to-leave-rehab-make-emotional-return-to-the-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stint in rehab</a>.</p>



<p>No doubt the pair revealing raw and personal details about their deteriorating marriage will be the primary focus of season 2. Although, if we’re being totally honest, wasn’t it already the focus of season 1 as well?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kristen Doute" class="wp-image-508110" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-728x546.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-480x360.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-960x720.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75-1080x810.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-75.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kristen Doute sharing secrets in her confessional on The Valley, season one. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo/Youtube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-season-1-finale-recap-what-happened"><br><strong>Season 1 Finale Recap: What Happened?</strong></h2>



<p><br>In the Season 1 finale of <em>The Valley</em>, tensions soared between Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright, before it seemed like the pair had made peace. </p>



<p>“This is such an amazing moment for me. I think we beat the odds when it comes to opening a bar with a partner or significant other. I think this is the one thing keeping Brittany and I together,” Jax said in a confessional. “Right now, the future is looking pretty bright.”</p>



<p>By the end of the episode, a post-production snippet confirmed their separation.  Whomp. </p>



<p>But shockingly, theirs wasn&#8217;t the only relationship to crash and burn on the reality show. </p>



<p>By the finale, it was clear that Jesse and Michelle were not doing well. </p>



<p>“I’m being honest that I lost a lot of those feelings for you,” Michelle&nbsp;actually says at one point right to Jesse&#8217;s face. In the same post-production wrap up, viewers learned that Michelle told Jesse their marriage was over three days after filming wrapped. Jesse told the cameras he “felt blindsided and blind.”</p>



<p>But in her confessional, Michelle insisted, “There is no question if I made the right choice.” </p>



<p>Season 2 will most likely not only focus on the divorce between Jax and Brittany, but how Jesse and Michelle will navigate co-parenting their daughter, Isabella. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-1024x768.jpg" alt="Brittany Cartwright's divorce and season 2 details revealed" class="wp-image-508111" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-728x546.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-480x360.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-960x720.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73-1080x810.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-73.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brittany Cartwright sharing her truth during the first season of The Valley. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Youtube/Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-will-season-2-air"><br>When Will Season 2 Air?</h2>



<p><br>As for when fans can expect to dive back into the world of <em>The Valley</em>, an exact premiere date hasn’t been confirmed yet. However, given that it&#8217;s already in production, a release date of early 2025 wouldn&#8217;t be crazy. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll keep an eye on the show’s official channels for the precise air date and update when we can!</p>



<p>On things for sure, Season 2 is shaping up to be an unforgettable continuation of the show!</p>

<p>Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright are officially heading for a divorce. </p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s what fans have been hearing for years &#8211; but now, it&#8217;s true. </p>



<p>After five years of marriage, former <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> star Brittany Cartwright revealed she has filed for a divorce from husband Jax Taylor and that they are no longer living together.</p>



<p>Honestly, when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-married/">Jax and Brittany got married</a> in 2019, fans were skeptical it would last the year.</p>



<p>Still, it&#8217;s sad to see a chapter close. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-amp-brittany-cartwright-s-divorce-official">Jax Taylor &amp; Brittany Cartwright&#8217;s Divorce Official</h2>



<p>Brittany Cartwright officially filed for divorce from Jax Taylor just before Labor Day in 2024. </p>



<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/27/celebrity-news/brittany-cartwright-files-for-divorce-from-jax-taylor-after-5-years-of-marriage/?utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pagesix_news_alert&amp;utm_content=20240827?&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;lctg=656f618a1d32ee5cab058641&amp;utm_term=P6%20-%20News%20Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Court documents</a> filed Tuesday August 26 in Los Angeles  show that “The Valley” star filed for the dissolution of marriage with a minor child, according to<em> Page Six.</em> </p>



<p>She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and the date of separation as Jan. 24, 2024, a day before her birthday.</p>



<p>Brittany initially announced the separation on their joint podcast <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/when-reality-hits-with-jax-and-brittany/id1678330734?i=1000647572424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When Reality Hits</a></em> back in February. </p>



<p>&#8220;Many of you guys have been asking me about Jax and I and our relationship,&#8221; she shared during the Feb. 29 episode. &#8220;I just think it&#8217;s important to be real and honest with you guys because we&#8217;ve shared so much of our lives with you guys.&#8221;</p>



<p>But why? What has changed between the pair? Brittany answers that too. </p>



<p>&#8220;On my last podcast I alluded to many marriages go through rocky times,&#8221; Brittany, who shares 2-year-old son&nbsp;<strong>Cruz</strong>&nbsp;with Jax, continued. &#8220;Yes, marriages in general are very hard and I&#8217;ve had a particularly rough year this past year. Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moving out? A rough year? Something tells us the <em>Vandepump</em> spinoff, <em>The Valley,</em> which will star Jax and Brittany just got a whole lot more interesting! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-amp-brittany-cartwright-swore-divorce-would-not-happen-happen">Jax Taylor &amp; Brittany Cartwright Swore Divorce Would Not Happen Happen!</h2>



<p>“We would never get divorced, we don’t believe in that. Not sure [why] people are saying that.&#8221;</p>



<p>This was the response Jax gave to a commenter on Instagram back in December 2022. He has so far not made a statement about his split from Brittany after the news of the paper being filed. </p>



<p>In the docs, Brittany asked the judge to waive spousal support for her and Jax. She is also seeking joint custody of their 3-year-old son Cruz, with her ex getting visitation rights.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-signs-were-all-there">The Signs Were All There</h2>



<p>Prior to Jax&#8217;s comment above, Brittany hadn&#8217;t appeared on Jax&#8217;s Instagram page since July, which is sort of strange, considering the fact that dude posts constantly.</p>



<p>Then, out of the blue, the the happy couple were all smiles in a photo of them  at a People&#8217;s Choice Awards after party.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment on the sudden reappearance of Brittany, with many taking it as a sign that the divorce rumors were bogus.</p>



<p>“You two look incredible together! Please tell me the divorce rumors are false! You belong together [red heart emoji],&#8221; one person wrote. And Jax responded with the above &#8212; and he&#8217;s kept saying they&#8217;re good ever since. </p>

<p>A month after that award show, the duo&#8217;s talked about their marriage on their podcast,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/when-reality-hits-with-jax-and-brittany/id1678330734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When Reality Hits with Jax &amp; Brittany</a></em>.</p>



<p>They were quick to insist that they were making things work in their marriage and that they would continue to do so.</p>



<p>Because there was no other choice. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">&#8220;We would always hear when we got married, people were like, &#8216;They&#8217;ll be together for one year,&#8217; or whatever. Now we&#8217;ve been together for eight years, almost married for four. We&#8217;re trucking through,&#8221; Brittany said on the podcast. </p>



<p>Jax took things a step further. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in divorce. My parents didn&#8217;t get divorced,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in that. Marriage is work.&#8221;</p>

<p>He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying every day is amazing&#8230;There&#8217;s good days and there&#8217;s bad days, but that&#8217;s marriage, and that&#8217;s what makes your relationship stronger. We love hard. We fight hard. It&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before they got<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/12/jax-taylor-reportedly-melting-down-following-bravo-firing-will-v/"> fired from <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> for being racist</a>, these two delivered non-stop drama as they careened toward the altar.</p>



<p>After all, Jax had been caught cheating on Brittany several times, most memorably with Faith Stowers.</p>



<p>Jax was later fired after it was revealed that he conspired with Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute to have Faith arrested for crimes she didn&#8217;t commit.</p>



<p>Like we said &#8212; there&#8217;s messy, and then there&#8217;s Jax Taylor!</p>

<p>But their divorce isn&#8217;t even the messiest thing happening in the lives of Brittany and Jax right now. </p>



<p>For one thing, Jax spent most of his summer in an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-to-leave-rehab-make-emotional-return-to-the-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-patient rehab center</a>. He checked in late July and just about a week before the divorce announcement, he was released. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0">&#8220;Jax has spent the last 30 days in treatment and will be heading back home later this week,” a representative for<em> The Valley </em>star confirmed to PEOPLE on Monday, Aug. 19.  “It’s been an emotional month for him and he’s most looking forward to spending time with his son.” </p>



<p>Speaking of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/vanderpump-rules-spinoff-confirmed-who-will-star-on-the-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Valley</a></em> &#8211; the hit spin-off of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> has been greenlit for another season. In fact, as we understand it, the show is in production right now. </p>



<p>AND BOTH BRITTANY AND JAX SHOULD BE RETURNING. </p>





<p>Yeah, this won&#8217;t be awkward at ALL!</p>

<p>Is Jax Taylor keeping the money that was supposed to go to a cancer charity?</p>



<p>Because fans had a <em>very </em>different impression.</p>



<p>In early 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright split</a>. And the apparent end of their marriage did not end their drama.</p>



<p>With <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/vanderpump-rules-season-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on hiatus</a>, their <em>mess </em>is spilling over onto social media. That includes the accusation that Jax is pocketing money that was supposed to go to charity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-jax-taylor-keeping-the-money-that-he-makes-on-cameo">Is Jax Taylor keeping the money that he makes on Cameo?</h2>



<p>On Saturday, August 10, Brittany Cartwright took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brittany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story to accuse her estranged husband, Jax Taylor, of some seriously underhanded dealings.</p>



<p>Originally, Jax assured fans that money that they paid him through Cameo would then become charitable donations. Specifically, he said that at least a portion of his earnings would go to esophageal cancer research.</p>



<p>Cameo is a customized-video app that celebrities of all echelons of fame can use. Fans order a short video &#8212; sometimes as a gag gift or a birthday present or simply for themselves &#8212; and a famous person spends 30 seconds or so talking into their phone. An industrious Cameo creator can make thousands of dollars a day doing this.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright in September of 2019." class="wp-image-507062" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/0813_jaxtaylor_brittanycartwright_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor (L) and Brittany Cartwright attend âA Ride Through the Agesâ: Wrangler Capsule Collection Launch at Fred Segal Sunset at Fred Segal on September 19, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Erik Voake/Getty Images for Wrangler)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Brittany Cartwright, Jax has not followed through on his charitable Cameo vow.</p>



<p>She fired off her accusation on her Story, alleging that he has not paid forward even &#8220;a dime&#8221; of those earnings.</p>



<p>Jax&#8217;s father passed away in 2017 after a battle with esophageal cancer. Brittany&#8217;s allegation really cuts to the heart of his character as a person &#8230; and also signals that she&#8217;s not holding back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-has-used-the-valley-to-promote-his-cameo-side-hustle">Jax has used &#8216;The Valley&#8217; to promote his Cameo side hustle</h2>



<p>As <em>The Valley</em> viewers can attest, Jax Taylor used the series premiere to very performatively sit down with his laptop and pour through his Cameo requests.</p>



<p>This served as both an advertisement for his Cameo services <em>and </em>a way to boost his image on the show. He&#8217;s essentially showing off how many people are willing to pay for him to make a short custom video.</p>



<p>Not all reality shows would allow one of the cast to plug themselves in such a crass manner. But you have to admit that it fits well with Jax&#8217;s brand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.cameo.com/mrjaxtaylor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor&#8217;s Cameo</a> account no longer shows that original introductory video &#8212; the one with the vow to donate to cancer research.</p>



<p>His new introduction simply sings his own praises and lists reasons for might buy one &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a birthday message, a friendly roast, or an offer of advice. (<em>Who </em>is getting life advice from Jax?)</p>



<p>Oh, and there&#8217;s also the price. The starting ask for a Jax Taylor Cameo is $128. And according to his ex, Jax Taylor is keeping that money for himself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-valley-is-filming-season-2">&#8216;The Valley&#8217; is filming Season 2</h2>



<p>Even with <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> on hiatus &#8212; but don&#8217;t worry; more is coming &#8212; the messy and chaotic lives of the Bravolebrities go on.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll get to see a good portion of that on <em>The Valley</em> Season 2.</p>



<p>One does have to wonder if Jax Taylor will keep promoting his Cameo. With his estranged wife calling him out, <em>less </em>attention might better serve him.</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is taking steps to protect his mental health amid the breakdown of his marriage.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax and wife Brittany Cartwright separated</a> back in February after nearly five years of marriage.</p>



<p>Now, reps for Jax have confirmed that the troubled reality star will be checking into a facility to receive treatment for his mental health.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-takes-decisive-step-to-safeguard-mental-health">Jax Taylor Takes Decisive Step to Safeguard Mental Health</h2>



<p>“Jax has always been candid about his mental health struggles, especially during the past few months on his podcast. He has made the decision to seek in-patient treatment,” a rep for Jax told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/30/entertainment/jax-taylor-seeks-in-patient-treatment-for-mental-health-struggles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> this week.</p>



<p>“This is a particularly sensitive time for him and his family. They ask for privacy and respect until he is ready to speak more on this matter.”</p>

<p>The news comes just weeks after Jax revealed that he was working with a new therapist in an effort to curtail his &#8220;serious anger issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I met a doctor at my bar, and she’s absolutely amazing. And I went in there, and I literally just broke down,” he explained.</p>



<p>“I’m like, ‘This is what’s wrong with me, and this is what I’m doing, and this is who l’m attacking. And I have serious, serious anger issues, and I have a child and I don’t want him to see me act like that.&#8217;”</p>

<p>Jax hasn&#8217;t offered any specifics about when and where his in-patient treatment will take place.</p>



<p>But it seems that his self-reported anger issues are still at the top of his priority list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-and-brittany-are-still-separated">Jax and Brittany Are Still Separated</h2>



<p>Despite reports that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-back-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax and Brittany had gotten back together</a>, the stars of Bravo&#8217;s <em>The Valley</em> are still living separately.</p>



<p>They revealed on a recent podcast episode that they&#8217;re trying to “exhaust everything else” before choosing divorce.</p>

<p>“We’re trying to live separately, we’re trying to possibly date other people, [and] we’re trying to, you know, figure out what works for us,&#8221; Jax said at the time.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, fans learned that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jax-taylor-steps-out-with-new-girlfriend-paige-woolen-amid-brittany-cartwright-separation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax was dating a model named Paige Woolen</a>.</p>



<p>Jax has repeatedly denied rumors that he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/did-jax-taylor-cheat-on-brittany-cartwright-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheated on Brittany</a> with Woolen or anyone else.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1175832580-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor attends âA Ride Through the Agesâ: Wrangler Capsule Collection Launch at Fred Segal Sunset at Fred Segal on September 19, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>Of course, Jax was caught being unfaithful in a storyline on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>. </p>



<p>But as he often points out, that indiscretion happened before he and Brittany got married.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess what will happen next in this turbulent relationship.</p>



<p>But we wish Jax Taylor all the best as he continues his mental health journey.</p>

<p>Brittany Cartwright would like to set her romantic record straight.</p>



<p>As you are very likely aware, the Bravo personality announced in February that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">she had split from Jax Taylor</a>, her husband of four years.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health,&#8221; Cartwright explained at the time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="993" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-993x1024.jpg" alt="Brittany Cartwright on a red carpet" class="wp-image-501321" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-993x1024.jpg 993w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-291x300.jpg 291w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-768x792.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-1986x2048.jpg 1986w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-931x960.jpg 931w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-1047x1080.jpg 1047w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151024724-1163x1200.jpg 1163w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brittany Cartwright attends &#8220;The GOAT&#8221; Los Angeles Tastemaker Event at Ysabel on April 30, 2024 in West Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Anna Webber/Getty Images for Prime Video)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On Tuesday night&#8217;s season finale of The Valley, viewers went behind the scenes of this decision to some extent, witnessing a blowout between the estranged spouses.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not just gonna get away with the way you&#8217;ve treated me for all these years,&#8221; Cartwright said to Taylor at one point on this episode.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Brittany&#8217;s friends said Jax had referred to her as &#8220;fat&#8221; and said she was &#8220;lazy&#8221; and mocked her for not having any friends in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jax has been saying that he&#8217;s gonna go to therapy for years now,&#8221; the 35-year-old added in a confessional. &#8220;The day before we pick cameras back up, he all of a sudden has an appointment to go see the doctor. This is all a front. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is what he wants everyone to see and believe that he&#8217;s actually gonna do these things to change. I bet you money he will not do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, Taylor later admitted he did not go to therapy.</p>



<p>The thing is, this finale was filmed many months ago.</p>



<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-back-together/">Taylor has hinted that the couple wasn&#8217;t really breaking up</a>.</p>



<p>So, where do things stand at the moment? Cartwright opened up about her marital status in a new interview with E! News.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="734" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-734x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-501323" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-215x300.jpg 215w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-768x1071.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-1468x2048.jpg 1468w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-688x960.jpg 688w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-774x1080.jpg 774w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-860x1200.jpg 860w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1175832475-scaled.jpg 1835w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend âA Ride Through the Agesâ: Wrangler Capsule Collection Launch at Fred Segal Sunset at Fred Segal on September 19, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Erik Voake/Getty Images for Wrangler)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely still separated,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIrDEpphC0">Cartwright now tells E!</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;ve said going into this that we could test the waters with other people if we wanted to.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jax-taylor-steps-out-with-new-girlfriend-paige-woolen-amid-brittany-cartwright-separation/">Taylor <em>did</em> step out with his rumored new girlfriend</a>.</p>



<p>Cartwright, it should be noted, was not wearing her wedding ring during the interview.</p>



<p>She she knows the decision to see other people &#8220;seems weird and might be crazy to a lot of people,&#8221; but emphasizes she was &#8220;pushed&#8221; to make the choice to walk away&#8230; at least for now.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-1024x684.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright photograph" class="wp-image-501324" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-2048x1369.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-960x642.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-1080x722.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-875701744-1200x802.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend the Global Non Profit F Cancer L.A. Event at Create Nightclub with Dj Kap Slap on November 17, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for FCancer)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Cartwright also told E! she wants Jax to &#8220;focus on his mental health,&#8221; adding that while she was right he wouldn&#8217;t see a psychologist, he&#8217;s currently &#8220;working on himself in different ways.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is a much more sympathetic tone than the one Brittany struck on The Valley finale.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been cheated on, I&#8217;ve been disrespected. I&#8217;ve been humiliated,&#8221; she said via confessional of what her relationship has been like over the years.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have been through a lot of pain in this relationship. It&#8217;s been very public, the pain I&#8217;ve had to deal with. I can&#8217;t deal with it anymore. I&#8217;ve come into my own. I make a lot of money and I just feel like I have woken up.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel so much stronger now, I know I&#8217;ll be okay. I know my worth and I know I do not deserve to be in a relationship like this. What was I thinking staying with him this long?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jax Taylor might be dating a model named Paige Woolen. And he wants the whole world to know it!</p>



<p>As we&#8217;ve previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax and wife Brittany Cartwright separated</a> in February after four years of marriage.</p>



<p>At first, fans were quick to dismiss the announcement as a publicity stunt.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend âA Ride Through the Agesâ: Wrangler Capsule Collection Launch at Fred Segal Sunset at Fred Segal on September 19, 2019 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-500761" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1175832469-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attend âA Ride Through the Agesâ: Wrangler Capsule Collection Launch at Fred Segal Sunset at Fred Segal on September 19, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Erik Voake/Getty Images for Wrangler)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>After all, it coincided perfectly with the premiere of the couple&#8217;s Bravo reality show, <em>The Valley</em>.</p>



<p>But now it looks as though Jax and Brittany are on the verge of calling it quits for good.</p>



<p>And Jax may have put the nail in the coffin by publicly stepping out with his new love interest.</p>

<p>Paige Woolen is a model with nearly 850,000 followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/paigeuncaged/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>And that number is likely to skyrocket now that she appears to be dating one of the most infamous reality stars in recent memory.</p>



<p>As<em> <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/05/27/entertainment/jax-taylors-new-fling-jokingly-says-shes-pregnant-at-birthday-party-for-ariana-madixs-brother/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> </em>reports, Jax and Paige seemed to spend a lot of time together over Memorial Day Weekend. </p>



<p>On Friday, they grabbed lunch in Sherman Oaks, California. And on Saturday, they attended a birthday party for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/ariana-madix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana Madix</a>&#8216;s brother, Jeremy.</p>

<p>Paige reportedly seemed right at home among Jax&#8217;s friends, and at one point, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7edj1ZMBKR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she joked</a>, “And I’m pregnant!” while on camera. At least we <em>think</em> it was a joke&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-throws-some-shade-at-jax">Brittany Throws Some Shade at Jax</h2>



<p>Not to be outdone, Brittany also had an eventful weekend on social media.</p>



<p>She raised some eyebrows by posting an Instagram Reel in which an unidentified woman reacts in shock to a scene from <em>The Valley</em> in which <a href="https://www.instagram.com/youknownat/reel/C7c5e-xNxjK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax berates Brittany for getting sick</a>.</p>

<p>“Like, this is his show that’s supposed to be about his bar and his community and his friends, and he brought his family onto this show, and this is what he’s doing to her?&#8221; said the woman in the video.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like, he’s choosing to present her in that kind of light and to treat her like that. This is what he’s doing to her in front of everybody.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, &amp; just imagine what I’ve been through behind closed doors,” Brittany captioned the clip.</p>

<p>The specifics about what caused the split are still somewhat unclear. But during an appearance on <em>Watch What Happens Live</em> in April, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/brittany-cartwright-my-sex-life-with-jax-sucked-before-our-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany revealed that a “horrible fight”</a> led her to call it quits with Jax.</p>



<p>“It was like a veil was lifted, and I noticed everything wrong,” she said at the time. “They always say a woman can hit her breaking point, and it’s hard to come back from that.”</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know if Jax Taylor and Paige Woolen are actually dating. But hopefully, the model is listening to Brittany&#8217;s story and keeping her eye out for red flags!</p>
