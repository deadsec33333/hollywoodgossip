<p>Where is Amy Winehouse’s husband today? It’s a question many fans are asking following the release of the singer’s biopic, “Back to Black.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/a/pigeons/blake-amy-winehouse-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy and Blake Fielder-Civil first met</a> at a pub in 2005, before getting married on a whim during a trip to Miami, Florida in 2007. Unfortunately, the marriage fizzled out after just two years. Amy and Blake were divorced in 2009. The tumultuous relationship is now a focus in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/04/amy-winehouse-documentary-trailer-released-heartbreaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Back to Black,&#8221; the latest biopic</a> about the late singer. </p>



<p>Thirteen years after <a href="https://people.com/amy-winehouse-death-what-to-know-7502029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy&#8217;s tragic fatal </a>alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011, Blake, now 42 and a father of two, has managed to move on. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-fielder-civil-s-post-amy-winehouse-love-life">Blake Fielder-Civil&#8217;s Post-Amy Winehouse Love Life</h2>



<p>Blake met his next partner, Sarah Aspin, while they were in rehab together in late 2009. The pair had a son together, Jack, in May 2011, making Blake a father. They later welcomed a second child, daughter Lola Jade, in April 2013. </p>



<p>Blake and Sarah were <a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/a60717682/amy-winehouse-husband-blake-fielder-civil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly married and divorced</a>, though actual dates have been kept private making it difficult to piece together a timeline of their relationship. </p>



<p>In August 2012, one year after Amy&#8217;s untimely death, Blake was found choking in bed by Sarah, as originally reported by <em>The Guardian.</em> Blake was <a href="https://theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/09/amy-winehouse-ex-husband-coma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put in a medically induced </a>coma after suffering multiple organ failure. </p>



<p>At the time, Sarah alleged that Blake must have ingested an &#8220;illicit&#8221; substance during a night out drinking with friends. </p>



<p>Thankfully, Blake recovered from the terrifying incident and claimed he has been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sober &#8220;for years&#8221;</a> as recently as April 2024.</p>



<p>As for romantic relationships, Amy&#8217;s ex-husband was reported to be <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3345659/amy-winehouses-ex-blake-fielder-civil-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engaged once again</a>, this time to singer Bay Wright in June 2021. It is unclear if the couple are still together or if they ever ended up tying the knot. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-fielder-civil-still-fond-of-amy-winehouse">Blake Fielder-Civil Still Fond of Amy Winehouse</h2>



<p>One thing Blake hasn&#8217;t kept from the public is how he feels about his late ex-wife, Amy, and their on-again/off-again relationship. </p>



<p>&#8220;I loved Amy very much and she loved me too,&#8221; he told <em>Good Morning Britain </em>while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holding back tears</a> during a live interview in April 2024. &#8220;If there was anything that could bring her back&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Blake has also admitted that he would always &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNQQ5x0v1_I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carry a burden of guilt</a>&#8221; for allegedly introducing Amy to drugs during their headline-making relationship. </p>



<p>&#8220;For me, personally, I’ve needed to stop carrying that cross on my own,&#8221; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/amy-winehouse-death-blake-fielder-civil-b2411321.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake told host Ben Shephard</a> in September 2023. &#8220;I’ve carried that burden myself for over 10 years.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added, &#8220;I was a twenty-something-year-old drug addict. So I had absolutely no idea how to make myself clean, let alone somebody else who was a big cog in a machine for a record label, and there were vested interests in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/amy-winehouse-5-quotes-to-remember-her-by/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy carrying on performing</a>.&#8221; </p>



<p>As for having a relationship with any of Amy&#8217;s family, Blake has made it very clear he <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would like to make amends</a> with them — especially the late singer&#8217;s father, Mitch Winehouse. </p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to be best friends but I wouldn&#8217;t mind having a conversation,&#8221; Blake said in April 2024. It is yet to be seen if Mitch, or any of the Winehouse family, will take her ex-husband up on his offer. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="645" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-74387229-645x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-500183" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-74387229-645x1024.jpg 645w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-74387229-189x300.jpg 189w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-74387229-605x960.jpg 605w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-74387229-680x1080.jpg 680w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-74387229.jpg 756w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Amy Winehouse and  Blake Fielder-Civil arrive to the 2007 MTV Movie Awards held at the Gibson Amphitheatre on June 3, 2007 in Universal City, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frederick M.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-for-amy-winehouse-s-4-million-estate">The Fight for Amy Winehouse&#8217;s $4 Million Estate </h2>



<p>When Amy died unexpectedly in 2011, she was worth an estimated $4 million. Her sophomore album, also titled &#8220;Back to Black,&#8221; went double platinum in under a year. Unfortunately, at 27 years old, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/1887612/amy-winehouse-fortune-who-inherited-after-singer-died" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy did not have a will</a> set up for her newfound fame and fortune. </p>



<p>Per British law, a person&#8217;s inheritance is distributed among their parents, spouse and children. Amy and Blake&#8217;s divorced two years prior to her death and did not have any children together, which left Amy&#8217;s father, Mitch Winehouse, as the estate&#8217;s sole inheritor. </p>



<p>However, Blake <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amy-winehouse-blake-fielder-civil-lawsuit-estate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a $1.4 million lawsuit</a> against Mitch demanding not only a lump sum payout but also a monthly allowance, according to <em>Fox News</em>. Blake claimed he had a right to the money because he was with Amy for six years, including their marriage from 2007 to 2009, during which her music made her an international celebrity. </p>



<p>The lawsuit was unsuccessful. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amy-winehouse-s-ex-husband-defends-new-biopic">Amy Winehouse&#8217;s Ex-Husband Defends New Biopic</h2>



<p>Blake recently revealed that he has watched &#8220;Back to Black,&#8221; directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. Despite reviews suggesting the film gave a &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; portrayal to Amy&#8217;s ex, Blake disagrees.</p>



<p>In fact, he <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/amy-winehouse-blake-fielder-civil-gmb-back-to-black-b2527611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called the viewing experience</a> &#8220;therapeutic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not in a sense of being let off the hook or whitewashed, as [has] been alluded to,&#8221; Blake told Good Morning Britain, &#8220;just in a sense of it wasn’t all about addiction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jack O&#8217;Connell, the actor who plays Blake on screen, has also spoken out to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/back-black-amy-winehouse-biopic-movie-2024-jack-oconnell-blake-fielder-civil-mitch-winehouse-1900996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defend his portrayal </a>of the former producer. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&nbsp;think it&#8217;s a very easy narrative to spin. Just to point to one baddie and boo him and just f&#8211;king tear him apart publicly,&#8221; the British actor told Newsweek. </p>

<p>Amy Winehouse&#8217;s last known photos have been making the rounds on social media this week.</p>



<p>And some fans are not happy about it.</p>





<p>The <a href="https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/amy-winehouse/final-performance-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial images</a> &#8212; which have been reposted by Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts big and small &#8212; were taken during the music icon&#8217;s final performance.</p>

<p>The concert took place in Belgrade, Serbia in 2011, just five days before <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/04/amy-winehouse-documentary-trailer-released-heartbreaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy&#8217;s tragic death at the age of 27</a>.</p>



<p>Amy was struggling courageously against the eating disorder and substance abuse issues that would soon claim her life.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, she felt obligated to continue with her grueling performance schedule at a time when she should have been receiving help.</p>

<p>Amy slurred her words and forgot the lyrics to several songs during that last concert.</p>



<p>At one point, she reacted to jeers from the crowd by crying and hugging herself.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the photos and footage from Amy&#8217;s final performance are heartbreaking.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve resurfaced due to a renewed interest in Amy&#8217;s tremendous talent and tragically short life.</p>



<p>That interest seems to have been sparked by the upcoming biopic, <em>Back to Black</em>.</p>



<p>Perhaps such a project was inevitable. But fans feel that Amy deserved a better tribute than this film, which is being derided as derivative and exploitative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-back-to-black-why-is-the-amy-winehouse-biopic-receiving-such-harsh-criticism">Back to Black: Why Is the Amy Winehouse Biopic Receiving Such Harsh Criticism?</h2>

<p>The film doesn&#8217;t hit US theaters until May 17, but already <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/back_to_black" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critics have not been kind</a>.</p>



<p>Worse, at least one close associate of Amy&#8217;s has blasted the film as an inaccurate representation of her life.</p>



<p>Her friend Tyler James stated flat out that Amy would not have appreciated the movie. </p>



<p>Although he conceded that she would have appreciated its sympathetic portrayal of Blake Fielder-Civil to whom she was briefly married.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy would have been pleased for Blake [because of his sympathetic portrayal], but she wouldn&#8217;t have liked the film,&#8221; James recently told <em><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/amy-winehouse-back-to-black-film-tyler-james-qx6gwgs95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times of London</a></em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is this sense of Amy being coherent even when taking drugs, but there was so much suffering.&#8221;</p>



<p>James added that the film &#8220;avoids the uncomfortable&#8221; and &#8220;focuses way too much on Blake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needless to say, it sounds as though fans of Amy&#8217;s might not be thrilled with director Sam Taylor-Johnson&#8217;s take on the music icon&#8217;s short life.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Tragically, of course, the artist is not around to celebrate this occasion.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/07/amy-winehouse-dead-found-in-london-home/">Winehouse died of a drug overdose</a> in July of 2011.</p>
<p>But Adele took a moment on Wednesday morning to recognize the late singer,&nbsp;sharing a photo of the beloved icon standing in front of a muted pink wall, donning a black fur jacket and rocking a giant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday Amy X,&rdquo; Adele simply captioned the image.</p>
<p>See it for yourself below:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Adele and Winehouse are both British, of course, although the former&#8217;s affection for the latter clearly runs deeper than a shared homeland.</p>
<p>In an October 2015 interview with Vice&rsquo;s i-D magazine, Adele explained that the Back to Black songwriter was the main inspiration behind her music career.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a music career that has grown into more of a success than she ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>&quot;If it wasn&#8217;t for Amy and [her 2003 debut album] Frank, 100% I wouldn&#8217;t have picked up a guitar,&rdquo; Adele told the publication at the time, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have written Daydreamer or Hometown, and I wrote &#8216;Someone Like You&#8217; on the guitar too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just in case you needed another reason to mourn Winehouse&#8217;s passing, right?</p>
<p>Who knows how many other would-be artists are out there who never got a chance to find out the sort of talent they possessed because Winehouse died so young.</p>
<p>Winehouse has been dead for years now, but her memory is still very much alive.</p>

<p>Amy, a documentary that chronicled nearly every aspect of Winehouse&rsquo;s life, was released in July 2015.</p>
<p>It went to win an Academy Award.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&rsquo;t going to [see it],&quot; Adele told Vice&rsquo;s i-D.</p>
<p>&quot; I loved her and I went through my own massive grieving process as her fan. I&rsquo;d finally got to a place where I felt really great about the impact she&#8217;d had on my life, in every way. I felt really, really fond of it all.</p>
<p>&quot;But then I read this review of it and that made me go and see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got super emotional with the funeral footage,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>&quot;But I wasn&rsquo;t really that into the saved voicemails and stuff like that. I felt like I was intruding so I actually felt a little bit uncomfortable and that ruined it for me. I love watching her, but I kind of wish I hadn&#8217;t seen it,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;But you know, I love Amy.</p>
<p>&quot;I always have, I always will. Do you know what makes me supe rsad? That I&#8217;m never going to hear her voice again, other than how I&#8217;ve heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Same here.</p>
<p>May Amy Winehouse rest in peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s been almost four years since <a href="/2011/07/amy-winehouse-dead-found-in-london-home/">Amy Winehouse died</a> from alcohol poisoning, and of all the stars who tragically joined the &quot;27 club,&quot; few make us wonder what might have been quite like Amy.</p>
<p>The singer had become an international sensation with Back to Black just a few years prior to her death, and many expected her to mature into one of the great singer/songwriters of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="/2011/07/drugs-to-blame-for-amy-winehouse-death/">Amy&#8217;s struggles with drugs and drinking</a> prevented her from ever recording a follow-up, and in July of 2011, she was found dead in her London home.</p>
<p>Now, award-winnning director&nbsp;Asif Kapadia&nbsp;is paying tribute to the woman with the unforgettable beehive &#8216;do and one-of-a-kind voice with a documentary that chronicles Winehouse&#8217;s meteoric rise and devastating fall:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/amy-documentary-teaser"></a></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not a girl trying to be a star,&quot; a young Amy tells an interviewer at one point.</p>
<p>Asked how famous she thinks she&#8217;ll become, Winehouse shyly replies, &quot;I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be at all famous. I don&#8217;t think I could handle it. I think I would go mad.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a side of the music legend that few fans ever saw, or even knew existed.</p>
<p>With her myriad tattoos and rebellious image, it was hard &#8211; at the height of her fame &#8211; to imagine Amy as anything other than bold, brash and endlessly self-assured.</p>
<p>As her struggles and tragic demise later reminded us, however, the spotlight never suited Winehouse, and her insecurities would eventually consume her.</p>
<p>Toward the end of her life, Amy became better-known for her tabloid misadventures than for her remarkable talent.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Kapadia&#8217;s film (due for release this summer) will remind the world of the genius that was so often overshadowed by her self-destructive tendencies.</p>

<p>BiNet USA, GLAAD and a slew of other organizations are joining forces to raise awareness and discussion of bisexuality within society. Their goal?</p>
<p>&quot;To help draw draw attention to the public policy concerns of bisexual people while also celebrating the great resiliency of bisexual culture and community.&quot;</p>
<p>Celebrate Bisexuality Day (often abbreviated CBD) has become an international awareness day that is also referred to as Bi Visibility Day and Bisexual Pride Day.</p>
<p>Three bisexual advocates, Wendy Curry, Michael Page and Gigi Raven Wilbur, initially conceived of the event as a way to combat bisexual invisibility.</p>
<p>While many <a href="/2014/08/9-bisexual-stars-well-play-for-either-team/">bisexual celebrities</a> have recently become very open about the way they are, ordinary people can have an especially hard time with this.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Often shunned by both straight and gay communities because their identities are routinely misunderstood, mistrusted, denied or erased, they struggle.</p>
<p>So scroll through the gallery above and see just a few of the stars you know who identify as bisexual, some of whom have spoken out about it.</p>
<p>In doing, so, they have tried to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/celebrate-bisexuality-day_n_5863320.html">change and shape perceptions</a> about what a bisexual person can and does look and act like, and that&#8217;s a worthy endeavor.</p>

<p>Gaga fans immediately noticed the resemblance, which was not mentioned by Gaga, pointing out the comparison in the comments time and again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Off to Australia. Will be dreaming of my Aussie Monsters,&#8221; wrote Gaga, with black hair and wing-tipped eyeliner nearly identical to Winehouse&#8217;s signature look.</p>

<p>The Lady is currently in the middle of her artRAVE: The ARTPOP Ball tour, and is next scheduled to make six stops in Australia starting August 20.</p>
<p>At 28, she has already lived a woman she once called her inspiration.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/07/amy-winehouse-dead-found-in-london-home/">Amy Winehouse died</a> at age 27 in July of 2011 due to extreme alcohol intoxication after years of drug and alcohol abuse and ending a promising career.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

<p>While Gaga didn&#8217;t mention Winehouse in her selfie, she clearly has a place in her heart for the British songbird whose album <em>Back to Black </em>was a landmark.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was my only hope when I was up and coming,&#8221; Lady Gaga told <em>Rolling Stone</em> of the soul singer soon after her shocking death three summers ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knew who I was and I had no fans, no record label and everybody, when they met me, said I wasn’t pretty enough or that my voice was too low or strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enter Winehouse and her uniquely riveting voice and talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had nowhere to put me. And then I saw her in Rolling Stone and I saw her live. I just remember thinking ‘Well, they found somewhere to put Amy.’&#8221;</p>
