<p>If you find yourself wondering who Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend is, or if he&#8217;s single and ready to mingle, we have the answer for you. </p>



<p>First, the bad news: yes, Jack Quaid is taken. </p>



<p>Second, the good news: Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend is his &#8220;<a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2024/06/the-boys-season-4-premiere-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>&#8221; co-star, Claudia Doumit. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend, Claudia Doumit, and their ongoing romantic relationship off-screen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jack-quaid-amp-claudia-doumit-went-public-in-2022">Jack Quaid &amp; Claudia Doumit Went Public In 2022</h2>



<p>Fans first got a glimpse at Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend when &#8220;The Boys&#8221; <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10895333/Jack-Quaid-appears-confirm-relationship-Boys-star-Claudia-Doumit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were photographed holding hands</a> in 2022. The pair were sight-seeing in Claudia Doumit&#8217;s hometown Sydney, Australia while traveling to promote &#8220;The Boys.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jack has been a lead on the Amazon Prime series since it premiered in 2019, while Claudia joined the cast in season two the following year. It&#8217;s unclear exactly when they took <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12905531/Jack-Quaid-PDA-girlfriend-Claudia-Doumit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things from co-workers to couple</a>. </p>



<p>Many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/v8mw55/jack_quaid_hughie_claudia_doumit_victoria_neuman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; speculated online</a> that the two had &#8220;chemistry&#8221; and a &#8220;flirty vibe&#8221; in their scenes together.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Jack <a href="https://people.com/jack-quaid-girlfriend-spend-valentines-day-disney-exclusive-8575581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke openly about his relationship</a> by sharing his plans to spend Valentine&#8217;s Day with Claudia at Disneyland with PEOPLE.</p>



<p>Just one month later they <a href="https://extratv.com/2024/03/10/jack-quaid-and-claudia-doumit-make-red-carpet-debut-at-oscars-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made their red carpet debut</a> at the 2024 Oscars in March. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-502049" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1918377418.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8216;The Boys&#8217; Cast: Jessie Usher, Chace Crawford, Jack Quaid, Eric Kripke, Claudia Doumit, Laz Alonso and Antony Starr attend the 2024 Astra TV Awards at Millennium Biltmore Hotel Los Angeles on January 08, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-boys-gender-swapped-claudia-doumit-s-role">&#8216;The Boys&#8217; Gender Swapped Claudia Doumit&#8217;s Role</h2>



<p>Since &#8220;The Boys&#8221; is based off of a comic series with the same name, fans might be interested to learn that Claudia Doumit&#8217;s role, politician Victoria Neuman, is actually based on a male character. </p>



<p>Instead of Victoria <a href="https://the-boys.fandom.com/wiki/Victor_Neuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the comics have Victor</a> (aka Vick the Veep). He is also a politician but that&#8217;s the only similarity between the characters, as Victor is considered &#8220;simple-minded&#8221; while Victoria is actually much more conniving. </p>



<p>Victor appears to be a short-lived character in the comics who is eventually killed by Homelander, the main antagonist in &#8220;The Boys&#8221; franchise. It remains to be seen if Victoria will suffer the same fate as Victor.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="724" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-1024x724.jpg" alt="Jack Quaid dating history" class="wp-image-502050" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-300x212.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-768x543.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-960x679.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-1080x764.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jack Quaid attends the GQ Men of the Year Celebration at The West Hollywood EDITION on November 18, 2021 in West Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-couple-are-on-opposing-sides-in-the-boys">The Couple Are On Opposing Sides In &#8216;The Boys&#8217;</h2>



<p>Even though Jack Quaid and Claudia Doumit are nothing but <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jack-quaid-and-claudia-doumits-relationship-is-going-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-eyes and PDA off-screen</a>, their on-screen personas — Hughie and Victoria, respectively — couldn&#8217;t be more different.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, Claudia&#8217;s Victoria is a politician <a href="https://the-boys.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Neuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who is also secretly a &#8220;supe&#8221;</a> (aka a human with superpowers). Though she originally presents as someone attempting to take down the supes and Vought, the entertainment conglomerate creating them, it&#8217;s unclear what her endgame really is. </p>



<p>Meanwhile Jack&#8217;s Hughie is one of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; alongside <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/the-boys-season-4-review-a-blood-soaked-mix-of-politics-and-gore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl Urban&#8217;s diabolical Billy Butcher</a>. They exist as a group solely to take down the supes and Vought and originally see Victoria as an ally until they learn the truth about her.</p>



<p>In the fourth season of &#8220;The Boys,&#8221; Victoria will be seen running for Vice President as a means to get into the White House which would be disastrous for obvious reasons. </p>



<p>When &#8220;The Boys&#8221; returns to Amazon Prime on June 13 we&#8217;ll see if Hughie, Billy and their team of misfit good guys are finally able to dismantle the evil Vought, the supes it created and, of course, their future VP, Victoria. </p>

<p>If you think that Jack Quaid looks familiar it&#8217;s likely due to his star-studded DNA. </p>



<p><em>The Boys</em> star got his break on the big screen in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/11/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-reviews-are-the-odds-in-its-f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2012&#8217;s <em>The Hunger Games,</em></a> but with parents like Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid he was always destined for Hollywood. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the mega stars that are Jack Quaid&#8217;s parents.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-story-of-meg-ryan-amp-dennis-quaid">The Story of Meg Ryan &amp; Dennis Quaid</h2>



<p>Like any typical Hollywood romance, <a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/tbt-meg-ryan-dennis-quaid-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid met</a> while working, filming 1987&#8217;s <em>Innerspace</em> together. But things didn&#8217;t heat up for the pair until their second film together, 1988&#8217;s <em>D.O.A </em>which is when they began dating, according to InStyle.</p>



<p>The pair married on Valentine&#8217;s Day in 1992 after four years together. On April 24, 1992 they welcomed their son, Jack Quaid, into the world. </p>



<p>But the &#8217;90s fairytale romance would only last the decade. Meg and Dennis divorced in 2001 following salacious rumors the <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> actress had an adulterous affair <a href="https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/meg-ryan-dennis-quaid-russell-crowe-what-happened-relationship-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Australian actor, Russell Crowe</a>. </p>



<p>Meg and Russell met in 2000 while filming <em>Proof of Life</em> and had a blip of a relationship that ended the same year. But, the repercussions had a lasting effect on the actress once known as &#8220;America&#8217;s Sweetheart.&#8221;</p>



<p>The alleged affair became such a tabloid spectacle that many critics believe it <a href="https://ew.com/article/2000/09/28/what-repercussions-will-meg-ryan-russell-crowe-affair-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tanked Meg&#8217;s ability to draw an audience</a>. </p>



<p>Both Meg and Dennis have since confirmed that their romantic connection <a href="https://www.thelist.com/308913/what-really-happened-with-meg-ryan-and-russell-crowe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already fizzled out</a> by the time Meg moved on (albeit briefly) with Russell. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-call-jack-quaid-a-nepo-baby-in-front-of-his-mom">Don&#8217;t Call Jack Quaid A Nepo Baby In Front Of His Mom</h2>



<p>Now that Jack&#8217;s acting career has taken off, thanks in part to his role as Hughie on Amazon Prime&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2024/06/the-boys-season-4-premiere-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>,&#8221; many have given him the title of &#8220;Nepo Baby.&#8221; The nickname has a negative connotation as it implies that children of celebrities only become &#8220;famous&#8221; or &#8220;successful&#8221; because of who their parents are. </p>



<p>Meg Ryan wholeheartedly disagrees. </p>



<p>“[Jack]&#8217;s more of a natural than I&#8217;ll ever be,” the <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/getting-cozy-with-meg-ryan-cover-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actress and mother told </a><em><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/getting-cozy-with-meg-ryan-cover-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a> </em>in November 2023. “That nepo stuff is so dismissive of his work ethic, his gifts and how sensitive he is to the idea of his privilege.”</p>



<p>However, Jack claims his mom doesn&#8217;t want to watch &#8220;The Boys,&#8221; which premieres its fourth season on June 13.</p>



<p>But why? The way Jack explains it, his actress mom doesn&#8217;t enjoy watching him &#8220;always in peril.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always on the verge of death,&#8221; he claims she told him after watching the hit series first season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jack-quaid-faces-a-civil-war-in-the-boys-season-4">Jack Quaid Faces A Civil War In &#8216;The Boys&#8217; Season 4</h2>



<p>Speaking of &#8220;The Boys,&#8221; the fourth season will see Jack Quaid&#8217;s Hughie back in action in hopes of saving the world from &#8220;supes&#8221; (aka humans with super powers). </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the series, the premise is that &#8220;The Boys&#8221; — Karl Urban&#8217;s Butcher, Laz Alonso&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Milk, Tomer Capone&#8217;s Frenchie and Karen Fukuhara&#8217;s Kimiko — come together to take down Vought. The corporation poses as an international entertainment conglomerate but is actually responsible for the invention and distribution of a drug called Compound V. </p>



<p>The drug is behind the creation of supes all over the world including The Seven, a handful of A-List supes that are basically just a marketing stunt to make Vought look good. In reality, most of The Seven, <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-boys-antony-starr-homelander-supporters-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially their leader Homelander</a> (Antony Starr), are villains hiding in plain sight. </p>



<p>Season four of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; will show us <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-boys-season-3-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happens after Maeve</a> (Dominique McElligot) sacrificed her powers to take down Solider Boy (Jensen Ackles), if undercover supe Victoria Neuman (portrayed by Jack Quaid&#8217;s off-screen girlfriend, Claudia Doumit) will make it into the White House, and the future of Homelander as a &#8220;hero&#8221; after he murdered a protester on live television.</p>



<p>The first episode of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; season four premiered on June 13 on Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>Many called shenanigans right off the bat, and it was widely suspected that we were all being punked by a&nbsp;<a href="/2015/04/jimmy-kimmel-on-dennis-quaid-meltdown-not-my-handiwork/">Quaid and Jimmy Kimmel prank</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, the clip&nbsp;<em>was</em> part of a skit, and Quaid is not a foul-mouthed douche. (Sorry, Christian Bale.) However, we we wrong&nbsp;to suspect Kimmel. (Sorry, Jimmy.)</p>
<p>The &quot;meltdown&quot; video was actually a teaser for a Funny or Die sketch&nbsp;starring Quaid, and a fresh new up-and-comer named Dopey the Dick. We think he&#8217;s only gonna get bigger:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dennis-quaid-meltdown-the-full-story"></a></figure>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have the 4 minutes to check out the skit (though we seriously suggest you do), just know that Quaid wasn&#8217;t trying to demean anyone by calling them zombies, babies and p-ssies.</p>
<p>He was actually being stared at by literal zombies, an infant, and a basket of adorable kittens.</p>
<p>As for Dopey the Dick, well&#8230;we&#8217;re sure he&#8217;ll recover. The kid&#8217;s got balls.</p>
<p>Now if only we could find out that the <a href="/2015/02/randy-quaid-sex-video-insane-actor-really-gives-it-to-wife-weari/">Randy Quaid sex tape</a> that inexplicably made the rounds online last month was also a fake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, please tell us that was some kind of prank or terrible dream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Jimmy Kimmel says he wasn&#8217;t behind the viral video of <a href="/2015/04/dennis-quaid-freak-out-caught-on-video-im-acting-here-d-ckhead/">Dennis Quaid&#8217;s meltdown</a> on a movie set, though he acknowledges why people might assume he was.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/jimmy-kimmel-blamed-for-dennis-quaid-meltdown"></a></figure>
<p>Kimmel, whose penchant for pranks is legendary and whose <a href="/2013/09/epic-twerking-fail-actually-a-jimmy-kimmel-prank/">epic Twerking fail</a> duped the entire Internet, addressed the video on last night&#8217;s show.</p>
<p>The hilarious host said he was stunned (yet not really) to hear rumors blaming him for the viral clip that shows the Quaid cussing out a crew member.</p>
<p>&quot;I watched that video last night about 14 times&hellip; and when I woke up this morning, I was being blamed for it,&quot; Jimmy said of Dennis&#8217; ultimate freakout.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two dozen articles online, thousands of comments suggesting that this is a prank video,&quot; Kimmel added, &quot;and now I&#8217;m responsible for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to say it&#8217;s disappointing because, you play 50 pranks and all of a sudden people don&#8217;t trust you anymore,&quot; the late night mainstay quipped.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true; Kanye West&#8217;s feud with Jimmy was real, but widely assumed to be fake as well back when the rapper was unleashing his wrath on Kimmel.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dennis-quaid-tantrum-video"></a></figure>
<p>The actor&#8217;s camp has yet to comment on the amazing video, which blew up online on Tuesday after a user posted it to Reddit, and reeks of a hoax.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old actor brushed off a TMZ reporter&#8217;s question about the clip, in which he goes ballistic after someone off screen breaks his concentration.</p>
<p>&quot;I am acting here, and this d&#8212;head wanders onto my set,&quot; Quaid yells incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#8217;t even get a line out until Dopey the D&#8211;k starts whispering in your ear!&quot;</p>
<p>Like Kimmel, we really need to start adding that insult to our daily repertoire.</p>
<p>Quaid, who calls himself &quot;a pro,&quot; then slams the film as &quot;the most unprofessional set I have ever been on&quot; and rips the stunned crew as &quot;zombies&quot; and p&#8212;ies.&quot;</p>
<p>Beyond his TMZ non-answer, Dennis hilariously participated in some hidden camera pranks on <em>Ellen</em> years ago, so this is fishy to say the least. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Dennis Quaid&nbsp;is the latest actor to become the subject of a viral video thanks to his bad behavior on set.</p>
<p>Just like when <a href="/videos/christian-bale-rant/">Christian Bale freaked out</a> on the crew of Terminator: Salvation, Dennis&#8217; tantrum is in ironic nature:</p>
<p>He feels there&#8217;s too much unprofessional behavior going on&#8230;so he expresses his thoughts in a profanity-laced tirade.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dennis-quaid-tantrum-video"></a></figure>
<p>Quaid&#8217;s rant isn&#8217;t as long as Bale&#8217;s, but it&#8217;s every bit as bizarre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems he was in the middle of a scene when a member of the crew &quot;wandered onto [his] set.&quot; We can see how that would be rather annoying, but it hardly justifies Quaid&#8217;s wildly over-the-top reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;I am acting here, and this d-ckhead&nbsp;wanders onto my set,&quot; Quaid screams at the film&#8217;s director. &quot;I&nbsp;can&#8217;t even get a line out until dopey the d-ck&nbsp;starts whispering in your ear.&nbsp;You&#8217;re not even watching anymore!</p>
<p>&quot;This is the most unprofessional set I have ever been on. This is horsesh-t!&quot;</p>
<p>He goes on to refer to the crew as &quot;zombies,&quot; &quot;p-ssies,&quot; and &quot;babies.&quot; As he storms off a set, Quaid even throws in a &quot;blow me&quot; for good measure.</p>
<p>Not cool, by any means, but we much prefer that sort of scandalous footage to the <a href="/2015/02/randy-quaid-sex-video-insane-actor-really-gives-it-to-wife-weari/">Randy Quaid sex tape</a> recently uploaded by Dennis&#8217; brother.</p>
<p>Not a proud couple of months for the Quaid family.</p>

He teams up with her and they prank strangers!</p>
<p>This week, she had Dennis fake a series of health issues &#8211; some of which aren&#8217;t even possible &#8211; just to have fun with a nurse on set. Safe to say it worked.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dennis-quaid-prank-on-ellen"></a></figure>
<p>From lung problems to shrinking, the actor had the unassuming nurse run through a variety of utterly ridiculous tests &#8211; with Ellen&#8217;s guidance of course.</p>
<p>The poor nurse didn&#8217;t even realize what was going on when the reveal finally came. Gotta hand it to her for remaining professional throughout all of that.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Ellen and Dennis have teamed up for some hidden camera hijinks. Watch more of their hilarious moments in recent years below:</p>

<p>The reason?</p>

<p>&#8220;Kimberly is fed up with Dennis&#8217; cheating,&#8221; an insider tells TMZ, adding <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2012/10/19/dennis-quaid-wife-kimberly-buffington-quaid-separation-divorce/">of Quaid</a>: &#8220;He&#8217;s not a good husband.&#8221;</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Kimberly is represented by infamous divorce layer Laura Wasser and is seeking spousal support, along with legal and sole physical custody of the couple&#8217;s four-year-old twins.</p>
<p>Buffington-Quaid must wait a few months before officially filing because the couple &#8211; which has been married eight years &#8211; just moved to California and there&#8217;s a six month residency requirement in that state.</p>
<p>The Quaids have gone through a whole lot together.</p>
<p>Their twins almost died shortly after birth because they were given an overdose of a drug at the hospital.</p>

<p>Kimberly is asking for spousal support and attorney&#8217;s fees.</p>

<p>There is a temporary custody order in place, assuring that both Dennis and Kimberly each get time with their kids, and divides use of their residences.</p>
<p>Kimberly is asking that all of their community assets be fairly divided. In Dennis&#8217; answer to Kimberly&#8217;s petition, he says he wants her to get nothing.</p>
<p>Both Dennis and Kimberly Buffington-Quaid, who married in 2004, are ordered not to say anything &#8220;vulgar, profane, obscene or indecent&#8221; to each other.</p>
<p>In 2007, they welcomed twins, who nearly died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in L.A. after they were given a massive overdose of the drug Heparin.</p>
<p>Dennis Quaid was previously married to Meg Ryan and P.J. Soles.</p>

<p>At Philippe restaurant in West Hollywood early this morning. Quaid, his wife Kimberly and a friend walked outside where valet had already brought their car.</p>
<p>The motor was running, <a href="http://www.fox8live.com/entertainment/story/Quaid-narrowly-avoids-DUI-arrest/GLFhPDdHAU6GYvDVMcAF2Q.cspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they got in</a> and Quaid got behind the wheel.</p>
<p>He turned the wheel a matter of inches but had not yet shifted it into drive when a local policeman pulled up alongside and urged the actor to call a cab.</p>
<p>Dennis responded that he didn&#8217;t want to drive. The cop repeatedly said, &#8220;Get out of the car.&#8221; Quaid responded, &#8220;What do you want me to do?!&#8221; He then grew some brain cells and asked if they could go back in the restaurant and the cop said yes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Dennis Quaid and wife Kimberly lucked out last night.</em></p>
<p>The Quaids did end up taking a cab home and he came back for the car a short while ago. Interestingly, he could have been arrested from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>The car was on and he was behind the wheel, but the police officer used his discretion and decided not to pursue it. Maybe he should thank the paparazzi.</p>
<p>Members of the celebrity gossip media mobbing the scene joked with Quaid, saying &#8220;You don&#8217;t want a DUI. You don&#8217;t want to end up like <a href="/2006/07/mel-gibson-drives-drunk-swears-uncontrollably-hates-jews-people-threatens-cops-tries-to-break/">Mel Gibson</a>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard to argue with that.</p>
<p>Good to see Dennis make the right choice in the end &#8230; even if it caused a scene and took more than a little cajoling. All&#8217;s well that ends well, right?</p>
<p>Besides, even if he had been arrested and tossed in the drunk tank overnight, <a href="/2009/10/randy-and-evi-quaid-still-crazy-facing-extradition/">Randi and Evi Quaid</a> would still be the black sheep of the family.</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2009/10/police-celebrity-gossip-photographers-talk-dennis-quaid-out-of-d/">Police, Celebrity Gossip Photographers Talk Dennis Quaid Out of DUI</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>

<p>Considering Quaid is a successful actor with a seemingly healthy bank account, that&#8217;s strange &#8211; but it&#8217;s not the strangest aspect of this story.</p>
<p>According to Radar Online, private investigator Becky Altringer says Evi Quaid has a connection to Conrad Murray; yes, the same <a href="/2009/09/dr-conrad-murray-lone-focus-of-michael-jackson-homicide-investigation/">Conrad Murray</a> <strong>suspected of playing a major role in the death of Michael Jackson</strong>.</p>
<p>Altringer claims Mrs. Quaid also used the shady doctor to fill numerous drug prescriptions, including one for Demerol, which she allegedly snorts on a regular basis.</p>
<p>“Evi told me she got her Demerol from Dr. Murray and plus another doctor,” Altringer <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2009/09/exclusive-pi-says-evi-quaid-michael-jackson-had-drug-connection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the website</a>. “She told me that she and Michael Jackson had the same doctors.”</p>

<p>Through the course of her investigation, Altringer reportedly found other pills prescribed to Evi and believes the drugs have led to the woman&#8217;s erratic behavior; the latest example of which just <a href="/2009/09/evi-quaid-flips-out-on-cop-paints-sign-is-insane/">took place on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>“Evi told me she believed Michael Jackson had been murdered, along with David Carradine, Heath Ledger, Chris Penn and Natasha Richardson,” Altringer said. “She thought everyone was out to get her, and blamed everything on &#8216;the Mob.’”</p>
<p>The private eye also alleges that Evi Quaid often beat on her husband, forcing him into a life of alcoholism.</p>
<p>If true, this would place his role in <em>Christmas Vacation</em> in an entirely new light.</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2009/09/pi-links-evi-quaid-to-conrad-murray/">P.I.
