<p>Aaron Carter passed away in 2022. His young son is now 3 years old.</p>



<p>Prince Carter just made his red carpet debut.</p>



<p>This bittersweet occasion involves a new documentary following his family&#8217;s tragedies.</p>



<p>He also looks like a precious mini-me. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-carter-stepped-out-on-the-red-carpet">Prince Carter stepped out on the red carpet</h2>



<p>On Wednesday, April 9, 3-year-old Princeton Lyrik Carter made his red carpet debut.</p>



<p>The precious child, son of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/aaron-carter-fiancee-melanie-martin-where-is-she-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanie Martin</a> and the late Aaron Carter, appeared with his mother and other family.</p>



<p>This was not just any red carpet event. This was a screening of <em>The Carters: Hurts To Love You</em>, which delves into the toll that fame exacted upon this famous family. This impacted Aaron at a particularly young age.</p>

<p>Prince truly looks like he&#8217;s living up to his name. He looked very much like a fancy little man in a black leather jacket. </p>



<p>And did you peep those Batman sneakers? <em>Adorable</em>.</p>



<p>Prince was just shy of one year old at the time of Aaron&#8217;s tragic death. </p>



<p>It is conceivable that he has faint memories of his departed father, but Aaron Carter is likely more of an <em>idea</em> to him than anything else. </p>



<p>This sensation is unlikely to fade as he grows up in his late father&#8217;s shadow.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-722x1024.jpg" alt="Aaron Carter on August 19, 2017." class="wp-image-523175" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-722x1024.jpg 722w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-211x300.jpg 211w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-768x1090.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-676x960.jpg 676w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-761x1080.jpg 761w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02-846x1200.jpg 846w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/0410_aaroncarter_02.jpg 847w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Singer/songwriter Aaron Carter attends Project Angel Food&#8217;s 2017 Angel Awards on August 19, 2017.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Alison Buck/Getty Images for Project Angel Food)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-was-a-precious-albeit-bittersweet-moment">This was a precious, albeit bittersweet moment</h2>



<p>To his credit, Prince seemed totally relaxed in his mother&#8217;s arms, even as countless cameras snapped photos of him.</p>



<p>Others on the red carpet were more familiar with the limelight, including David Arquette and Tori Spelling.</p>



<p>And, of course, Angel Carter Conrad &#8212; Aaron&#8217;s twin sister &#8212; was there.</p>



<p> She even posed with her little nephew.</p>

<p>On November 5, 2022, Aaron Carter was found dead at home. He was only 34 years old.</p>



<p>The singer had been worrying fans for years with various red flags, behavioral incidents, legal troubles, and actions that appeared to be cries for help.</p>



<p>He had died from drowning. The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed-horrible-and-tragic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical examiner</a> ruled that his tragic death was an accident, one following use of alprazolam and a flammable gas, difluoroethane.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-did-not-truly-get-to-know-his-father">Prince did not truly get to know his father</h2>



<p>Just two months before his passing, Aaron had checked himself into an outpatient program. </p>



<p>At the time, Martin had full temporary custody of Prince. Aaron clearly hoped to regain custody of their son.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Aaron did not live to set things right. </p>



<p>On some level, his loved ones will always wonder what he&#8217;d be like today if he were still with us.</p>

<p>Where is Aaron Carter&#8217;s fiancée, Melanie Martin, today? Many are wondering what happened to the model in the years after Aaron&#8217;s accidental death at 34 years old on November 5, 2022. </p>



<p>Melanie, 32, is now working to become a fashion and beauty influencer by taking over the LOVE apparel brand Aaron started in 2019. If you take a look at her social media, she heavily promotes the brand which is now sold exclusively at <a href="https://aaroncarter.love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aaroncarter.love</a>. </p>



<p>The brand includes beauty products like foundation and a highlighter palette that are branded &#8220;LOVE by Mel,&#8221; while other products like beanies, hoodies and t-shirts have the name &#8220;Carter&#8221; printed on them. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-500704" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-960x641.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jane Carter and Aaron Carter attend WE tv Celebrates the 100th Episode of the &#8220;Marriage Boot Camp&#8221; reality stars franchise and the premiere of &#8220;Marriage Boot Camp Family Edition&#8221; at SkyBar at the Mondrian Los Angeles on October 10, 2019 in West Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images for WE tv )</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fans were not happy about Mel taking over the business, even going so far as to <a href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-melanie-martin-from-selling-aaron-s-belongings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start an online petition</a> for Aaron&#8217;s brother, Nick Carter, to take over instead. Unfortunately for them, the petition was unsuccessful and petered out around 135 signatures.</p>



<p>Melanie also has <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/12/15/aaron-carters-fiancee-melanie-martin-regains-custody-of-son-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full custody of her and Aaron&#8217;s son</a>, Prince Lyric Carter, who was born November 22, 2021, just less than a year before his death. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-melanie-martin-get-aaron-carter-s-estate">Did Melanie Martin Get Aaron Carter&#8217;s Estate?</h2>



<p>At the time of his death, Aaron had a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/aaron-carter-made-fortune-untimely-173526531.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth of approximately $550k</a> — a far cry from the estimated $200 million he was worth before turning 18, as reported by <em>Yahoo! Finance.</em></p>



<p>Since the young pop star didn&#8217;t have a will, the state of California was in charge of deciding who inherit what was left of his fortune. Aaron&#8217;s twin sister, Angel Carter, rushed to petition the court to choose her as the estate&#8217;s sole beneficiary. </p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, Angel rescinded her petition and shared that she and Aaron&#8217;s fiancée, Melanie, had agreed <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/aaron-carter-estate-500000-sister-angel-fiancee-melanie-martin-steps-down-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third party be made administrator</a> of the estate. It&#8217;s unclear if either of them have or will receive any sort of financial compensation from the estate at this time. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-carter-s-relationship-turmoil">Aaron Carter&#8217;s Relationship Turmoil</h2>



<p>While Melanie&#8217;s social media suggests that her and Aaron&#8217;s relationship was picture perfect, the truth is that it was far from it. </p>



<p>The couple went public as a couple in January 2020. In their first six months together <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-carter-girlfriend-melanie-martin-split-after-her-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanie was arrested</a> for alleged domestic violence, they broke up, got back together, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/aaron-carters-on-off-girlfriend-melanie-martin-suffered-miscarriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a miscarriage</a> and got engaged. </p>



<p>In March 2021, Aaron proudly shared a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9336451/Aaron-Carter-fiance-Melanie-Martin-reveal-positive-pregnancy-test-Instagram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive pregnancy test</a> on Instagram — eight months later, Melanie underwent an emergency C-section and delivered the couple&#8217;s first and only child, son Prince. </p>



<p>&#8220;Prince is precious, I love you son,&#8221; Aaron wrote on Instagram when <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1310716/aaron-carter-welcomes-baby-boy-with-fiancee-melanie-martin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing the exciting news</a>. </p>



<p>Less than a week later Aaron announced <a href="https://www.aol.com/aaron-carter-fianc-e-melanie-203900784.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he and Melanie had split</a>, again, this time because he found out she had been communicating with his &#8220;conniving, deceiving family.&#8221; He claimed he felt betrayed because his family had allegedly tried to put him in prison and get a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/britney-spears-reacts-to-end-of-conservatorship-best-day-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney Spears-style conservatorship</a> on him. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-s-final-year-with-melanie-martin">Aaron&#8217;s Final Year With Melanie Martin</h2>



<p>When Aaron and Melanie split for the third time in early 2022, things took a more serious turn. </p>



<p>Aaron filed for a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10553571/Aaron-Carter-files-custody-son-amid-restraining-order-petition-against-ex-Melanie-Martin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restraining order against Melanie</a> as well as full custody of their son, Prince, in February 2022. He cited &#8220;emotional distress&#8221; as well as &#8220;shoving&#8221; as his reasons for the protective order. </p>



<p>Melanie fired back with her own restraining order in March 2022, claiming that Aaron was physically abusive and had <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/03/05/aaron-carter-ex-accuses-singer-of-breaking-three-of-her-ribs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly broken three of her ribs</a>, according to a <em>Page Six </em>report.</p>



<p>At the time, Aaron made <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/393001-aaron-carters-ex-melanie-martin-files-for-restraining-order-says-he-broke-her-ribs-report-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several shocking claims</a> against Melanie, including that she was a &#8220;scam artist&#8221; who had allegedly tried to push him over his second story banister. Melanie countered these claims by alleging that Aaron was in need of &#8220;anger management&#8221; and claiming he became violent after taking &#8220;too many&#8221; prescription pills.  </p>



<p>Both Aaron and Melanie <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/aaron-carters-ex-fianc-e-000602831.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost custody of Prince</a> in mid-2022 due to the hostile nature of their relationship, as reported by Yahoo. Custody of Prince was awarded to Melanie&#8217;s mother. </p>



<p>&#8220;Aaron and I did lose custody of Prince. I think that the real downfall was him losing custody and not knowing what was going to happen,&#8221; Melanie shared in &#8220;Aaron Carter: The Little Prince of Pop,&#8221; a documentary on Hulu about Aaron&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Basically, Aaron had a manic episode. We had a heated fight and it was lingering on for a few days,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Melanie will next be seen talking about Aaron and their relationship in the upcoming docu-series &#8220;Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter&#8221; when it premieres on Sunday, May 26 at 9pm est on Investigation Discovery.</p>

<p>Back in November of 2022, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-died-without-a-will-state-will-decide-who-inherits-his-property-report/">Aaron Carter passed away </a>at his home in Lancaster, California.</p>



<p>Carter&#8217;s body was found in a bathtub full of water &#8212; a scene eerily reminiscent of Whitney Houston&#8217;s passing in 2012.</p>



<p>Naturally, outside observers were quick to conclude that Carter had met a similar fate.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, authorities announced <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">Carter&#8217;s cause of death</a>, and few were surprised to learn that he had lost consciousness due to multiple drug intoxication and drowned in just a few inches of water.</p>

<p>But those who knew Aaron best maintain that there are many questions left unanswered by the official explanation for his demise.</p>



<p>His mother, Jane Carter, and his fiancée, Melanie Martin, are both convinced that there was foul play involved in Aaron&#8217;s passing. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carters-family-rejects-cause-of-death-findings-maintains-singer-was-murdered/">Martin spoke out</a> against the official ruling about Carter&#8217;s cause of death.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>And now, it looks as though the family has decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>



<p>According to a<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/20/aaron-carter-fiancee-second-autopsy-suspects-foul-play-dead-dies/"> new report</a> from TMZ, Melanie and the Carters are seeking to have Aaron&#8217;s case re-examined by a private investigator.</p>



<p>They also want a second autopsy, this one to be carried out by a private medical examiner hired by Aaron&#8217;s loved ones.</p>

<p>Melanie reported informed TMZ that she shares Jane&#8217;s belief that Aaron was murdered &#8212; both women point to the fact that Carter was wearing clothes in the bathtub as their primary evidence &#8212; but she&#8217;s worried they won&#8217;t be able to afford a private investigation.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s likely that the Carters will announce a fundraiser sometime in the near future.</p>



<p>“Still trying to get a real investigation for the death of my son Aaron Carter,” Jane wrote on Instagram last month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“They never investigated it as a possible crime scene because of his addiction past,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>“But they allowed people to go in and out.although a lot of potential homicide information was there for years. Aaron had a lot of death threats and many many people who were making his life miserable.”</p>



<p>Jane also alleged that the death threats were not “taken seriously by law enforcement” by police, who discriminated against Aaron because of his past struggles.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if the Carters will be able to conduct their own investigation into Aaron&#8217;s final hours.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s very clear that Jane and Melanie believe this case is far from closed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been five months since<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-died-without-a-will-state-will-decide-who-inherits-his-property-report/"> Aaron Carter was found dead </a>in the bathroom of his Lancaster, California home.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, investigators finally revealed the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed-horrible-and-tragic/">cause of Carter&#8217;s death</a>.</p>



<p>A toxicology report indicated that the former child star drowned in his bathtub after passing out from a combination of Xanax and difluoroethane, an ingredient in household aerosol cleaners that can be huffed for a momentary high.</p>



<p>Carter had struggled with substance abuse throughout his life, and the findings aligned with what fans knew about his lifestyle.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin is the mother of Aaron Carter&#8217;s child. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But some of those were closest to Carter say they&#8217;re not buying the official explanation for his death.</p>



<p>Since the day of the singer&#8217;s demise, his fiancée, Melanie Martin, and his mother, Jane Carter, have remained firm in their belief that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/03/aaron-carters-mother-says-she-has-proof-he-was-murdered/">Aaron was murdered</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Martin has essentially launched a one-woman PR campaign with the apparent goal of having the investigation reopened.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“The results of the autopsy are not closure for me,” <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/18/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-drowning-xanax-alprazolam-huffing/">Martin told</a> TMZ this week. </p>



<p>“It claims death is by drowning but also adds he was wearing a t-shirt and necklace in the bathtub which doesn’t make sense, why would he be in a bathtub with clothes on?&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am still in shock and still miss Aaron every day. I don’t understand the chain of events and this report only has us asking more questions.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Melanie echoed those comments in an interview with UK tabloid <em>The Sun</em>.</p>



<p>“I am not getting the closure I need because I don’t buy it,” she told the outlet.</p>



<p>“He was found with clothing on, the coroner told me, how would he have drowned with clothing on,&#8221; Martin added.</p>



<p>“I still have a lot more questions I would like answered regarding the police investigation,” Melanie continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Aaron was in the habit of huffing household cleaners during his live Instagram streams, but in his final interviews, he reported that he had given the habit up.</p>



<p>He admitted that he was on a “regimented medication” plan that involved Xanax, but he claimed he only used the sedative because it helped keep him “clean from huffing dust.”</p>



<p>The insistence that Carter was murdered is a little surprising coming from Melanie, who previously revealed that she was Aaron helping Aaron try to get sober in the day&#8217;s leading up to his tragic passing.</p>

<p>But Aaron&#8217;s mother has been claiming for months that material evidence found at the scene of her son&#8217;s death indicates foul play, and clearly, Melanie has joined her in that belief.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>We have an update on the passing of Aaron Carter.</p>



<p>As reported in November, the troubled <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">singer and reality star died</a> just about five and a half months ago at the young age of 34.</p>



<p>According to TMZ sources at the time, Carter’s corpse was discovered in a bathtub&#8230; with law enforcement officials telling the celebrity gossip website that they received a 911 call about an individual having drowned inside of his home.</p>



<p>No cause of death was announced back then.</p>

<p>Now, however, the Los Angeles Country Medical Examiner-Coroner has completed its investigation.</p>



<p>The musician reportedly drowned after inhaling difluoroethane &#8212; which is a gas often used in cans of compressed air &#8212; and after taking alprazolam, the generic form of brand-name Xanax.</p>



<p>The report states Carter was &#8220;incapacitated while in the bathtub&#8221; as the drugs took effect, slipping under the surface of the water and never coming back up.</p>



<p>TMZ broke this awful news late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Carter&#8217;s ex-fiancée, Melanie Martin, who is also the mother of his child, spoke to TMZ last night and said she questioned this report. </p>



<p>&#8220;The results of the autopsy are not closure for me,&#8221; Martin told the outlet. </p>



<p>&#8220;It claims death is by drowning but also adds he was wearing a t-shirt and necklace in the bathtub which doesn&#8217;t make sense, why would he be in a bathtub with clothes on? </p>



<p>&#8220;I am still in shock and still miss Aaron every day. I don’t understand the chain of events and this report only has us asking more questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter struggled with addiction over the years.</p>



<p>The brother of Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter, Aaron had said he was five years sober in early 2022, but he also checked into a rehab facility as recently as last September.</p>



<p>Carter was known for his early 2000s hits “Aaron’s Party (Come Get It),” “I Want Candy” and “That’s How I Beat Shaq.”</p>



<p>Martin <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carters-fiancee-breaks-silence-on-tragic-death-of-young-singer/">commented on the tragedy shortly after Aaron passed away</a> in November.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“I love Aaron with all my heart and it’s going to be a journey to raise a son without a father,&#8221; Martin said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Please respect the privacy of my family as we come to terms with the loss of someone we love greatly.</p>



<p>“We are still in the process of accepting this unfortunate reality. Your thoughts and prayers are greatly appreciated.”</p>



<p>Eerily enough, a number of fans apparently believed this fall that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/melanie-martin-aaron-carters-fans-think-i-murdered-him/">Martin murdered Carter</a> &#8212; an allegation that is not supported by any evidence.</p>

<p>Said Nick Carter in response to his sibling&#8217;s death last year:</p>



<p>&#8220;My heart is broken.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though my brother and I have had a complicated relationship, my love for him has never ever faded. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have always held on to the hope that he would somehow, someday want to walk a healthy path and eventually find the help that he so desperately needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter faced many legal troubles and sought treatment for years due to his substance abuse addiction.</p>



<p>He was pulled over for suspicion of DUI less than a week before his death, although officers found that he wasn&#8217;t under the influence after conducting a field sobriety test.</p>



<p>&#8220;To my twin… I loved you beyond measure,&#8221; said sister Angel in response to Carter&#8217;s death. </p>



<p>&#8220;You will be missed dearly. My funny, sweet Aaron, I have so many memories of you … and I promise to cherish them. I know you&#8217;re at peace now. </p>



<p>&#8220;I will carry you with me until the day I die and get to see you again</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been four months since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">Aaron Carter passed away</a> in the bathroom of his home in Lancaster, California.</p>



<p>No official cause of death has been released, as investigators are still awaiting the results of a toxicology report.</p>



<p>Medical examiners confirmed, however, that despite being found in a bathtub full of water, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">Aaron did not drown</a>, a set of circumstances that&#8217;s led many to conclude the singer died of an overdose.</p>



<p>Police have stated that there was no sign of foul play, but now Aaron&#8217;s mother, Jane Carter, has revealed that she believes her son was murdered.</p>

<p>Jane took to Facebook this week to share some grisly photos from the scene of Aaron&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>One photo shows a bathtub full of green-tinted water, the coloring apparently a result of the fact that Carter&#8217;s body remained in the water for several hours after he died.</p>



<p>Others show feces splattered across the bathroom floor, which Jane says is evidence that Aaron was not in the bathtub when he died.</p>

<p>In the caption to her post, Jane wrote that she made the difficult decision to share the pics because she&#8217;s “still trying to get a real investigation for the death of my son.”</p>



<p>“I want to share these death scene photos with you all because the coroner wrote it off as an accidental drug overdose,” she explained.</p>



<p>“They never investigated it as a possible crime scene because of his addiction past,” she claimed of the star who had long struggled with addiction and mental health issues,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Jane went on to allege that police contaminated the crime scene shortly after they arrived, having apparently concluded that because Carter overdosed, there was no need to take the investigation seriously.</p>



<p>“Look at the photos. They were not taken by the police. But they allowed people to go in and out,” she said, adding that cops and other personnel proceeded “tromp through&#8221; the bathroom.</p>



<p>Aaron&#8217;s mom went on to refer to &#8220;death threats&#8221; that she says the LAPD failed to properly investigate.</p>

<p>Shocking news out of the music world today, as Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter has been accused of raping an underage fan in 2001.</p>



<p>In a newly-filed lawsuit and a press conference that was livestreamed on Facebook, Shannon “Shay” Ruth alleged that Carter sexually assaulted her when they met backstage at a concert when she was just 17 years old.</p>



<p>Ruth, who is now 39, lives with autism and cerebral palsy.</p>



<p>She says that Carter took advantage of her vulnerable state and mocked her condition after he assaulted her.</p>

<p>“The last 21 years have been filled with pain, confusion, frustration, shame and self-harm that are a direct result of Nick Carter raping me,” Ruth said during today&#8217;s press conference.</p>



<p>“Even though I’m autistic and live with cerebral palsy, I believe that nothing has affected me more or had a more lasting impact on my life than what Nick Carter did and said to me,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>“After he raped me, I remember him calling me a ‘re—-ed bitch’ and grabbing me and leaving bruises on my arm.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Addressing the question of why she waited more than 20 years to speak out, Ruth explained that she was terrified of going public.</p>



<p>“Carter tried to scare me into silence … he was nasty and threatening,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Ruth added that was hesitant to speak out because she believed that she could “go to jail” if she told her story.</p>

<p></p>



<p>She eventually came forward, she said, in the hope that she might be able to “stop” Carter from “assaulting more teens and women” and “hold Nick Carter accountable.”</p>



<p>“Just because Nick Carter is a celebrity does not mean that he is excused from his crimes,” the victim concluded. </p>



<p>“I am a survivor and always will be.”</p>



<p>“Nick Carter has a long history of abusing women,” said Ruth&#8217;s attorney Mark J. Boskovich, adding that the music industry allegedly has a history of “looking away.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nick Carter at the height of his fame with the Backstreet Boys. </figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The lawsuit also mentions three other accusers who are identified only as Jane Doe.</p>



<p>“Shay is determined to bring Carter to justice,” Boskovich said. </p>



<p>“She believes it’s worth it to protect other women.”</p>

<p>Someone very close to Aaron Carter has provided an update on the state of the artist before he passed away this month.</p>



<p>In an interview with Page Six, Taylor Helgeson., who served as a manager for the troubled artist, said he saw Carter just two days before his body was found inside his California home.</p>



<p>“He looked thin. He was extremely tired,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/11/17/aaron-carter-was-in-physical-decline-before-he-died-manager/">Helgeson told this outlet</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;He just looked like he needed to be doing anything but working. He looked like he needed to be taking care of him.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-troubled-singer-and-reality-star-dead-at-34/">Carter was discovered by a housekeeper</a> back on November 4 and pronounced dead at the scene after paramedics arrived.</p>



<p>No cause of death has been announced.</p>



<p>However, Carter had an extensive history of substance abuse, having been in and out of rehab on several occasions over the years.</p>



<p>Prior to his passing, though, Carter had recently said he was clean and sober.</p>

<p>Helgeson had been managing Carter for eight months at the time of this tragedy.</p>



<p>He explained to Page Six that he met the artist at a music studio the week he passed because they had plans to work on a new album together</p>



<p>“He didn’t seem okay,” Helgeson says now, elaborating as follows: </p>



<p>“He didn’t seem okay <em>physically</em> … [but] mentally, he was the most excited I’ve seen him in months. </p>



<p>&#8220;He was very intelligent and he was very conscious of what people wanted to see from him.”</p>

<p>There are no plans at the moment to release any new music from Carter.</p>



<p>In September, Carter shared with the public that he had checked himself into an outpatient program in order to try and regain custody of his son Prince, whom he shared with on-again, off-again fiancé, Melanie Martin.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carters-fiancee-breaks-silence-on-tragic-death-of-young-singer/">Said Martin in the wake of losing Carter</a>:</p>



<p>“I love Aaron with all my heart and it’s going to be a journey to raise a son without a father. Please respect the privacy of my family as we come to terms with the loss of someone we love greatly. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are still in the process of accepting this unfortunate reality. Your thoughts and prayers are greatly appreciated.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-was-his-death-a-suicide/">Aaron Carter was found dead</a> in the bathroom of his Lancaster, California home, but fans still have more questions than answers.</p>



<p>We have little in the way of official information about the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">cause of Carter&#8217;s death</a>, and it seems that for the singer&#8217;s loved ones, the situation is about the become even more complicated.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/13/aaron-carter-died-dead-without-will-son-inherit-assets-prince/">new report</a> from TMZ, Aaron did not have a will when he died, which means that his entire estate is up for grabs.</p>



<p>In many cases, that would mean difficult times and rocky legal battles ahead for the surviving family.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Aaron Carter is just hanging out and relaxing in a car in this Instagram photo. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But for two very big reasons, the Carters probably won&#8217;t end up duking it out in court with Aaron&#8217;s fiancée, Melanie Martin:</p>



<p>Aaron and Melanie welcomed their first child together last year, and legal experts say Prince &#8212; who will soon celebrate his first birthday &#8212; stands to inherit his father&#8217;s entire estate.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not a whole lot to inherit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the other reason Aaron&#8217;s lack of a will won&#8217;t create many problems for his family:</p>



<p>According to TMZ, the former child star was living a &#8220;hand to mouth&#8221; existence in the months before his death.</p>



<p>Carter earned millions over the course of his career, but he had not had much work in recent years, and it seems that his mortgage and other monthly expenses devoured what was left of his savings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The circumstances surrounding the death of Aaron Carter remain mysterious. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Aaron was reportedly living off of meager royalties checks and whatever money he earned from Cameo and the occasional sponsored content deal.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there should be some money waiting for Prince once the dust settles.</p>



<p>Aaron&#8217;s house was on the market at the time of his death, and the boy will reportedly receive 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/hilary-duff-blasts-allegations-about-sexual-relationship-with-aaron-carter-you-people-are-sick/">Carter had also completed work on a memoir</a> just months before his death.</p>



<p>The book was originally slated for release on November 15, but the date has been pushed back out of respect for Aaron&#8217;s family.</p>



<p>While there was a time when project might have been dismissed as just another celebrity tell-all, it will likely enjoy robust sales in the wake of the singer&#8217;s death, which means more money for Prince.</p>

<p>Insiders say Carter was hard at work rebuilding his music career at the time of his death, but sadly, he was unable to complete his final album.</p>



<p>Making the situation even more tragic are reports that Aaron hoped to heal the divisions within his family with lyrics in which he apologized to his brother Nick and others he had hurt in recent years.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the long-suffering Carter clan will soon be able to find some peace.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been almost a week since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-burdened-by-trauma-tragedy-before-death/">Aaron Carter was found dead</a> in the bathroom of his Lancaster, California home.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed/">cause of Carter&#8217;s death</a> is still undetermined, but it&#8217;s widely believed that the former child star suffered a fatal overdose.</p>



<p>Medical examiners are still awaiting the results of a toxicology test, but police say they found prescription bottles and cans of compressed air near the body.</p>



<p>Carter was reportedly was reportedly in the habit of huffing household cleaners to get high.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The coroner&#8217;s report will likely corroborate the prevailing theory that Carter&#8217;s death was the result of a multiple drug toxicity.</p>



<p>But this is 2022, which means that thousands of internet randos feel the need to offer their own theories about how Aaron died.</p>



<p>Many believe that Carter took his own life, despite the fact that there&#8217;s zero evidence to support those claims.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>The circumstances surrounding the death of Aaron Carter remain mysterious. Now, a close friend of Aaron&#8217;s is offering new insights. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>And now, an even more baseless and damaging claim is making the rounds on social media.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/11/aaron-carter-fiancee-melanie-martin-harassment/">new report</a> from TMZ, a growing contingent of Aaron&#8217;s fans are convinced that the singer was murdered by his on-again, off-again fiancée, Melanie Martin.</p>



<p>Melanie and Aaron&#8217;s relationship was notoriously contentious, and both parties struggled with addiction and mental health issues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&#8217;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>That said, there&#8217;s zero evidence that she had anything to do with his death, and Martin was <em>not</em> in the house at the time of Carter&#8217;s passing.</p>



<p>But that hasn&#8217;t stopped social media users from hurling wildly dangerous accusations at the mother of Aaron&#8217;s infant son.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m calling it, Melanie murdered Aaron,&#8221; wrote one Twitter user.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;She texted him days ago saying &#8216;you’re going to die&#8217; and days ago Aaron called her Voldemort. Today Melanie posts on social media a vid of her crying while driving! Who does that??? Suspicious!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Melanie paid the housekeeper to kill Aaron,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>In response to news that Martin requested a police escort to protect her while she retrieved items she had left behind in Aaron&#8217;s house, several conspiracy theorists accused her of suspicious behavior.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The irony of the situation is that Melanie was reportedly working tirelessly to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/aaron-carter-heres-how-his-ex-fiancee-nearly-saved-his-life/">try and save Aaron&#8217;s life</a> in the weeks leading up to his death, and she succeeded in convincing him to participate in an outpatient rehab program.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the people accusing her of murder are receiving a good deal of pushback from more level-headed observers. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is disgusting you should be ashamed,&#8221; one Twitter user argued in response to an allegation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;She was begging him to get sober otherwise &#8216;you’re going to die&#8217; as in he would OD if he didn’t stop and she was begging for her child’s father to live. You just spit in the face of every Addicts partner or parent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sometime in the next few weeks, Aaron&#8217;s official cause of death will be made public.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we encourage all who feel compelled to comment on the situation to bear in mind that his loved ones are grieving human beings going through a very difficult time.</p>
