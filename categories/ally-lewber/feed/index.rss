<p>Back in December, former <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-get-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Kennedy was arrested on domestic violence charges</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, his then-girlfriend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/ally-lewber-opens-up-about-explosive-final-fight-with-james-kennedy-reveals-he-had-been-drinking-behind-my-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ally Lewber, ended their relationship</a>.</p>



<p>Ally says she was not physically injured during the incident that led to James&#8217; arrest.</p>



<p>However, she says that despite previous claims that he&#8217;d quit drinking, he became drunk and belligerent. And according to a police report, she told officers that her “boyfriend lifted her up and threw her to the ground.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, Ally made the right call in kicking James to the curb.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ally-says-lisa-vanderpump-tried-to-convince-her-to-forgive-james">Ally says Lisa Vanderpump tried to convince her to forgive James</h2>



<p>But despite the fact that the relationship obviously needed to end, Ally says that after she moved out on James, she received a call from Lisa Vanderpump, who urged her to take him back.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was basically like, ‘Ally, like, he needs you … you’re really good together,’” Ally told Nick Viall on his &#8220;Viall Files&#8221; podcast this week (via <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/04/09/ally-lewber-claims-lisa-vanderpump-tried-to-convince-her-to-forgive-james-kennedy-following-the-vanderpump-rules-stars-domestic-violence-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>).</p>



<p>She added that Lisa “was trying to convince [her] to stay with [James]” and gaslit her by pointing out that both parties were drinking on the night of Kennedy&#8217;s arrest (Ally, unlike James, has no history of violence and is not an alcoholic).</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="854" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-1024x854.jpg" alt="James Kennedy and Ally Lewber arrive at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival at T-Mobile Arena on September 20, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada." class="wp-image-523143" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-1024x854.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-300x250.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-768x641.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-2048x1708.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-960x801.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-1080x901.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2173472586-1-1200x1001.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Kennedy and Ally Lewber arrive at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival at T-Mobile Arena on September 20, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images for iHeartRadio)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lisa even went so far as to try to convince Ally to accompany James on a slate of DJ-ing gigs he&#8217;d scheduled before his arrest.</p>



<p>“I’m like, first of all, what shows? He’s canceled right now,” Ally said (the gigs were, indeed, canceled). “And also, no. I just moved into an apartment … we’re not together.”</p>



<p>Ally says she believes that Lisa feels protective of James despite his many years of problematic behavior, But she also believes that as a producer on the show that made him famous Lisa was also “trying to, quite literally, produce” drama.</p>



<p>“She’s very protective over James,” Ally said. “I get it, because I was, too, for a long time,”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lisa-vanderpump-s-long-history-of-being-wrong">Lisa Vanderpump&#8217;s long history of being wrong</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jax-taylor-slams-lisa-vanderpump-for-defending-james-kennedys-alleged-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa has been defending James&#8217; abusive behavior</a> for years, and she&#8217;s been called out by everyone from Jax Taylor to Nick Viall.</p>



<p>In a bizarre interview with <em><a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/02/07/kristen-doute-slams-lisa-vanderpump-for-enabling-james-kennedys-abusive-behavior-absolutely-disgustingly-diabolical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>, Lisa insisted that James “didn’t hurt [Ally] categorically,” and insisted that Ally “regrets what happened with how this blew up.”</p>



<p>Lisa also blamed Ally for the conflict, explaining that she and James were “both being ridiculous and arguing” and  insisting that she had him arrested to “teach him a lesson.”</p>



<p>James previous exes, Kristen Doute and Raquel Leviss, have both accused him of abusive behavior. Ally says that James convinced her during their relationship that his exes were lying &#8212; but she now sees the light.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s so hard, because James has been in my ear– not now, but for our relationship, obviously– and I’ve heard a lot from the rest of the cast,” she said. “Mutually, that was just a very toxic relationship on both parties, so I don’t really want to say anything, but I will say that– and I have to say this, but also, it’s true– I will always believe women.”</p>

<p>Back in December of 2024, former <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-get-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Kennedy was arrested on domestic violence charges</a>.</p>



<p>The arrest occurred after James and girlfriend Ally Lewber left a holiday party hosted by fellow Bravo personality Kathy Hilton.</p>



<p>James, whose struggles with alcoholism have been well-documented, had reportedly been drinking at the party.</p>



<p>Now, Ally is opening up for the first time about the fateful night that changed both of their lives forever.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ally-stands-by-her-decision-to-part-ways-with-james">Ally stands by her decision to part ways with James</h2>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ally-lewber-remains-separated-from-james-kennedy-despite-his-desperate-attempts-to-win-her-back-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ally broke up with James</a> following the events of last December.</p>



<p>And in a new interview with <em><a href="https://people.com/ally-lewber-speaks-out-for-first-time-about-ex-james-kennedy-arrest-exclusive-11710871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> magazine, she reveals for the first time exactly what happened that night &#8212; and why she felt the need to move on.</p>



<p>“When I was finished working and came out to the party, that’s when it was like, ‘Oh, his whole demeanor changed,’” she recalled. </p>



<p>“And I could kind of tell, like, ‘Have you been drinking?’”</p>

<p>Ally says she quickly realized that Kennedy had been “drinking behind [her] back&#8221; even though he was aware that “drinking was a non-negotiable” in their relationship.</p>



<p>She says they left the party together, but the conflict between them escalated during their Uber ride home.</p>



<p>“It just kind of spiraled,” Ally said. “The tension was high. … He was still gaslighting me. He’s like, ‘I’m not drunk, you’re drunk.’ And I’m like, ‘No.’</p>



<p>“We were just fighting, and then when we got out of the Uber, the fighting just continued,” she continued. “I was like, ‘I don’t want to be here.’ We were just fighting outside.”</p>

<p>Despite the claims of domestic violence, Lewber says she was not harmed, and her testimony was instrumental in the decision to drop the charges.</p>



<p>“I was not hurt physically,” she claimed. “Emotionally, yes. But yeah, that’s kind of how that night played out, unfortunately.”</p>



<p>As for her decision to<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/ally-lewber-moves-out-of-home-she-shared-with-james-kennedy-following-domestic-violence-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> move out on James</a> before officially breaking up, Ally says ended the relationship gradually in order to better protect herself.</p>



<p>“I was still just trying to regulate his emotions and not upset him and upset myself,” she admitted. </p>

<p>Ally credits her therapist with helping her realize the “great” relationship “wasn’t real” because Kennedy was “lying” about drinking again.</p>



<p>Lewber&#8217;s father died from alcohol-related health issues when she was just 11. Looking back, she feels that she was “trying to save” her father through her relationship with Kennedy.</p>



<p>These days, she says she&#8217;s looking to date someone “who is already whole and complete.”</p>



<p>“[I want] someone that checks my boxes but is also like, ‘We can take things slow,&#8217;” Ally explained.</p>



<p>We wish her all the best as she moves forward.</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is no stranger to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Over the course of his eight seasons on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax boozed</a>, cheated, berated his co-stars, and made just about every kind of bad decision under the sun.</p>



<p>Not many people are surprised, that <a href="http://thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax&#8217;s marriage to Brittany Cartwright didn&#8217;t last</a>, but the Bravo veteran &#8212; who currently appears on <em>The Valley</em> &#8212; swears he&#8217;s changed his ways.</p>



<p>And in an ironic twist that no one saw coming, Jax is now passing moral judgment on his former VPR costars.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lisa-vanderpump-s-surprising-stance-on-james">Lisa Vanderpump&#8217;s surprising stance on James</h2>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-breaks-silence-on-domestic-violence-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Kennedy was arrested</a> back in December following an incident at Kathy Hilton&#8217;s holiday party.</p>



<p>He wasn&#8217;t charged, but the altercation led to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ally-lewber-confirms-james-kennedy-split-admits-yes-he-assaulted-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of James&#8217; relationship with Ally Lewber</a>.</p>



<p>We might never know for sure exactly what happened, but it sounds like James &#8212; whose substance abuse and anger issues have been well-documented &#8212; got up to his old tricks.</p>



<p>Which is why it was so surprising when his old boss, Lisa Vanderpump, came to his defense.</p>

<p>“I have spoken to James and to Ally at great length,” she told <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lisa-vanderpump-addresses-james-kennedys-domestic-violence-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> in the wake of the incident.</p>



<p>“I didn’t need to just hear from James. I needed to hear from Ally, too, from her mouth what happened. She told me categorically he didn’t hurt her. He never hurts her. They were both drinking.”</p>



<p>Lisa added that Ally only had James arrested because she wanted to &#8220;teach him a lesson.&#8221;</p>



<p>“She basically said, ‘Oh yes, take him away. It’ll teach him a lesson,&#8217;” Vanderpump told <em>Us</em>. “But no, he didn’t hurt her categorically. … She regrets what happened with how this blew up.”</p>

<p>Asked about his relationship with Lisa during a recent appearance on the &#8220;When Reality Hits&#8221; podcast, Jax made it clear that he&#8217;s not a fan of the West Hollywood restaurateur.</p>



<p>“No, I don’t talk to her anymore. To be honest with you, I don’t really take kindly to her,” he said (via <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/02/21/jax-taylor-slams-lisa-vanderpump-for-her-treatment-of-kristen-doute-ally-lewber-while-defending-james-kennedy-after-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>).</p>



<p>He explained that he was shocked that Lisa would defend James, who was previously in a toxic relationship with Jax&#8217;s <em>Vanderpump</em> co-star Kristen Doute.</p>



<p>“The way she treated Kristen, the things she said about Kristen and her lack of empathy,” Jax said.</p>

<p>“The way she handled the James and Ally situation. I personally think that was wrong. Kristen is my dear friend and the things [Lisa] said was just not OK.”</p>



<p>Kristen previously slammed Lisa&#8217;s comments as &#8220;absolutely disgusting and diabolical.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some fans were surprised by the news that Jax is not on speaking terms with Lisa, as she serves as an executive producer on The Valley.</p>



<p>“It’s a spinoff, so [Lisa] will always get a credit that’s how tv works,” he claimed in <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/01/09/fans-slam-jax-taylor-for-continuing-to-take-credit-for-creating-the-valley-jax-insists-lisa-vanderpump-has-no-part-of-the-show-despite-being-an-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a>.</p>



<p>That might be the case &#8212; but then again, Jax doesn&#8217;t have the greatest history when it comes to telling the truth, so who knows?</p>

<p>Ally Lewber has finally opened up.</p>



<p>Amid rumors that she had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ally-lewber-remains-separated-from-james-kennedy-despite-his-desperate-attempts-to-win-her-back-report/">ended her relationship with James Kennedy</a>, the Vanderpump Rules star issued a statement on Thursday that confirmed the following:</p>



<p>Yes, the romance is over.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1005" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1005x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517528" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1005x1024.jpg 1005w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-294x300.jpg 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-768x783.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-2010x2048.jpg 2010w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-942x960.jpg 942w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1060x1080.jpg 1060w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2185867886-1178x1200.jpg 1178w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Kennedy and Ally Lewber attend Giorgio Armani And FIAT Event In Beverly Hills at Giorgio Armani on November 20, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for FIAT)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for all your support and kindness,&#8221; Lewber wrote in a post shared to her Instagram Stories yesterday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am happy that prosecutors decided not to file against James as I never desired criminal charges. We had an argument outside of his home related to him drinking again, however, I was not physically hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>This statement marked the first time Lewber addressed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-get-the-details/">Kennedy&#8217;s arrest for domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>And certainly the first time she confessed to being the victim.</p>

Rodriguez/Getty Images for DailyMail.com)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The astrologer admitted she was &#8220;shocked by the headlines and disheartened by how the event was portrayed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lewber also addressed speculation over her status with Kennedy by stating for the social media record:</p>



<p>&#8220;We are no longer together, but I&#8217;ll always support James and wish him the best with his sobriety and healing. Thank you for your understanding.&#8221;</p>



<p>On December 10, Kennedy was arrested after the Burbank Police Department was called to his Los Angeles home &#8220;regarding an argument between a man and a woman,&#8221; a police spokesperson confirmed at the time to various outlets.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old has not publicly spoken out about his break-up with Lewber. </p>



<p>However, his lawyer said on January 22 that James is &#8220;continuing to focus on his sobriety and his DJ career&#8221; after prosecutors declined to move forward with his case.</p>



<p>Lewber, who had been dating Kennedy since 2021, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/ally-lewber-moves-out-of-home-she-shared-with-james-kennedy-following-domestic-violence-arrest/">moved out of the former couple&#8217;s shared home</a> last month.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been pretty clear for awhile now that the future was bleak.</p>



<p>&#8220;There were no grounds for any charges to be filed against Mr. Kennedy,&#8221; his attorney said in a statement to E! News, adding that the the reality star &#8220;is grateful to have this matter behind him.&#8221;</p>



<p>And now, meanwhile, he also has his relationship with Ally Lewber behind him. We wish these two the best moving forward.</p>

<p>Last month, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> alum <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-get-the-details/">James Kennedy was arrested</a> on domestic violence charges following an incident at a party hosted by fellow Bravo star Kathy Hilton.</p>



<p>The alleged victim was not identified at the time, and the exact nature of the incident is still unclear.</p>



<p>But whatever happened, it had a profound impact on James&#8217; relationship with longtime girlfriend Ally Lewber.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-james-kennedy-and-ally-lewber-appear-to-grow-apart">James Kennedy and Ally Lewber Appear to Grow Apart</h2>



<p>About a week after James&#8217; arrest, Ally began the process of moving out of the home they had shared.</p>



<p>And earlier this week, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/18/ally-lewber-taking-bags-from-james-kennedy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reported that James and Ally both looked &#8220;very unhappy&#8221; as they were spotted moving <em>more</em> of her belongings out of his house.</p>



<p>Now, a new report from <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/13348643/vanderpump-rules-james-kennedy-ally-lewber-broken-up-arrest/">The Sun</a></em> alleges that James and Ally have basically called it quits.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-1024x683.jpg" alt="James Kennedy and Ally Lewber attend The Brent Shapiro Foundation's Summer Spectacular 2023 at The Beverly Hilton on September 30, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California." class="wp-image-517499" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1710979144-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">James Kennedy and Ally Lewber attend The Brent Shapiro Foundation&#8217;s Summer Spectacular 2023 at The Beverly Hilton on September 30, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images for The Brent Shapiro Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A source tells the outlet that James and Ally “still talk and check in with each other, but Ally is still living her own life” after moving out.</p>



<p>“She’s focusing on her own peace and healing and her astrology career, and James is not her priority right now,” the insider said.</p>



<p>“He is desperately pleading with her to take him back, and she hasn’t fully pulled the trigger yet, but it’s headed in that direction of her walking away.”</p>

<p>The source explains that Ally&#8217;s time away from James has “made her realize he’s not healthy for her and it’s better for both of them if they broke up for good.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-history-of-rage">A History of Rage</h2>



<p>As <em>Vanderpump</em> viewers know, James&#8217; problems with anger and alcohol have been welll-documented over the years.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been no word yet on whether James &#8212; who has quit drinking several times in recent years &#8212; consumed any alcohol on the night of Hilton&#8217;s party.</p>

<p>There are conflicting reports about the incident that led to Kennedy&#8217;s arrest, but <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/01/22/celebrity-news/james-kennedy-ally-lewber-all-but-broken-up-after-arrest/">Page Six</a> has confirmed that the DJ and former reality star was &#8220;taken away in cuffs and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence before being released on $20,000 bail.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neither party has publicly revealed any specifics about the incident, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/ally-lewber-has-something-to-say-about-boyfriend-james-kennedys-arrest/">Ally issued a statement</a> thanking fans for their support.</p>



<p>“Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me,” she wrote.</p>

<p>We still don&#8217;t know if James will face charges for the incident, but it seems that the events of that night have had a major impact on his relationship.</p>



<p>Neither James nor Ally has yet offered up any specifics about the events leading up to the arrest.</p>

<p>But she did post a statement in which she thanked fans for their support during this difficult time. </p>



<p>And now, it looks as though Ally has decided to move out of the home she had been sharing with James.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Ally is moving out permanently or if this is just a temporary break.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the Ohio native has assured her loved ones that she&#8217;s not in any danger.</p>



<p>“Ally has been telling friends she’s doing OK. She’s definitely safe and not in danger with James,&#8221; an insider tells Page Six.</p>

<p>“I’m OK and taking the time I need right now,” she wrote on Instagram. “I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.”</p>

<p>No charges have been filed, and Ally has been named as the victim.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-james-kennedy">What&#8217;s Next For James Kennedy?</h2>



<p>James has yet to personally speak out on the matter.</p>



<p>But earlier today, his attorneys issued a statement on his behalf, and it seems they&#8217;re trying to convince the DA&#8217;s office not to file charges.</p>



<p>“We are in the process of conducting our own investigation into the allegations levied by the Burbank Police Department against James,” attorneys for Kennedy said, according to <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vprs-james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>. </p>

<p>“We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that, after careful review, the city’s attorneys will decide not to file formal charges.”</p>



<p>During a 2023 episode of her podcast, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/scheana-shay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scheana Shay</a> asked Ally about rumors that James had assaulted her in a car after the MTV TV &amp; Movie Awards.</p>



<p>“That’s crazy to me that that’s the most asked question [for me]. That makes me really sad, because no, I’m good. That never happened. There was no physical altercation,” she said (via <em>Us Weekly</em>). </p>

<p>“Yes, we were in the car together. I thought we were having fun. We were having fun. But then James and I did get into an argument, but there was no physical assault,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was not bleeding, and they didn’t have to get out of the car and separate us. So that didn’t happen. That’s all I’ll say on that.”</p>

<p>Ally has confirmed that James is still working on himself, including his &#8220;anger issues.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>When did it start? How brazen were their PDAs? Did they really think they could get away with it?</em></p>



<p>These were the questions on the minds of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> fans when they first learned of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/tom-sandoval-tried-to-convince-his-family-to-accept-raquel-leviss-but-they-werent-having-it/">affair between Tom Sandoval and Raquel Leviss</a>.</p>



<p>And now, after weeks of hearsay and speculation, we&#8217;re finally getting an objective account of the scandal through the eyes of a Bravo camera crew.</p>



<p>Yes, last night&#8217;s episode of VPR offered the series&#8217; first hints at the emergence of the Scandoval.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The episode was filmed back in late August, a time when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/tom-sandoval-was-obsessed-with-raquel-leviss-before-affair-seethed-with-jealousy-when-she-hooked-up-with-schwartz/">Raquel had recently hooked up with Tom<em> Schwartz</em></a>, and no one on the cast suspected that she would soon wrap her long limbs around Tom Sandoval.</p>



<p>No one, that is, except for James Kennedy&#8217;s girlfriend Ally Lewber, who spied Leviss and Raquel on the dance floor late at night and had the good sense to suspect that something might be up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ally Lewber is James Kennedy&#8217;s girlfriend. And apparently, she&#8217;s quite the detective! (Photo via Instagram)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;I saw Sandoval and Raquel dancing together at The Abbey,&#8221; she recalled in a confessional. </p>



<p>&#8220;I personally wouldn&#8217;t be comfortable with it, I guess, to have my boyfriend out at 1 a.m. with girls. But everyone&#8217;s different,&#8221; Lewber continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it was kind of weird,&#8221; Ally told James, adding, &#8220;It was like 1 a.m. and we were like, &#8216;Where is Ariana?'&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Folks, this is the reality TV equivalent of the moment in history when someone said, <em>Hey, what are those guys snooping around the Watergate Hotel so late at night?</em></p>



<p>James was dismissive, figuring &#8212; as everyone did in those days &#8212; that Leviss had her eye on Schwartz.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed how much Raquel&#8217;s been hanging out with the Toms, both of them,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put too much to it.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Adding to the smokescreen was the fact that Raquel was about to go on her first real date with Oliver Beauvais.</p>



<p>That turned into a mini-scandal of its own, as Oliver was accused of lying to Raquel when he claimed that he was separated from his wife.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s a tough reason for any other <em>Vanderpump</em> subplot (sorry, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/scheana-shay-and-brock-davies-married/">Scheana&#8217;s wedding</a>!) because viewers really only care about the Scandoval.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Raquel has done a lot of crying this season. (Photo via Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Fortunately, this thing is so big that just about every cast member is involved in one way or another.</p>



<p>Later in the episode, Raquel took a seat between Tom and Tom during her shift at SUR.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you like it so much?&#8221; Lisa Vanderpump asked Sandoval. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a smile on your face.&#8221;</p>



<p>Little did she know!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&#8211;</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The episode ended on a foreshadowing note, as things got tense in a conversation between Sandoval and Katie Maloney.</p>



<p>“You get a lot of joy out of Raquel as well,” Katie said to Sandoval at Lala&#8217; birthday party. “You go to The Abbey together at one o’clock in the morning.”</p>



<p>“Dude, what the f—k are you even saying? Get the f—k out of here, man,&#8221; Tom shot back.</p>



<p>Folks, those are the words of a man who knows he&#8217;s been busted big time.</p>

<p>A new season of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> is almost upon us, and with it comes the usual blend of <em>Housewives</em>-level drama and <em>Jersey Shore</em>-caliber comedy that&#8217;s made the series so popular for the past decade.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a longtime fan, then you know that the show underwent some major changes before its ninth season.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/faith-stowers-trashes-stassi-schroeder-shes-white-shes-privilege/">Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute were fired </a>amid a messy scandal inviolving former part-time cast member Faith Stowers.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright were also let go.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Fans were concerned that <em>Vanderpump</em> wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive without three of its most beloved original cast members.</p>



<p>After all, it&#8217;s tough for any reality show that&#8217;s been around since the Obama years to remain fresh. </p>



<p>But thanks to some imaginative retooling and some bonkers real-life drama, the Pump Rules cast is still delivering the goods.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Check out the trailer for she show&#8217;s tenth season above!</p>



<p>As you can some things have remained the same (Schwartz and Sandy&#8217;s still hasn&#8217;t opened), but many, many things have changed.</p>



<p>For starters, there are the breakups, which won&#8217;t come as a surprise to folks who have been following the off-camera Vanderpump drama between seasons:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katie Maloney appears to be having a tough time on Vanderpump Rules Season 10. (Photo via Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>As we see in the trailer, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/katie-maloney-delves-into-divorce-details-this-is-why-i-had-to-s/">Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz have filed for divorce</a> (and it looks like Schwartz puts the blame on his struggling business venture, and, by extension, Tom Sandoval).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Lala Kent and Randall Emmett have gone their separate ways, as well &#8212; and it looks like Lala has had no difficulty in moving on.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s not all!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Raquel Leviss is single once again. (Photo via Bravo)</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>James Kennedy and Raquel Leviss have called off their engagement, and it looks as though the aftermath of that breakup has yielded considerable drama.</p>



<p>Kennedy&#8217;s new girlfriend, Ally Lewber, will be joining the cast this season, and it seems that like just about everyone else, she prefers the sober version of DJ James.</p>



<p>(And based on Ally&#8217;s comments in the trailer, it&#8217;s safe to assume that James is no longer on the wagon.)</p>

<p></p>



<p>And is if that wasn&#8217;t enough upheaval for one season, it looks as though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/katie-maloney-tom-schwartz-is-banging-raquel-leviss-and-its-all-scheana-shays-fault/">Raquel is now hooking up with Schwartz</a>.</p>



<p>You know when a sitcom like <em>Friends</em> has been on for a crazy long time, and the writers run out of ideas, so random characters just start hooking up?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening on <em>Vanderpump</em> Season 10, but it&#8217;s all unscripted!</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Adding to this season&#8217;s slew of surprises is the return of Kristina Kelly &#8212; who was a semi-regular in the show&#8217;s early seasons &#8212; and the demotion of Brock Davies.</p>



<p>Yes, even though this season will feature Brock and Scheana&#8217;s wedding, it seems the controversial Aussie has been bumped down to &#8220;friend of the cast&#8221; status.</p>



<p>So yeah, needless to say, there&#8217;s a lot to keep track of as <em>Vanderpump</em> enters its double-digit era.</p>



<p>Whatever other criticism you might have for the show, you certainly can&#8217;t argue that it&#8217;s grown stale!</p>



<p><em>Vanderpump Rules</em> Season 10 will premiere on Bravo on February 8!</p>
