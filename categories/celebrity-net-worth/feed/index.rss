<p>John Cena has been a household name for years now &#8212; and he&#8217;s got the net worth to prove it.</p>



<p>After getting his start in the WWE, Cena made the difficult leap to mainstream Hollywood fame.</p>



<p>And after nearly three decades in the public eye, the charismatic star has built up quite an impressive financial portfolio.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-john-cena-s-net-worth">What is John Cena&#8217;s net worth?</h2>



<p>According to the website <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/wrestlers/john-cena-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Cena is worth approximately $80 million.</p>



<p>Not bad for a guy who started out as a wrestler during a time when that sector of the entertainment world was not taken seriously by the mainstream.</p>



<p>Of course, for all of his abilities in the ring, Cena&#8217;s continued earning power stems mainly from his acting talent on screen.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-683x1024.jpg" alt="John Cena attends the screening of 20th Century Fox's &quot;Ferdinand&quot; at Zanuck Theater at 20th Century Fox Lot on December 10, 2017 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-520849" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-889527436-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">John Cena attends the screening of 20th Century Fox&#8217;s &#8220;Ferdinand&#8221; at Zanuck Theater at 20th Century Fox Lot on December 10, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like the Rock and Dave Bautista, Cena has achieved what once looked to be impossible:</p>



<p>He made the leap from wrestling stardom to success in Hollywood.</p>



<p>Thanks to roles in action projects like <em>Bumblebee</em> and comedies like <em>Vacation Friends</em> and last year&#8217;s <em>Ricky Stanicky</em>, Cena has become one of the film industry&#8217;s most in-demand talents.</p>



<p>He continues to pop up in unexpected places, such as when he made a memorable guest appearance on the Emmy-winning FX series <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/jeremy-allen-white-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bear</a></em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-644584892-1024x681.jpg" alt="John Cena, WWE Superstar, hosts Nintendo Switch in Unexpected Places for the Nintendo Switch system on February 23, 2017 at Blue Cloud Movie Ranch in Santa Clarita, California.

<p>What&#8217;s more impressive than Cena&#8217;s earnings is the fact that he&#8217;s developed genuine acting chops.</p>



<p>He might not be as popular a leading man as the Rock, but<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/john-cena-naked-oscars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> his comedic skills</a> have made him the kind of character actor who Hollywood just can&#8217;t get enough of.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-vast-and-varied-resume">A vast and varied resume</h2>



<p>Cena continues to seek out a wide array of professional experiences.</p>



<p>In addition to his endorsements of everything from Hefty garbage bags to Fruity Pebbles (a sly reference to his in-ring feud with the Rock), he&#8217;s active in projects that appeal to wrestling fans and gamers.</p>

<p>WWE founder Vince McMahon memorably referred to Cena as &#8220;<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2705288-vince-mcmahon-calls-john-cena-the-babe-ruth-of-wwe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrestling&#8217;s Babe Ruth</a>,&#8221; crediting him as the figure who brought the sport a new level of mainstream visibility.</p>



<p>Cena&#8217;s charisma has introduced him to fans who may have previously had zero interest in the world of wrestling.</p>



<p>And his effortless comedic skills have made it clear that he&#8217;ll continue to be a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.</p>



<p>At the moment, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up next for John Cena. But you can be sure that the man who coined the &#8220;you can&#8217;t see me&#8221; catchphrase is not planning to disappear anytime soon.</p>

<p>What is the net worth of Demi Moore?</p>



<p>From her early days starring in <em>St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire</em> to her <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2024/06/the-brat-pack-dissension-in-the-ranks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brat Pack</a> era to her much more recent full-frontal<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/demi-moore-full-frontal-nude-the-substance-cannes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> nude scene in <em>The Substance</em></a>, she is a Hollywood legend.</p>



<p>She has worked for decades, costarred with and even married other A-listers, and entertained generations.</p>



<p>After all of that, we certainly <em>hope </em>that she&#8217;s rolling in dough.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-demi-moore-s-net-worth">What is Demi Moore&#8217;s net worth?</h2>



<p>According to online estimates &#8212; which we would always be wise to view as educated guesses &#8212; Demi Moore&#8217;s net worth is around $200 million in 2024.</p>



<p>That is an impressive fortune, even by A-list actor standards.</p>



<p>Her wealth makes her a standout. But then, so does her career, her beauty, and her acting talent.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Demi Moore in May of 2024." class="wp-image-501649" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the Red Carpet of the closing ceremony at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival at Palais des Festivals on May 25, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Demi Moore was born in 1962 in Roswell. Even the small roles that she enjoyed at the start of her career were in memorable projects, like <em>Blame It on Rio</em> and <em>St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire</em>.</p>



<p>However, she truly rose to household name status in her 1990 breakout role in <em>Ghost</em>. In that film, which changed the way that people view pottery wheels forever, she starred opposite Patrick Swayze as his still-living love.</p>



<p>That netted Demi her first Golden Globe nomination. It also set her down her blazing path of Hollywood fame.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-else-did-demi-moore-gain-her-nine-figure-fortune">How else did Demi Moore gain her nine-figure fortune?</h2>



<p>To be clear, Demi Moore was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood in the 1990s. Her pay for <em>Striptease </em>was $12.5 million &#8212; a value which has doubled by 2024 standards.</p>



<p>She raked in millions for other projects, including $5 million for the legendary <em>Indecent Proposal</em>.</p>



<p>During her busiest acting years, she raked in an estimated $60 million. Decades later, that would be $100 million in value.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="705" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-705x1024.jpg" alt="Demi Moore at the end of May in 2024." class="wp-image-501651" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-705x1024.jpg 705w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-206x300.jpg 206w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-768x1116.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-1409x2048.jpg 1409w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-660x960.jpg 660w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-743x1080.jpg 743w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-826x1200.jpg 826w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0611_demimoore_04-scaled.jpg 1761w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Demi Moore attends the FYC red carpet event For FX&#8217;s &#8220;FEUD: Capote Vs.

<p>Of course, Demi Moore&#8217;s net worth also stems from less exciting things.</p>



<p>For example, one of her A-lister ex-husbands is Bruce Willis. During their divorce, she received $90 million in both cash and marital property.</p>



<p>And speaking of real estate, she has made numerous investments &#8212; purchasing high end properties and selling them later. This isn&#8217;t just about Hollywood mansions and New York penthouses (though she has owned and sold both), but also properties in the midwest. Way to diversify!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demi-moore-was-part-of-the-brat-pack-and-participated-in-the-brats-documentary">Demi Moore was part of the Brat Pack, and participated in the &#8216;Brats&#8217; documentary</h2>



<p>As we have reported elsewhere, Hulu&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/06/10/brats-documentary-about-1980s-brat-pack-new-on-streaming-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Brats </em>documentary</a> became a viral hit over the summer of 2024.</p>



<p>Demi Moore participated in the documentary and attended the premiere.</p>



<p></p>



<p>This will, first and foremost, be a welcome wave of 1980s nostalgia for people who remember the &#8217;80s with fondness. Even younger people who just find the era fascinating might enjoy it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Demi Moore is an exception when it comes to many actors of that era. Many had careers interrupted &#8212; by scandals, by family, and more. Meanwhile, Demi remains iconic to multiple generations.</p>



<p>And now, she&#8217;s a first-time <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/oscar-nominations-2025/">Academy Award nominee</a> for her work on <em>The Substance</em>!</p>



<p>Obviously, Demi is a true Hollywood success story. </p>



<p>And she has the net worth to show for it.</p>

<p>Whether you know him as Roman Roy in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/brian-cox-responds-to-the-ultimate-succession-shocker-did-he-see-it-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Succession</a></em> or from his award-winning performance in <em>A Real Pain</em>, you&#8217;re probably aware that Kieran Culkin is one of the hottest talents in Hollywood these days.</p>



<p>But while he might be at the top of the heap these days, Kieran&#8217;s road to superstardom was anything but traditional.</p>



<p>After getting his start performing alongside his brother <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/macaulay-culkin-and-brenda-song-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macaulay</a> in <em>Home Alone</em>, Kieran moved on to more artistic, low-budget fare like <em>Igby Goes Down</em>.</p>



<p>And for much of his adult life, he&#8217;s kept a relatively low profile.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kieran Culkin attends The Gothams 34th Annual Film Awards at Cipriani Wall Street on December 02, 2024 in New York City." class="wp-image-520453" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2187929510-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kieran Culkin attends The Gothams 34th Annual Film Awards at Cipriani Wall Street on December 02, 2024 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result, even big-time fans of Kieran&#8217;s might be in the dark about the details of his personal life &#8212; including just how much he&#8217;s got in the bank.</p>



<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s delve into the details about the former child star&#8217;s financial situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-kieran-culkin-s-net-worth">What Is Kieran Culkin&#8217;s Net Worth</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/kieran-culkin-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kieran is worth roughly $5 million.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kieran Culkin attends the 31st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on February 23, 2025 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-520454" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2201573170-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kieran Culkin attends the 31st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on February 23, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s a sizable chunk of change for the average American. But it&#8217;s not all that much money by Hollywood standards.</p>



<p>But again, Kieran has walked a very non-traditional career path.</p>



<p>While he got his start, in blockbusters headlined by his older brother, these days, most of the buzz surrounding Kieran stems from his work in indie flicks like last year&#8217;s <em>A Real Pain</em>.</p>



<p>But while such projects might not bring in massive paychecks, they can still be hugely beneficial to an actor&#8217;s career (to say nothing of the potential for artistic fulfillment).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-for-kieran-culkin">A new era for Kieran Culkin</h2>



<p>After decades in the industry, Kieran is receiving more acclaim than ever before.</p>



<p>If <em>Succession</em> brought him a new level of fame, <em>A Real Pain</em> has brought him to an even higher level of awards season success and critical praise.</p>



<p>Tonight, Kieran has the potential to bring home his first Academy Award. And if he does, you can be certain that he&#8217;ll offer thanks to his wife, Jazz Charton, and their two kids.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a man who seems well aware that there are more important things in life than money.</p>

<p>Sami Sheen reportedly boasts a substantial net worth.</p>



<p>And while part of her wealth is undoubtedly the result of her parents being Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards, the income is all hers.</p>



<p>Shortly after turning 18, Sami signed up to be a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen-clash-over-daughter-sami-sheens-onlyfans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creator on OnlyFans</a>.</p>



<p>The results have been substantial, and she has reportedly made <em>millions </em>at the tender age of 20.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sami-sheen-has-reportedly-made-3-million-on-onlyfans">Sami Sheen has reportedly made $3 million on OnlyFans</h2>



<p>According to a new report by <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14434329/Sami-Sheen-millionaire-Denise-Richards-daughter-shares-bikini-snaps-making-3M-OnlyFans.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, Sami Sheen has raked in more than $3 million on OnlyFans.</p>



<p>“Sami has been killing it,&#8221; an insider characterized.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; that same insider then teased, &#8220;she is just getting started.” Fantastic!</p>



<p>It is only a bonus that Sami has used her platform to share positive messages and show <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/sami-sheen-drops-onlyfans-routine-plans-to-free-the-nipple-affirms-support-for-fellow-sex-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support for fellow sex workers</a>, including OnlyFans creators.

<p>As many have pointed out, Sami Sheen does not only have OnlyFans as a source of income.</p>



<p>Bravo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/denise-richards-sami-sheen-onlyfans-reality-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new reality series</a>, <em>Denise Richards &amp; Her Wild Things</em>, premieres on March 4. Sami is one of the stars, and is almost certainly receiving a paycheck.</p>



<p>She won&#8217;t be raking in the per-episode pay of a <em>Real Housewives</em> veteran. But a Bravo paycheck is pretty much always nice &#8212; especially if it&#8217;s effectively a side hustle.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-1024x576.png" alt="Denise Richards speaks to the camera." class="wp-image-519645" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0219_deniserichards_04.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On &#8216;Denise Richards &amp; Her Wild Things,&#8217; the titular actress speaks about the complex realities of parenting teen girls (and one young adult).<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-has-denise-richards-full-support-of-course">She has Denise Richards&#8217; full support, of course</h2>



<p>Though Denise has admitted that she didn&#8217;t fully know what OnlyFans was before Sami joined, she has championed her daughter&#8217;s right to sign up. After all, Sami is an adult. (Also, the sexist backlash helped to cement her support)</p>



<p>Denise also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/sami-sheen-breast-augmentation-has-denise-richards-support-she-can-do-what-she-wants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported Sami&#8217;s decision to get breast implants</a>. Sami had resolved to avoid going topless in any meaningful way on OnlyFans until after that procedure.</p>



<p>Sami may receive some pushback &#8212; including from sister Lola, who seems to have different values &#8212; but she&#8217;s clearly doing well for herself. Good for her.</p>

<p>MrBeast has a monumental net worth. But is he really a billionaire?</p>



<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/selena-gomez-net-worth-billionaire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible talents</a> become billionaires. Other times, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talentless dirtbags</a> accumulate colossal wealth with little rhyme or reason.</p>



<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jake-paul-net-worth-is-he-as-rich-as-brother-logan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealthy YouTubers</a>, things can go either way.</p>



<p>MrBeast is seldom controversial despite his name being everywhere. How rich has his larger-than-life YouTube empire made him?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-net-worth-of-mrbeast">What is the net worth of MrBeast?</h2>



<p>MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, was born in 1998. Barely old enough to rent a car, he has the wealth to <em>buy </em>a fleet of vehicles.</p>



<p>Multiple online <a href="https://www.finance-monthly.com/2024/12/mrbeast-net-worth-2024-1-billion-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> have described MrBest as a billionaire. Additionally, <em><a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/producers/jimmy-donaldson-aka-mrbeast-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a></em> estimates MrBeast as having a net worth of $1 billion as of January 2025.</p>



<p>MrBeast himself has previously acknowledged that he does not directly access his bank accounts. In addition to having a CFO, he has apparently entrusted his mother with access to his primary cash fund.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>With his estimated net worth of $1 billion, MrBeast seems to be the wealthiest YouTuber as of early 2025.</p>



<p>In 2024, he was the top content creator. In 2022, he was the highest paid content creator. </p>



<p>Both of those stats come by way of <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/mrbeast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a></em>, though the business magazine estimated his net worth to be in the &#8220;mere&#8221; 8-digits at the time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-money-does-mrbeast-make">How much money does MrBeast make?</h2>



<p>As for salary, MrBeast makes an estimated $50 million per month. If that is true, he could be raking in $600 million per year. </p>



<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, MrBeast has more or less confirmed that figure, as he allegedly makes $600 to $700 million per year from what he has told <em>Time</em>.</p>



<p>The YouTube behemoth rakes in massive numbers of viewers. We do not know precisely how much he makes per 100 million views. We do, however, know what MrBeast does with much of the money.</p>

<p>In addition to lavish giveaways and paying his small army of employees, MrBeast turns around a tremendous amount of money and puts it into </p>



<p>&#8220;Right now, whatever we make, we reinvest.” he previously told <em>Time</em>. “Each video does a couple million in ad revenue, a couple million in brand deals.&#8221;</p>



<p>MrBeast reported: &#8220;I’ve reinvested everything to the point of &#8212; you could claim &#8212; stupidity, just believing that we would succeed. And it’s worked out.”</p>

<p>He shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DESoQn4RgAl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> that he had popped the question, captioning the photo: &#8220;Ya boy did a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>One doesn&#8217;t have to enjoy his high-energy content (the target audience is arguably teens) to appreciate MrBeast&#8217;s monumental hefty net worth and continuing financial success.</p>

<p>What is Kenny Chesney&#8217;s net worth?</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/morgan-wallen-sober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some Country stars</a> make headlines for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-trump-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the worst reasons</a>, a longtime star in the genre is crossing a milestone.</p>



<p>Kenny Chesney is the first country performer, ever, to headline at the Las Vegas Sphere.</p>



<p>Naturally, fans and those unfamiliar with his work alike are wondering how wealthy his unending success has made him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="736" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-1024x736.jpg" alt="Kenny Chesney on October 11, 2023." class="wp-image-516975" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-1024x736.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-300x216.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-768x552.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-2048x1473.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-960x690.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-1080x777.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_01-1200x863.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kenny Chesney performs at the 53rd Anniversary Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame Gala at Music City Center on October 11, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-las-vegas-sphere-will-host-kenny-chesney">Las Vegas&#8217; Sphere will host Kenny Chesney </h2>



<p>Kenny Chesney will headline the Sphere from May 22 through June 13.</p>



<p>In fact, his <a href="https://www.kennychesney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">residency</a> could extend even further if it ends up being in high demand. That&#8217;s already happened with U2, Dead and Co., The Eagles, and Anyma. Thus far, only Phish has stuck to their initial Sphere commitment.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly what Chesney has planned. But whatever it is, it&#8217;s been in the works for months.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kenny Chesney on November 21, 2021." class="wp-image-516976" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kenny Chesney performs onstage for the 2021 Medallion Ceremony, celebrating the Induction of the Class of 2020 at Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on November 21, 2021.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I’m always looking for ways to deepen the way No Shoes Nation experiences this music,” Chesney shared in a statement.</p>



<p>“…just the idea of 4D technology and the impossibly dialed-in sound raises the experience for No Shoes Nation, literally immersing them in music, visuals, sound, and being together,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Chesney affirmed: &#8220;To me, this is going to be a whole new way of rocking the fans, and I can’t wait.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-kenny-chesney-s-net-worth">What is Kenny Chesney&#8217;s net worth?</h2>



<p>According to online estimates by Celebrity Net Worth, Kenny Chesney has a net worth of $180 million.</p>



<p>That is, of course, only an estimate. These online estimates are not the same as deep dives by <em>Forbes</em>, but represent educated guesses based upon publicly available information and knowledge of the industry.</p>



<p>Often, net worth estimates of the very wealthy &#8212; like Chesney clearly seems to be &#8212; can prove more accurate than guessing the wealth of a newer artist or, say, a TV character actor.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kenny Chesney on November 8, 2023." class="wp-image-516978" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kenny Chesney performs onstage during the 57th Annual CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena on November 08, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Terry Wyatt/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that Kenny Chesney is more successful than the vast majority of country stars. This goes beyond his net worth.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s won twelve Country Music Awards. And he has been a country star for decades.</p>



<p>In 2018, <em>Forbes </em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/kenny-chesney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> his annual income to be about $37 million. In this case, the $180 million estimate is believable, even without confirmation.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="826" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-1024x826.jpg" alt="Kenny Chesney on March 14, 2023." class="wp-image-516979" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-1024x826.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-300x242.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-768x620.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-2048x1653.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-960x775.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-1080x872.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0116_kennychesney_05-1200x968.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Singer and songwriter Kenny Chesney speaks onstage at the Omni Nashville Hotel on March 14, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-do-performers-make-at-the-sphere">How much do performers make at the Sphere?</h2>



<p>This sort of thing can vary widely from artist to artist.</p>



<p>However, U2 was reportedly making about $1 million per show at the Las Vegas Sphere.</p>



<p>If Kenny Chesney does the same or better (or even almost as well for himself), he could definitely add some comfortable padding to his net worth. After all, there are a lot of country fans in Vegas.</p>

<p>Lacey Chabert has an estimated net worth that&#8217;s a little lower than what some might expect.</p>



<p>Even though the acting veteran is a pillar of Hallmark projects, there was a time when higher ups <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/lacey-chabert-hallmark-old-talent-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to push out &#8220;old talent&#8221;</a> &#8212; and branded her as such.</p>



<p>Perhaps that lack of appreciation by those in charge is why she hasn&#8217;t reaped the full rewards of her years of work.</p>



<p>Fortunately, this seems to be changing with a slew of new projects. It&#8217;s no more than she deserves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-estimated-net-worth-of-lacey-chabert">What is the estimated net worth of Lacey Chabert?</h2>



<p>Online estimates on sites like <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/lacey-chabert-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> put Lacey Chabert&#8217;s net worth at around $4 million. That doesn&#8217;t mean that she has the 7-figure sum sitting around in a bank account.</p>



<p>Rather, net worth estimates represent everything &#8212; estimated property values, how much a private business might be sold for, and more. </p>



<p>A $4 million net worth would, for most people, be great. But some fans may find it odd that someone with decades of acting experience &#8212; and some very famous roles &#8212; has the same approximate wealth as a moderately successful dentist.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="819" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-1024x819.jpg" alt="Lacey Chabert on November 28, 2019." class="wp-image-518088" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-768x614.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-960x768.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-1080x864.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_02-1200x960.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Lacey Chabert visitâs &#8216;The IMDb Show&#8217; on October 7, 2019 in Studio City, California.

<p>Obviously, these online estimates can be extremely dubious. They are, after all, informed guesses &#8212; not the result of detailed run-downs like you&#8217;d get in a <em>Forbes </em>write-up.</p>



<p>Lacey Chabert should, one imagines, have a higher net worth. Many of us first saw her in the &#8217;90s, where she and Sarah Michelle Gellar portrayed the daughters of Erica Kane on <em>All My Children</em>. </p>



<p>But she&#8217;s done much more work, from one of the most iconic roles in <em>Mean Girls</em> to ample voice work &#8211; including Gwen Stacey on <em>The Spectacular Spider-Man</em>, Eliza Thornberry on <em>The Wild Thornberrys</em>, and Zatanna on <em>Young Justice</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-remember-lacey-chabert-is-a-hallmark-mainstay">Remember, Lacey Chabert is a Hallmark mainstay</h2>



<p>Over the years, Chabert has starred in over 30 Hallmark Christmas films &#8212; which is a lot of such films to exist at all, let alone star one phenomenal talent.</p>



<p>In 2024, she also premiered on <em>Celebrations with Lacey Chabert</em>, an unscripted Hallmark series where she simply throws celebrations for children, families, and adults who are making some sort of positive impact on their communities.</p>



<p>It is commonly believed that a Hallmark film probably pays out around $50,000 to $60,000 to one of its stars. Perhaps a bit more. Which means that it might qualify for a modest middle-class income if it&#8217;s an actor&#8217;s only project in a year, though some of that pay may go to agents, managers, and more.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="756" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-756x1024.jpg" alt="Lacey Chabert on August 22, 2025." class="wp-image-518090" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-756x1024.jpg 756w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-222x300.jpg 222w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-768x1040.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-1512x2048.jpg 1512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-709x960.jpg 709w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-797x1080.jpg 797w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-886x1200.jpg 886w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0129_laceychabert_04-scaled.jpg 1890w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Actress Lacey Chabert attends a private event at Hyde Staples Center hosted by Tommy Bahama during the Taylor Swift concert on August 22, 2015.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Merritt/Getty Images for Tommy Bahama)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, Lacey Chabert&#8217;s career extends to other projects. In late 2024, Netflix&#8217;s <em>Hot Frosty</em> became a hot topic.</p>



<p>Some reviewers on social media likened it to a Hallmark film, but one where the characters seemed more <em>human </em>in important ways.</p>



<p>More recently, Lacey Chabert signed a multi-picture deal with Hallmark. The 2022 agreement has her headlining and producing films and other projects for the network. Additionally, <em><a href="https://people.com/lacey-chabert-is-expanding-her-empire-at-hallmark-exclusive-8782141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> reports that Chabert&#8217;s line of products is going out through Hallmark stores in 2025 and beyond &#8212; and this deal could give her a solid financial boost.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-normal-for-hallmark-stars">Is this normal for Hallmark stars?</h2>



<p>No two actors share the exact same career. But <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/danica-mckellar-isnt-quitting-gaf-with-neal-bledsoe-i-dont-think-candace-cameron-bure-is-a-bigot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danicka McKellar</a> also spent years on Hallmark (and voiced a main character on <em>Young Justice</em>) and has a reported net worth of $8 million.</p>



<p>Some point to Candace Cameron Bure for her reported $14 million net worth. However, Cameron Bure was also a co-host and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-view-co-hosts-slam-critics-of-olympics-last-supper-drag-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary antagonist on <em>The View</em></a> for a while. Both women moved on to Great American Family, a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/neal-bledsoe-exits-gaf-network-following-candace-cameron-bures-homophobic-dogwhistle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial network</a> seemingly created for people who feel that Hallmark content is too <em>inclusive</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d all love to see Lacey Chabert have the net worth that her career warrants. But this is probably a good reminder that someone being on TV doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re set for life, or even set for the next six months.</p>

<p>We probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that 2024 was a banner year for Jake Paul.</p>



<p>After months of hype, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/mike-tyson-slaps-jake-paul-at-final-weigh-in-what-set-him-off/">Jake stepped into the ring with Mike Tyson</a> for what might&#8217;ve been the biggest event in Netflix history.</p>



<p>The fight itself wasn&#8217;t much to write home about &#8212; the combatants mostly just danced around each other, and technical issues interrupted the stream for millions of viewers &#8212; but both Paul and Tyson were handsomely rewarded for their efforts.</p>

<p>Seems a bit backward to us, but we don&#8217;t make the rules!</p>



<p>Never one to rest on his laurels for long Jake has now announced plans to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2025/01/28/jake-paul-logan-paul-march-max-stream/76795271007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">face off against his brother Logan</a> in an event that will be streamed live on Max in March.</p>



<p>But fans suspect the fight will not be a boxing a match, and that the brothers are promoting some other sort of competition.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, Jake&#8217;s meteoric rise from YouTuber to prizefighter has led fans to wonder just how wealthy he&#8217;s become over the course of his career.</p>

<p>So join us as we dive into Jake&#8217;s finances and attempt to answer the all-important question: Is he finally richer than his brother?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jake-paul-s-net-worth-is-surprising-on-multiple-levels">Jake Paul&#8217;s Net Worth Is Surprising on Multiple Levels</h2>



<p>You might think it&#8217;s a no-brainer that Jake is the wealthier Paul brother.</p>



<p>After all, due to his boxing career, he&#8217;s much more high-profile than Logan at the moment.</p>



<p>And in addition to the money he makes in the ring and off social media, Jake is the founder of sports management company Most Valuable Promotions and the co-founder of venture capital firm the Anti-Fund.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1595543752-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jake Paul poses for a photo after defeating Nate Diaz at the American Airlines Center on August 05, 2023 in Dallas, Texas.

<p>But despite Jake&#8217;s many revenue streams, big brother Logan is still significantly richer.</p>



<p>Yes, according to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-comedians/jake-paul-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Jake is worth about $100 million in the wake of the Tyson fight.</p>



<p>Logan, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/logan-paul-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth an astonishing $150 million</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-very-wealthy-sibling-rivalry">A Very Wealthy Sibling Rivalry</h2>

<p>Like Jake, Logan started out as a YouTuber and has since branched out into several different markets.</p>



<p>In addition to creating wildly popular content, he&#8217;s also the co-founder of beverage company Prime and snack brand Lunchly.</p>



<p>So yeah, both Pauls are doing quite well for themselves. But Logan&#8217;s personal wealth is still far greater than his brother&#8217;s.</p>

<p>How much longer will that be the case?</p>



<p>Well, Jake and Paul both benefit from one another&#8217;s success, and we&#8217;re sure they both take pride in how wealthy their family has become. </p>



<p>But the brothers are both fierce competitors, as well. And as much wish each other well, we&#8217;re guessing both would like to score the title of their mother&#8217;s richest son.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s an honor that Jake is willing to fight for.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re old enough to remember the early 2000s, then you know that Nelly was a regular hitmaking machine.</p>



<p>The St. Louis-based rapper burst onto the scene in 2000 with his debut album <em>Country Grammar</em>.</p>



<p>In the years that followed, Nelly would rack up a slew of hits, including platinum chart-topper like &#8220;Hot In Herre&#8221; and &#8220;Dilemma,&#8221; on which he collaborated with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/kelly-rowland/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Rowland</a>.</p>

<p>These days, Nelly is a living legend in the world of hip hop.</p>



<p>And he&#8217;s got the bank account to prove it!</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a longtime fan or a newcomer to Nellyville, you might find yourself wondering how much cash the emcee earned from all those hit records. Well, we&#8217;ve got the answers you&#8217;re looking for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nelly-s-net-worth">Nelly&#8217;s Net Worth</h2>



<p>The website Celebrity Net Worth estimates that <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-rappers/nelly-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nelly is worth about $70 million</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="807" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183300636-807x1024.jpg" alt="US singer-songwriter Ashanti and husband US rapper Nelly attend the Baby2Baby gala at Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, California, November 9, 2024.

<p>Needless to say, that&#8217;s not too shabby. And the same site puts <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/singers/ashanti-net-worth/\" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashanti&#8217;s net worth</a> at roughly $5 million.</p>



<p>That seems like a low estimate, but whatever the case, this is one wealthy power couple!</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/ashanti-pregnant-engaged-nelly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nelly and Ashanti welcomed a child together</a> last year. It&#8217;s his fifth kid and her first.</p>



<p>In 2016, it was reported that there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly#Tax_lien_(2016)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 million lien against Nelly</a> for unpaid taxes, but it seems that that matter has now been resolved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-does-nelly-s-wealth-come-from">Where Does Nelly&#8217;s Wealth Come From?</h2>



<p>As we mentioned earlier, Nelly notched one hot after another, starting in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Beginning with his debut 2000 <em>Country Grammar</em>, Nelly released eight studio albums, all of which made appearances on Billboard&#8217;s Hot 100.</p>



<p>Singles like &#8220;Country Grammar (Hot Sh-t)&#8221; and &#8220;Ride Wit Me&#8221; created the kind of genre-transcending crossover success that we rarely see nowadays.</p>



<p>At 50, Nelly isn&#8217;t churning out the hits quite like he used to, but he remains highly relevant thanks to his huge catalog of hits and the fact that he&#8217;s still in the game.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1344336605-1024x683.jpg" alt="Nelly attends the 2021 BET Hip Hop Awards at Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center on October 01, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.

<p>His 2021 album <em>Heartland</em> may not have gone triple platinum like Country Grammar, but it featured cameos from popular acts like Darius Rucker and Florida Georgia Line, and it received strong reviews from critics.</p>



<p>Nelly has reached the point in his career where he doesn&#8217;t have to rap, but clearly, he still enjoys making music.</p>



<p>He might be fabulously wealthy, but don&#8217;t be surprised if Nelly swings through your city on a nostalgia tour sometime in the near future!</p>

<p>Besides plenty of hit songs, Drake has established himself as one of the wealthiest rappers in the game. Despite some feuds, Drake&#8217;s net worth is certainly not something to diss. </p>



<p>While most people think of Drake (whose real name is Aubrey Graham) for his countless hits, the rapper has been in the public eye for most of his life. </p>



<p>Drake began his career as an actor, and he&#8217;s still remembered by many <em>Degrassi </em>fans for his portrayal of Jimmy on the teen drama. In the late aughts, the actor made the transition to music, and he&#8217;s become a global superstar.</p>



<p>Since pivoting to music, many of his records have been regarded as classics, like <em>Thank Me Later </em>and <em>If You&#8217;re Reading This, It&#8217;s Too Late</em>. Throughout his career, Drake has broken and set streaming and <em>Billboard </em>records.</p>

<p>Despite having plenty of fans ready to listen to whatever he does, Drake has had his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/drake-shooting-near-rappers-toronto-home-leaves-one-man-seriously-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share of public feuds</a> over the years. He&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/travis-scott-and-drake-sued-for-750-dollars-million-in-wake-of-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly sparred</a> with the likes of Meek Mill, Pusha T, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kanye-west-kris-jenner-had-sex-with-drake-and-i-can-prove-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West,</a> dropping diss tracks over the years.</p>

<p>Drake is worth an estimated $250 million, according to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-rappers/drake-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Celebrity Net Worth</em>.</a> While most of Drake&#8217;s income comes from his music, he also has an estimated $400 million worldwide partnership with UMG. </p>



<p>Besides music, Drake has established himself as an actor, and he has returned to the world of television. He&#8217;s an executive producer on the hit HBO series <em>Euphoria</em> &#8212; which was the title of one of Kendrick&#8217;s diss tracks &#8212; as well as the British crime drama <em>Top Boy</em>.</p>

His net worth was estimated to be at $150 million in June 2019, according <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/06/14/drake-net-worth-150-million-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a></em>.

<p>Drake is definitely doing well for himself, but there are rappers that are still richer than him. A 2024 report listed Drake as the ninth richest rapper in the world, according to <em><a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/10-richest-rappers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High Snobiety.</a></em></p>



<p>The report ranked Drake higher than Snoop Dogg (only time you&#8217;ll hear that), Lil Wayne, and a few others. The top slots on the list were taken by Jay-Z, Diddy, and Dr. Dre. Drake&#8217;s other rival Kanye West ranked at four.</p>

<p>When making comparisons to other rappers, Drake is mostly now tied to Kendrick Lamar due to their intense rap battle against one another during the 2024 summer.</p>

<p>Kendrick took a shot on his verse in &#8220;Like That,&#8221; which led to an intense free-for-all between the two. Still, Drake got his share of barbs in with &#8220;Family Matters&#8221; and &#8220;Taylor Made Freestyle.&#8221; </p>



<p>While Drake and Kendrick&#8217;s feud has deep roots, many people sided with K.dot after his disses &#8220;Euphoria&#8221; and &#8220;Not Like Us&#8221; dropped. The latter racked up tons of airplay and streams.</p>



<p>Drake even filed a petition against Universal Music Group (his own label), alleging that they had artificially inflated streaming numbers for Kendrick&#8217;s diss track. Unfortunately, this move didn&#8217;t sway public respect. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/15/drake-files-federal-lawsuit-against-umg-over-kendrick-lamar-not-like-us-feud/">Drake has now filed a federal lawsuit against UMG</a>, alleging that the company pushed a &#8220;false and malicious narrative&#8221; through Kendrick&#8217;s diss tracks.</p>

<p>While the feud has mostly been dormant, Drake did most recently appear to address the hit to his public image on his track &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stl-R9m9T9Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fighting Irish Freestyle,</a>&#8221; which he quickly deleted from the producer&#8217;s YouTube page.</p>



<p>While Kendrick has been declared the winner in his feud with Drake, he&#8217;s actually not as wealthy as his foe. K.dot may have the Grammys and public acclaim, but Drizzy has the dollars.</p>



<p>Kendrick&#8217;s net worth falls over $100 million short of Drake&#8217;s. His net worth is an estimated $140 million, according to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/richest-rappers/kendrick-lamar-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Celebrity Net Worth</em>. </a></p>
