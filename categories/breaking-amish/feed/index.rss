<p>Very sad news this week out of the reality television universe:</p>



<p>Mary Schmucker, the matriarch on the popular TLC series Breaking Amish, passed away at her home in Pennsylvania on Friday, March 28.</p>



<p>She was 65 years old.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s son, Andrew, spoke to TMZ and confirmed the death of his mother, telling the celebrity gossip website that Mary had briefly been hospitalized for a few days before finally losing her battle with colon cancer.</p>



<p>Andrew also told this outlet that the rest of the family has been notified of Mama Mary&#8217;s death&#8230; and added that he was on his way to Pennsylvania from his residence in Arkansas.</p>



<p>Mary was diagnosed with colon cancer back in 2022 and subsequently underwent surgery. </p>



<p>Two years later, this past November, her daughter-in-law announced that the star had placed in hospice care, meaning she was mostly focused on remaining comfortable for the remainder of her life.</p>

<p>Mary made her TLC debut on season 1 of Breaking Amish in 2012 before returning for the spinoff series Return to Amish in 2014. </p>



<p>The program followed a group of Amish individuals who left their traditional communities in order to experience life in the outside, non-Amish world. </p>



<p>Schmucker continued to be a central figure until she announced in a March 2022 Instagram Live that she would be leaving the show.</p>



<p>“I am not coming back on TV, but a lot of the others went back. I would love to come back on TV, but there’s too many issues that won’t work for me,” the Pennsylvania native said at the time.</p>



<p>“I would like to come back, but come back as we are doing now. I feel we should do a story like what happened after the show, where we are now and what happened to us, so people know, but they don’t want to do that.”</p>

<p>Just one month later, Mary revealed her cancer diagnosis. </p>



<p>“I just want to give a little update,” she wrote via her private Tupperware sales Facebook group in April 2022. “As you know I have colon cancer, and I am scheduled for surgery this month.”</p>

<p>Schmucker most remained out of the spotlight in the wake of this procedure, only returning to Facebook briefly in August 2024 to re-share a post about how schools should teach kids how to write in cursive. </p>



<p>She also re-posted a TikTok video from daughter-in-law Rebecca Schmucker asking for assistance raising funds for relatives who lost their one-year-old son after a battle with heart issues.</p>



<p>In November, daughter Rebecca wrote online:</p>



<p> &#8220;I’m making a prayer request for mom. She’s not feeling good the last few weeks and can’t keep anything down and she’s having trouble eating. She is on hospice now&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Her pain has been so bad and they are helping with that. If you could, flood her with positive messages and pray for her to be comfortable and pain free. Thank you!&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>We send our condolences to those who knew and loved Mary Schmucker. May she rest in peace.</strong></p>

<p>Very sad news this week out of the reality television world.</p>



<p>Mary Schmucker &#8212; a former TLC reality star often dubbed as &#8220;Mama&#8221; &#8212; has been moved to hospice care amid her ongoing cancer battle, according to the cable network personality&#8217;s daughter-in-law, Rebecca Schmucker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’m making a prayer request for mom,&#8221; Rebecca wrote as a caption at the time. </p>

<script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>



<p>Schmucker appeared on both Breaking Amish and Return to Amish, alongside son Abe and daughter-in-law Rebecca. </p>



<p>She was initially a recurring cast member, although she remained on the show following Abe and Rebecca’s departure because she became a rather big fan-favorite.</p>



<p>Hence the number of sorrowful comments left this week on Rebecca&#8217;s Instagram picture and affiliated statement.</p>



<p>“Stay strong! Holding you in the light and wishing you a swift recovery,” wrote one follower, while another added:</p>



<p>“Stay strong. the world is praying for you. We Love you.”</p>

<p>On March 10, 2022, Mary confirmed that she was leaving Breaking Amish after several seasons.</p>



<p>“I am not coming back on TV, but a lot of the others went back. I would love to come back on TV, but there’s too many issues that won’t work for me,” the Pennsylvania native said back then. </p>



<p>“I would like to come back, but come back as we are doing now. I feel we should do a story like what happened after the show, where we are now and what happened to us, so people know, but they don’t want to do that.”</p>



<p>A month later, Mary announced she was scheduled for colon cancer surgery.</p>



<p>While the procedure seemingly went smoothly, Mary’s condition later took a turn for the worse, as Schmucker noted in the summer of 2022. </p>



<p>“When I did my surgery, they said they got all of the cancer. Two weeks later they called me and said, ‘You have to come in right away.’” Mary wrote on Facebook about two and a half years ago. </p>



<p>“Now they tell me, I have stage three cancer, almost stage four. Chemo will not help on stage four. So, why should I even do chemo? But I’m not taking their word for it; I’m going for a second opinion.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say for certain what that second opinion came back with, but we&#8217;ll be keeping Mary Schmucker and her loved ones in our prayers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Some troubling news today out of the world of reality television:</p>
<p>Jeremiah Raber has been accused of assaulting and threatening his wife, Carmela Raber, who filed for a restraining order against her spouse on March 10.</p>
<p>According to court documents obtained by In Touch Weekly, the Return to Amish star asked for this order of protection due to an alleged altercation between herself and Jeremiah.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Jeremiah told me he was going to &lsquo;put me 6 feet under,&quot; Caremla wrote in these legal documents, adding in disturbing fashion:</p>
<p>&quot;He gets nose to nose, yelling in my face, pushes my chest and I fell backwards, repeatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Jeremiah tells me, &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t stop with my bulls&mdash;t, he will knock me out.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>From there,&nbsp;Raber claims that her&nbsp;estranged husband &ldquo;threatens to do Facebook Lives to expose my address&rdquo; so that strangers can find her and &ldquo;[her] kid.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In addition to her recent claims of abuse, Carmela also listed a numbe rof other instances of alleged abuse&#8230; dating back to 2017.</p>
<p>These include accusations of smothering, assault and him throwing hot coffee at her.</p>
<p>Speaking to In Touch about these allegations, <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/return-to-amish-jeremiah-allegedly-pushed-threatened-carmela/">Jeremiah didn&#8217;t really issue</a> a denial, instead saying most of it stemmed from four-plus years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s all in the reports from back then,&quot; he told this tabloid.</p>
<p>&quot;She used the s&mdash;t to get the order just to kick me out. It&rsquo;s sad how quick people are to post stuff like that but turn a blind eye to the change for the better people have made in their life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>A week after Carmela filed for this restraining order, Jeremiah told Facebook fans that the couple had broken up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, Carmela and I split up,&rdquo; Jeremiah said in a video posted on March 17.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to the people that wanted us to stay together. I wanted it to work. She didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not gonna fight any more.</p>
<p>&quot;She never fought for it so why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Raber filmed this video from his car because, he claimed at the time, his wife had thrown him out.</p>
<p>As for the restraining order?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything anyways because I&rsquo;m outta here,&rdquo; he said, adding a few days later:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have the money for a hotel, but why spend it if I can just stay in the car for free, and save the money and use that money to get to Ohio?</p>
<p>&quot;So, once I get enough money saved up, then I am leaving this state and never looking back.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>For her part, meanwhile, Carmela has said next to nothing about the alleged assault by Jeremiah, but she&#8217;s been sharing a numberr of graphics on social media.</p>
<p>One of them, from a Faceboook post in January, seems rather telling at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the prettiest woman could feel insecure if she loves the wrong man,&quot; it reads.</p>
<p>&quot;What makes her beautiful is a man who can treat her right.&quot;</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/">watch Breaking Amish online</a>, however, you know this is more complicated than traditional first-time parenthood for so many reasons with Matt.</p>
<p>Not only did he Break Amish, but his conduct in Brooklyn has been questionable from the start, and the birth of his child also puts him at a life crossroads.</p>
<p>What decision will he make with regard to his music career?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Speaking of complex relationships and tough decisions, Bates confronted Rena about the newest challenging wrinkle to impact the couple&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>Barbie also to make a choice that would change her life forever, with the stakes higher than we can possibly imagine and the finality of it all looming large.</p>

<p>As expected, this attitude was met with mixed results when it came time to take action on the TLC reality hit. Especially for Matt and his lifelong dream.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/season-3/seizing-the-moment/"></a></figure><figcaption>Watch Breaking Amish Season 3 Episode 9 Online</figcaption>
<p>With his very first live musical performance, dude thought he was on top of the world, but then his mood plummeted, and not for reasons you&#8217;d expect.</p>
<p>Hearing shocking news from Venus was jarring for him and altered his perspective on a lot of things, as you will see when you <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/">watch Breaking Amish online</a>.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t give much more away here, but as you know, Matt has already been through the wringer this season (albeit largely thanks to his own actions).</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>How he holds up going forward is very much an unanswered question.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as for Vonda, she finally began to move on from her late boyfriend this week, something that has hung over her head as long as we&#8217;ve known her.</p>
<p>Bates, for his part, grapples with a potentially major life decision.</p>
<p>What did that entail and what did he decide? The answer is just a click away, <em>Breaking Amish </em>fans. Prepare to sit back and make yourselves uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Seriously. We love the show but it can get a little awkward.</p>

<p>The focal point of <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/episodes/season-3/what-tomorrow-may-bring/">Breaking Amish Season 3 Episode 8</a> was the return of Miriam to New York, which we can tell you without much surprise was not smooth.</p>
<p>In fact, the reunion was about as short-lived as reunions come.</p>
<p>Bates, meanwhile, was laser-focused on his acting career, which has long been his professional dream, and one he feels may be within reach now in N.Y.</p>
<p>To say his mother does not approve of this decision is an understatement, however, and it casts a pall over his pursuits, whether he admits it or not.</p>
<p>This really cuts like a knife to the essence of <em>Breaking Amish</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to make an omelette, as they say, you&#8217;re going to have to break some eggs. If you want to Break Amish roots, that&#8217;s going to be messy as well.</p>
<p>These familial conflicts are to be expected, but that doesn&#8217;t make them any easier to go through for the youngans looking to forge their own path in life.</p>

<p>What went on in this latest installment of the TLC hit series.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Matt and Bates both went home to Amish country in a bid to salvage relationships with the women they love, and feel they have wronged.</p>
<p>Matt, in particular, has a tough road ahead of him there.</p>
<p>Needless to say, making things right meant righting wrongs that weren&#8217;t easily righted, or at least reconciling situations and issues not easily reconciled.</p>
<p>For Bates, were his efforts a case of too little too late?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>He started to realize that it might very well be, and then compounding the issue was the startling revelation that his real family could be very close by.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Right under his nose in New York City.</p>
<p>Follow the link to <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/">watch Breaking Amish online</a> and see how the two guys fared in their bids for redemption, and what the ladies were up to Thursday as well &#8230;</p>

<p>So what made it particularly true of this week&#8217;s?</p>

<p>If you dressed like an Amish person, particularly one who moved to New York, the city that never sleeps and is at the forefront of every trend, you&#8217;d get it.</p>
<p>If not, you can&#8217;t wrap your head around just how Matt, Miriam, Bates and company must feel, having been transplanted into a life so new and foreign.</p>
<p>Ostracized, outcast and alone?</p>
<p>That may not even cover it.</p>
<p>Looking for some new ways of covering their bodies, though, was the name of the game as the five cast members decided they needed new wardrobes.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>For life in The Big Apple, this is practically essential as they try to assimilate, or at least see if they can see a life there that spans more than a month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a contemplative Miriam focused on her future, which is up in the air as much now as ever before, and leaves her at a crossroads in life.</p>
<p>At the same time, the tumult that is Matt&#8217;s marriage took another stunning turn (of his own making?), and Bates received a surprise from his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Where did we leave all three of them and their cohorts at the end of the night? Follow the link to <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/">watch&nbsp;Breaking Amish online</a> and see for yourself!</p>

<p>In Breaking Amish Season 3 Episode 5, Matt&#8217;s wife learned the truth from Miriam about their fling, which threatens to rock their family to its core.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vonda attempted online dating and Bates pursued his acting career.</p>
<p>All the while, their hard-partying, act-first-think-later antics threaten to get in the way of their aspirations and efforts to become productive society members.</p>
<p>No, this is not an episode of <a href="/categories/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/"><em>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</em></a>.</p>
<p>You would think you were <em>Keeping Up </em>with them, or at least with some of that show&#8217;s writers, when you saw one of the Amish, Bates, on an interview.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>He has major issues trying out to be a tour guide, thanks to a major hangover, which he is very open about (for better or worse) during the interview process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a lot more about it when I&#8217;m not hungover,&rdquo; Bates admits as he fields important questions such as why New York is even called New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can talk about farming and milking goats, but talking about worldly stuff in New York City, that&#8217;s gonna be tough,&rdquo; he laments, as if he&#8217;s surprised.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an interesting week, and that&#8217;s not even getting into the drama with Matt, which we can&#8217;t do justice to here and you have to see to believe.</p>

<p>Most notably, Matt and his marriage were back under the microscope &#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/season-3/house-divided/"></a></figure><figcaption>Watch Breaking Amish Season 3 Episode 4 Online</figcaption>
<p>Picking up where things left off last week, <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/episodes/season-3/house-divided/">Breaking Amish Season 3 Episode 4</a> highlighted the rift within the group, stemming from Matt&#8217;s shady unfaithfulness.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of his hookup, Matt told his wife about Miriam.</p>
<p>That did not go over well, as he&#8217;d fulfilled her worst nightmare.</p>
<p>In his mind, though, his wife maybe shouldn&rsquo;t be quite so judgmental as she once cheated on him too &#8230; but that sort of misses the point. By a mile.</p>
<p>They stayed together through that, and are expecting a baby now. He lied and strayed for kind of no reason. How does her affair really apply anymore?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>While he only seems half apologetic, he did his best to make amends with the group, and specifically Miriam, to make sure they could go on together.</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/breaking-amish/full-episodes/">watch Breaking Amish online</a>, though, you know that&#8217;s wishful thinking, as drama seems to follow them wherever they go and whatever they do.</p>
<p>Vonda, for her part, had been doing better until receiving a text from back home that led to her calling up the bishop and giving her a piece of their mind.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s Breaking Amish and then there&#8217;s this. Intense.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t just stand up to a bishop, let alone like that.</p>
<p>While that was an intense moment, it was far from the last, as Matt came clean about how he was adopted by the Amish community and never felt like he belonged.</p>
<p>This guy has a lot of emotional baggage, clearly.</p>
<p>At a Bulgarian restaurant, things worsened for him as he learned that while he is of Bulgarian descent, most people who are have whiter skin than he.</p>
<p>The Gypsies on the other hand, have darker complexion, and are regarded as the lesser in their culture. All of this was a bit of a culture shock, honestly.</p>
<p>What turned things around was meeting and bonding with a gypsy Bulgarian, from whom Matt learned they have not lost touch with their past, or traditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miriam and Bates got into a fight at a club they all went to, and later, she told the gang that she may want return home sooner than later.</p>
<p>She misses her son and isn&#8217;t having a great time in NYC and being around Matt is just weird &#8230; and about to get weirder as his wife shows up for a surprise visit!</p>
<p>In all his apologizing and soul-baring earlier, Matt apparently failed to mention to the rest of the <em>Breaking Amish</em> crew that his spouse is also pregnant.</p>
<p>Matt? Meet doghouse, yet again.</p>
