<p>Several months ago, we learned something salacious about Foo Fighters member Dave Grohl:</p>



<p>He had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/">fathered a child out of wedlock</a>.</p>



<p>“I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage,” the musician wrote on Instagram, admitting to the infidelity and paternity and adding:</p>



<p>“I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="746" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1024x746.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522173" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-768x559.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-2048x1492.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-960x699.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1080x787.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2160171163-1200x874.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl of rock band Foo Fighters performs on the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival on July 5, 2024 in Roskilde, Denmark. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (HELLE ARENSBAK/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The question since this time, of course, has been: Did Grohl successfully regain his wife&#8217;s trust?</p>



<p>Or is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohl-divorce/">Jordyn Blum still thinking about filing for divorce</a>?</p>



<p>“Jordyn has forgiven Dave and is trying to move on,” a source says in latest issue of Us Weekl. &#8220;She is [still] completely devastated by the situation but is standing by his side.”</p>



<p>For now, at least, it seems.</p>

<p>As cited above, Grohl and Blum marriage made headlines last year after the star revealed his affair and subsequent love child. </p>



<p>Grohl and Blum themselves are the parents of daughters Violet, 18, Harper, 15, and Ophelia, 10.</p>



<p>According to this tabloid insider, Grohl and Blum have put in the work to keep their family together. Again, <em>for now</em>.</p>



<p>“They are going to counseling, and Dave has been doing anything he can to win back Jordyn’s trust,” the source says of the couple. “Neither of them wants the family broken.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="852" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1024x852.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl and wife Jordyn Blum attend Paul McCartney's &amp; Nancy Shevell's party at The Bowery Hotel on October 21, 2011 in New York City." class="wp-image-519882" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1024x852.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-300x250.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-768x639.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-2048x1705.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-960x799.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1080x899.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-129906485-1200x999.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl and wife Jordyn Blum attend Paul McCartney&#8217;s &amp; Nancy Shevell&#8217;s party at The Bowery Hotel on October 21, 2011 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For the record, the name of Grohl&#8217;s mistress has been revealed; it is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jennifer-young-comes-forward-as-mother-of-dave-grohls-child/">Jennifer Young</a>.</p>



<p>From what we can gather, the singer is not involved with raising her baby.</p>



<p>After news of the cheating scandal broke, Blum was spotted without her wedding ring, fueling chatter that she and Grohl were headed for a break-up. </p>



<p>The Foo Fighters subsequently canceled their performance at the Soundside Music Festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which was scheduled for September 2024.</p>



<p>The spouses <em>did</em> spend the holidays late last year with each other in California, however.</p>



<p>Blum, meanwhile, has not addressed any part of this controversy in public.</p>

<p>Back in September of 2024, Foo Fighters fans were disappointed by the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Grohl had fathered a child</a> with a mystery woman.</p>



<p>The birth of a child is always a joyous occasion, and this was no exception. But Dave is married, and he and his wife have three kids, the eldest of whom is 18.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the rest of the Grohl clan probably wasn&#8217;t thrilled by the news that the Nirvana drummer had been banging groupies.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the identity of Dave&#8217;s baby mama</a> has been revealed, and she&#8217;s telling her side of the story for the first time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-dave-grohl-s-baby-mama">Who is Dave Grohl&#8217;s baby mama?</h2>



<p>Not surprisingly, 38-year-old Jennifer Young is a big fan of rock music. And we&#8217;re assuming Nirvana and the Foo Fighters are high on her list of favorite bands.</p>



<p>In a new report from the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/us-news/jennifer-young-confirms-shes-the-mother-of-dave-grohls-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a></em>, Young is identified as the mother of Dave&#8217;s youngest daughter.</p>



<p>The Florida native is currently living the single mom life in Los Angeles.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1202198673-1024x683.jpg" alt='Dave Grohl stops by  "The Nowhere Inn" Premiere Party at WarnerMedia Lodge: Elevating Storytelling with AT&amp;T presented by Topic Studios during Sundance Film Festival 2020 on January 26, 2020 in Park City, Utah.

<p>According to the Post, Jennifer resides in a &#8220;leafy&#8221; LA suburb where her mother and daughter. It&#8217;s unclear if she relocated so that her child could be closer to Grohl.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-she-getting-the-best-of-grohl">Is she getting the best of Grohl?</h2>



<p>Naturally, the outlet asked Young if Dave is involved in the kid&#8217;s life, but she demurred, saying, “I can’t comment.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why she chose this time to come forward. Perhaps she figured that the truth was certain to come out eventually (it&#8217;s not easy to keep high-profile secrets in 2025).</p>

<p>Young noted that she wished to keep the baby&#8217;s name a secret for fear of reprisal from the public.</p>



<p>“Protecting her identity is really important because there’s some really angry fans,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The <em>Post</em> reported that Young was in New York City on Valentine&#8217;s Day, the same weekend that Grohl was in town for the <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/aubrey-plaza-makes-snl-50-cameo-her-first-public-appearance-since-jeff-baenas-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SNL 50</a></em> celebration.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear if <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohl-mistress-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave is still married to Jordyn Blum</a> after coming clean about his love child last year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-had-another-confession-to-make">Dave had another confession to make </h2>

<p>Fans were openly heartbroken when the music legend &#8212; rock&#8217;s reigning &#8220;nice guy&#8221; &#8212; came clean about his infidelity.</p>



<p>“I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage,” Grohl wrote at the time. </p>



<p>“I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her. I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.</p>



<p>“We’re grateful for your consideration toward all the children involved, as we move forward together.”</p>



<p>Again, it&#8217;s not clear if Dave is actively involved in his youngest child&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>But the <em>Post</em> reports that Jennifer has tattoos honoring both Metallica and the Beatles, so at least the kid is being raised in a rock-friendly household!</p>

<p>Dave Grohl is a divorced man. The question is, will he be a divorced man twice over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a shocking Instagram post, the Foo Fighters rocker admitted to the world that he had cheated on his wife of over 20 years. To make matters worse, the affair resulted in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love child</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This story perhaps sounds familiar to those who have followed Dave’s career since his Nirvana days. For the rest of us, it’s worth explaining that Dave Grohl knows exactly what happens when you cheat on a spouse: divorce.</p>



<p>How much of his <a data-wpil-monitor-id="420" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/terrence-howard-divorced-marriage-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marital history</a> is about to repeat itself? And how much MONEY is it going to cost him if he gets divorced?! Let’s dive in. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="685" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440-685x1024.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl's divorce and new wife" class="wp-image-508989" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440-685x1024.jpg 685w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440-201x300.jpg 201w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440-768x1148.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440-642x960.jpg 642w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440-723x1080.jpg 723w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-512872440.jpg 803w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Musician Dave Grohl and his wife Jordyn Blum arrive on the red carpet for the 88th Oscars on February 28, 2016 in Hollywood, California.      <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo credit should read VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-s-divorce-his-first-marriage-ended-in-a-very-messy-way">Dave Grohl’s Divorce: His First Marriage Ended In A Very Messy Way</h2>



<p>Picture it: 1994. That’s the year Dave Grohl married his first wife, Jennifer Youngblood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her last name kind of says it all. At the time, Dave was only 25 years old. He was still with Nirvana and his friend, Kurt Cobain, had just died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In later years, Dave admitted in interviews that he was far too <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/10/jinger-duggar-reveals-how-michelle-bribes-the-kids-to-marry-youn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="418">young to get married</a>. That’s probably why they split in 1997.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s far from the end of the story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are conflicting reports as to why the two split, with one prevailing theory being that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/14/popandrock.foofighters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he cheated</a> on her. For his part, Dave insisted that the split was amicable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&#8220;I was 25, my wife was even younger. We weren&#8217;t ready to get married,&#8221; he once told <a href="https://www.nme.com/photos/the-wisdom-of-dave-grohl-1417857">NME</a>. &#8220;I miss her a ton, she&#8217;s the funniest goddamn weirdo you ever met in your life. Absolutely adorable. It would have been better had we not got married. But you live and you learn.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="654" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521-1024x654.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-508977" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521-1024x654.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521-768x490.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521-960x613.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521-1080x689.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160171521.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl of rock band Foo Fighters performs on the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival on July 5, 2024 in Roskilde, Denmark. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Helle Arensbak / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OU)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-first-divorce-actually-broke-up-the-band">His First Divorce Actually Broke Up The Band </h2>



<p>Turns out, Dave Grohl’s divorce had bigger ramifications than just paperwork and division of assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also fractured the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/foo-fighters-cancel-all-tour-dates-in-wake-of-taylor-hawkins-dea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="419">Foo Fighters</a> and led to one member leaving the group forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The story goes that guitarist Pat Smear was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/prince-harry-is-heartbroken-over-family-split-close-friend-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="417">close friends</a> with Jenner Youngblood, Dave’s first wife. The split apparently was the breaking point for Pat, who already was feeling touring fatigue and was at odds with Dave on how he was controlling the group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was just so sick of it. I was just so sick of the whole thing,” Smear recalled in the documentary <em>Foo Fighters: Back and Forth</em>. </p>



<p>He added: “I [didn’t] want to go out on another bazillion show tour and I don’t care. I just [didn’t] want to do this anymore.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, not only did Dave have to deal with a broken marriage, but he had to fix a broken band as well.&nbsp;He managed to mend fences with Pat, who toured with the band in 2006. </p>



<p>But some lessons are hard to learn than others. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="667" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449-1024x667.jpg" alt=" Dave Grohl, and his wife Jordyn Grohl " class="wp-image-508990" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449-1024x667.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449-300x196.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449-768x500.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449-960x626.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449-1080x704.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160245449.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Dave Grohl, and his wife Jordyn Grohl are seen in the Royal Box ahead of the Ladies&#8217; Singles first round match between Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain and VONduring day two of The Championships Wimbledon 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-gohl-faces-divorce-again-with-second-wife-nbsp">Dave Gohl Faces Divorce Again With Second Wife&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Six years later, Dave married his second wife Jordyn Blum at their Los Angeles home on August 2, 2003.</p>



<p>For over 20 years, the pair seemed to be in marital bliss. They welcomed three children, all girls, and Dave appeared to a doting dad even when he was out on tour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I used to tour nine months out of the year. Now I don’t like being away from my kids for more than 12 days,” he <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1945348-1,00.html">told Time</a> in 2009.</p>



<p>Then, on Sep 10, 2024, he announced he was the father of a fourth little girl &#8211; but with another woman not his wife! Yes, Dave admitted to an affair in a short, but shocking statement on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage,” he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_v4WBbyxnd/">wrote on Instagram</a> Tuesday.</p>



<p>“I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.”</p>



<p>Now the question is, will his second marriage end in divorce like his first? It sounds like Dave is preparing for it. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-lawyers-up-for-second-divorce">Dave Grohl Lawyers Up For Second Divorce</h2>



<p>Dave Grohl&nbsp;reportedly retained a divorce attorney before announcing his love child. Clearly, ending his marriage&nbsp;of 21 years is on the table, according a source who spoke to <em><a href="https://people.com/dave-grohl-retained-divorce-lawyer-before-revealing-he-welcomed-baby-outside-marriage-source-exclusive-8710296?hid=1d3875d01f2e5887390aff28f958bfa5227efa3a&amp;did=14523820-20240911&amp;utm_source=ppl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ppl-news_newsletter&amp;utm_content=091124&amp;lctg=1d3875d01f2e5887390aff28f958bfa5227efa3a&amp;lr_input=49bbb90ef70860c6d66c2236fcc42d2553a87206d049dc89dd6f450cda855393&amp;utm_term=midday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE</a></em>.</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s no word yet on Jordyn and if she&#8217;s doing the same. It might be that Dave prepared for the worst from his wife &#8211; a demand for a divorce &#8211; before actually telling her the horrible truth.  And for good reason.</p>



<p>“Dave knew his infidelity could end in divorce,” says an insider who spoke to InTouch. “And if that happens, Jordyn will be one very <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/dave-grohls-wife-will-be-very-rich-if-divorce-happens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rich woman</a>.”</p>



<p>It remains unclear whether the couple signed a prenup agreement before tying the knot in 2003. However, the Nirvana drummer has reportedly amassed an estimated $330 million fortune, and if there isn&#8217;t a prenup written in his favor&#8230;</p>



<p>“Dave’s nervous,” admits the insider. “He wants to get ahead of the game because if Jordyn decides not to forgive him, she could easily end up walking away with half of everything.”</p>



<p>History does have a funny way of repeating itself, huh? </p>

<p>For several days now, Dave Grohl&#8217;s mistress&#8217; identity has been a hot topic of conversation on social media.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grohl has admitted to fathering a child </a>with a woman who is not his wife of more than 20 years, Jordyn Blum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-mistress-identity-what-do-we-know">Dave Grohl Mistress&#8217; Identity: What Do We Know?</h2>



<p>The identity of Grohl&#8217;s mistress remains a mystery. But gossip outlet <a href="https://www.deuxmoi.world/latest/dave-grohl-announces-birth-of-child-outside-of-marriage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeuxMoi</a> has offered new information courtesy of a tip from an anonymous informant.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dave is currently not living in the family home, but instead he is living in a home Jordyn recently renovated for her business,&#8221; the insider writes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t name the new baby&#8217;s mother, but she was well known to both Dave and Jordyn since 2017,&#8221; the source claims.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dave was not present for the birth but has been to see his new daughter multiple times. His other daughters have not yet met their sister.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>



<p>The insider goes on to claim that Grohl has been &#8220;struggling&#8221; since the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/taylor-hawkins-cause-of-death-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death of his friend and bandmate Taylor Hawkins</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>But, the insider says, &#8220;none of that can excuse what he has done to his family&#8221; and &#8220;divorce is definitely looking like an option.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-start-of-the-rumors">The Start of the Rumors</h2>



<p>DeuxMoi has long been considered one of the most credible gossip outlets. And they were the first to report on rumors that Grohl was cheating on his wife.</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dave-grohls-baby-mother-33641935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a></em>, the proprietor of the site alleged in a 2023 podcast interview that Grohl had been unfaithful.</p>



<p>The revelation prompted a series of Reddit threads about Grohl&#8217;s alleged infidelity. </p>



<p>&#8220;This frontman aka nice guy that was once in the most popular 90s band of all time isn&#8217;t the perfect guy you think he is. I&#8217;ve known him to have a muse/lover for years,&#8221; wrote one user.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been seen with him at multiple shows and events in different cities over the years. Can&#8217;t believe this has never got out bc they were so obvious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s cooled down now but def went on strong for a while. I wonder if his marriage is open? I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t the only girl,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>Grohl has been keeping a low profile this week for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>But we&#8217;ll continue to keep you updated on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>There goes my hero, Dave Grohl, confessing he had a secret baby “outside of his marriage.”</p>



<p>Wow!</p>



<p>For the second time this month, a celebrate figure in Hollywood has been rumored to have a side baby or love child; whatever the kids are calling it these days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, unlike <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/judge-mathis-divorce-side-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judge Mathis</a>, the Foo Fighters frontman is confessing to his affair in a lengthy message to his fans, his wife, and his family. </p>

<p>He’s giving all his apologies.</p>



<p>The Foo Fighters rocker announced that he welcomed a baby “outside of” his marriage to Jordyn Blum on September 10, much to the shock of his fans.</p>



<p>In a short but shocking statement, he shared that he is working to “regain” his wife’s “trust” after an affair led to his welcoming a new baby girl into his family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage,” he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_v4WBbyxnd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a> Tuesday.</p>



<p>“I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.”</p>



<p>Grohl ended his message by saying he and his family were “grateful for your consideration toward all the children involved” as they “move forward together.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-the-other-woman"><strong>Who Is The Other Woman?</strong></h2>



<p>The singer did not disclose any information about his newborn’s mother in his post. However, he vowed to show as much support for this new little girl as he does all of his other children.</p>



<p>“I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her,” he said in his announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dave is already a girl dad 3 times over. He shares three children with his wife Jordyn: Violet Maye, Harper Willow and Ophelia Saint, whom they welcomed in 2006, 2009 and 2014, respectively.</p>



<p>So far, none of his girls, or his wife, have made a statement about his affair or the new baby. </p>



<p>Dave has always been proud of his family, and has lamented in the past how he&#8217;s missed his kids while on tour. </p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0">“I used to tour nine months out of the year. Now I don’t like being away from my kids for more than 12 days,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1945348-1,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Time</a>&nbsp;in 2009.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0">“It’s changed everything that I do. When you have kids, you see life through different eyes. You feel love more deeply and are maybe a little more compassionate. It’s inevitable that that would make its way into your songwriting.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-s-marriage-is-it-over">Dave Grohl’s Marriage: Is It Over?</h2>



<p>Dave and his wife tied the knot in their Los Angeles home on August 2, 2003.</p>



<p>The guitarist and the former model initially met in 2001 at the Sunset Marquis Whiskey Bar.</p>



<p>As the news is so fresh, whether a divorce is on the table remains to be seen. </p>



<p>But history does have a way of repeating itself; He divorced his first wife, Jennifer Leigh Youngblood, in 1997, after admitting to infidelities. This marriage may go the same way as the first. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a9165/victorias-secret-sexiest-women-dupe2/">2007 interview with Elle</a>, Grohl shared that he stopped calling Blum after they went on a few first dates.</p>



<p>“When I first met my wife, we went out on a few dates and I decided that I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, so I just stopped calling,” he shared.</p>



<p>However, he had a change of heart as time passed by.</p>



<p>“After three months, I had a revelation and called her back. She picked up the phone and said, ‘Oh, I never thought I’d hear from you again,&#8217;” he recalled.</p>

<p>Do Dave Grohl and Taylor Swift have a beef? Well, now they do!</p>



<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/travis-kelce-performs-on-stage-with-taylor-swift-sends-universe-into-delirium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift&#8217;s <em>Eras </em>world tour performances</a> in London delighted fans. But even so, she has her critics.</p>



<p>Dave Grohl and his band, Foo Fighters, also performed in London for the first weekend of summer. Grohl made some comments that seemed to imply that he was accusing Taylor of not performing live.</p>



<p>What does Taylor have to say to that?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift performs in London for the Eras World Tour on June 21, 2024." class="wp-image-502577" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_taylorswift_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift performs on stage during the &#8220;Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour&#8221; at Wembley Stadium on June 21, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dave-grohl-cracked-a-joke-about-the-errors-tour">Dave Grohl cracked a joke about &#8216;The Errors Tour&#8217;</h2>



<p>While Taylor Swift was performing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/will-travis-kelce-be-at-taylor-swift-london-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium</a> on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Dave Grohl and his Foo Fighters band played London Stadium.</p>



<p>“So we like to call our tour the ‘Errors Tour,’” Grohl jokes on stage.</p>



<p>“We’ve had more than a few eras, and more than a few f&#8211;king errors as well,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Just a couple. That’s because we actually play live.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl in September of 2023." class="wp-image-502578" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl performs onstage during the launch of the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative at the U.S. Department of State on September 27, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Grohl is not a household name in the way that Taylor Swift is. However, many people do know of him. He&#8217;s one of the biggest faces in the realm of mainstream rock music.</p>



<p>He was also once a member of Nirvana.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s some random singer at open mic night getting people&#8217;s attention by (possibly) shading someone famous. This is an established, major name within the realm of music.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-dave-grohl-shading-taylor-swift">Was Dave Grohl shading Taylor Swift?</h2>



<p>“What?!” Grohl remarked to his audience. “Just saying. You guys like raw, live rock ‘n’ roll music, right? You came to the right f&#8211;king place.”</p>



<p>Earlier in the night, he had mentioned the Eras world tour to his audience &#8212; which apparently prompted boos.</p>



<p>To that, Dave Grohl simply responded: “I tell you, man, you don’t want to suffer the wrath of Taylor Swift.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="733" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-733x1024.jpg" alt="Dave Grohl in March of 2024." class="wp-image-502580" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-733x1024.jpg 733w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-215x300.jpg 215w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-768x1073.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-1466x2048.jpg 1466w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-687x960.jpg 687w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-773x1080.jpg 773w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-859x1200.jpg 859w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0624_davidgrohl_02-scaled.jpg 1833w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dave Grohl performs onstage during the Eighth Annual LOVE ROCKS NYC Benefit Concert For God&#8217;s Love We Deliver at Beacon Theatre on March 07, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for LOVE ROCKS NYC/God&#8217;s Love We Deliver)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Obviously, a lot of people on social media &#8212; particularly Swifties and Swift-haters alike &#8212; were quick to assume that Grohl was shading Swift.</p>



<p>At the same time, many have recalled <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-32871300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Grohl&#8217;s commentary</a> at BBC Radio 1&#8217;s Big Weekend in 2015, during which he told a crowd that he felt &#8220;obsessed&#8221; with Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>A lot can change in nine years. Did he go from dedicating a song to her to insulting her as an artist and a performer in order to appease a crowd of Swift-hating weirdos?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-taylor-swift-perform-live-her-response-to-dave-grohl-s-shade">Does Taylor Swift Perform Live? Her Response To Dave Grohl&#8217;s Shade</h2>



<p>On Sunday, June 23, Taylor Swift once again performed at Wembley Stadium. During that performance, Taylor paid tribute to her band.</p>



<p>“Every one of my band members, every single one of our crew, my band &#8212; who’s gonna be playing live for you for three and a half hours tonight &#8212; they deserve this so much,” she praised.</p>



<p>You can see multiple videos of Taylor saying just that <a href="https://x.com/swifferupdates/status/1804960268239429968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Twitter</a> and elsewhere on social media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/swifferupdates/status/1804960268239429968
</div></figure>



<p>It is entirely possible that Taylor&#8217;s remark was simply a tribute to her band, reminding everyone of their hard work.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/taylor-swift-eras-tour-its-coming-to-an-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Eras </em>world tour won&#8217;t last forever</a>. These professionals deserve recognition &#8212; and also to work in the future. This is their job, and no matter how well Taylor pays them, they&#8217;ll one day likely want to work again.</p>



<p>If Taylor Swift <em>did </em>say this to clap back at Dave Grohl&#8217;s, then she did it delicately, diplomatically, and masterfully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Dave Grohl is one of the most beloved figures in the world of modern rock for good reason:</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s commitment to his music is legendary, and during a show in Sweden last night,&nbsp;Grohl&nbsp;proved once again that <em>almost</em> nothing can keep him from entertaining his fans:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dave-grohl-falls-from-stage-breaks-leg"></a></figure>
<p>TMZ is reporting that Foo Fighters frontman&nbsp;fell from the stage and broke his leg while covering David Bowie and Queen&#8217;s 1981 classic &quot;Under Pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>As you can see in the clip above, Grohl&nbsp;kept on rocking, but had to concede defeat upon realizing how seriously injured he was.</p>
<p>&quot;You have my promise that the Foo Fighters are gonna come back and finish the show,&quot; Grohl&nbsp;told the crowd. &quot;But right now&#8230;I&#8217;m gonna go to the hospital. I&#8217;m gonna&nbsp;fix my leg. Then we&#8217;re gonna come back and play for you again!&quot;</p>
<p>Sources say Grohl got the medical attention he needed and is currently resting comfortably. No word on when he&#8217;ll be back on his feet and able to finish the Sweden gig, but we have no doubt he&#8217;ll make good on his promise.</p>
<p>Dave Grohl, man. Whether he&#8217;s reminding us not to<a href="/2014/11/dave-grohl-dont-smoke-weed-and-watch-keeping-up-with-the-kardash/"> smoke weed and watch the Kardashians</a> or finishing a song after<em> breaking his freaking leg</em>, this man is clearly committed to making the world a better place.</p>

<p>In general, Rose Tweeted on Monday that she&#8217;s sick of the Kardashians, describing them as &quot;plastic a** hoes bullying ppl cuz they got the media outlets on payroll.&quot;</p>
<p>This may come as a shock to readers (or it may come as the <em>opposite</em> of a shock to readers), but Rose isn&#8217;t the first celebrity to have a beef with Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and kompany.</p>
<p>Jon Hamm isn&#8217;t a fan. Dave Grohl has had a few choice words for the Kardashians.</p>
<p>Heck, the leader of the free world thinks Kim and her husband set a bad example for today&#8217;s youth.</p>
<p>Are you on Team Kardashian&nbsp;in any of these feuds? Do you remember how they each started?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Nirvana and Foo Fighters rocker Dave Grohl opens up in a new interview with The Sun (UK) about why he doesn&#8217;t smoke weed or do drugs anymore.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: It somehow involves Keeping Up With the Kardashians!</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped doing drugs when I was about 20 years old,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;But just recently I thought, &#8216;Oh I&#8217;m going to start smoking pot again to cure insomnia.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d put the kids to bed, go upstairs and smoke a little pot. But then I&#8217;d get stuck in front of the Kardashians on TV for 45 minutes. And it freaked me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m never doing this ever again.&#8217; It&#8217;s definitely not for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilarious bottom line: If you insist that you must <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/full-episodes/">watch Keeping Up With the Kardashians online</a>, fine. If you wish to smoke weed, that&#8217;s your decision.</p>
<p>Combine the two and prepare for downright scary results, though.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>It can hard enough to stomach, Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Scott, Kanye, Kris, Bruce, Brody, Brandon, <a href="/2014/08/45-inappropriate-kendall-and-kylie-jenner-photos-too-racy-for-te/">Kendall and Kylie Jenner</a> doing their thing while sober.</p>
<p>Can you imagine adding some controlled substances to the mix?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t. And thanks to Dave, we will know from his experience that any fleeting temptation to do so is surely misguided. Deeply, deeply misguided.</p>
<p>Remember as we head into Thanksgiving and the holiday season: Friends don&#8217;t let friends smoke marijuana and watch Keeping Up With the Kardashians.</p>
<p>And add Dave to the list of the Kards&#8217; famous, outspoken critics!</p>

<p>Instead of Brit, a prominent Vegas conglomerate allegedly went with a hypnotist, which the Foo Fighters frontman found particularly amusing:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/dave-grohl-on-britney-spears"></a></figure>
<p>Grohl, who&#8217;s filling in for Handler in the week leading up to Sunday&#8217;s Grammys, said of <a href="/stars/britney-spears.html">Britney</a>, &quot;She just kinda seems dead inside, like there&#8217;s nothing behind her eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like there&#8217;s nothing in her boobs anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>The ultimate insult.</p>
