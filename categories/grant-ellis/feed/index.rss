										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Grant Ellis is not here for your hate.</p>



<p>Late last month, the latest Bachelor lead made his selection, getting down on one knee to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/the-bachelor-recap-who-did-grant-ellis-send-home-in-week-1/">propose to Juliana Pasquarosa</a>.</p>



<p>From what we can gather so far, the relationship is actually going pretty well.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean fans are happy for the pair.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="393" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/MixCollage-12-Mar-2025-02-05-PM-1674-768x393-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522570" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/MixCollage-12-Mar-2025-02-05-PM-1674-768x393-1.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/MixCollage-12-Mar-2025-02-05-PM-1674-768x393-1-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis addresses the ABC camera here.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ellis seemingly made the mistake of referring to Juliana as &#8220;fun&#8221; on The Bachelor finale, which made many viewers think he isn&#8217;t serious about settling down.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s garnered a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/grant-ellis-responds-to-backlash-over-shocking-bachelor-pick-does-he-actually-wanna-get-married/">whole lot of backlash in response</a>.</p>



<p>And now Ellis has something to say about it.</p>



<p>“When Bach nation is everyone tryna get clout by taking shots and you just a Guy who’s happy he found love and happy his dad is sober,” Ellis wrote over a March 31TikTok video of him sitting in a car. </p>



<p>He added a purple heart emoji to the upload, too.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="620" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-1024x620.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-522581" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-1024x620.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-300x182.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-768x465.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-2048x1241.webp 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-960x582.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-1080x654.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/bachelor_grant_ellis-e1736272276396-1200x727.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Two stud muffins, folks. Grant Ellis and Jesse Palmer.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Stay classy bachelor nation,” Grant captioned the post, alongside <em>another</em> purple heart emoji. </p>



<p>For her part, Juliana wrote in the comments section, “We stay in our own lane bby. beyond proud of you AND your father.&#8221;</p>



<p>This footage came a day after Juliana told critics that she joined The Bachelor season 29 for, you guessed it, the right reasons.</p>



<p>Via TikTok, this season&#8217;s champion said:</p>



<p>“One thing about me is before filming The Bachelor, I created this life for myself that I absolutely love. And I didn’t go into this experience trying to create a new life after it. I came into this experience trying to find a man to bring into the life that I currently love. Just food for thought.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-1024x682.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-522192" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-1024x682.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-300x200.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-768x512.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-960x640.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-1080x720.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo-1200x800.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia-promo.webp 1919w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis and his Bachelor winner, Juliana Pasquarosa.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Pasquarosa continued as follows: </p>



<p>“Back in Newton, [Massachusetts], staying in Boston, not moving to L.A. I would love to take advantage of opportunities that present itself to me as long as it aligns with who I am and the type of life I want to live but otherwise, I’m really just a girl from Boston, Massachusetts.”</p>



<p>Juliana, who has clearly faced criticism herself, captioned the post: </p>



<p>“We all have different paths in life &amp; it’s all good whatever you chose for yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Ellis chose Juliana over runner-up, Litia Garr, the latter said she would have “a lot of questions” if she were Juliana … based on what Grant supposedly promised her.</p>



<p>On the After the Final Rose special, Litia said Ellis wanted to leave the series early a one point because he had fallen so hard for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you are the Bachelor, you do see your final two contestants as somebody that could be your wife,” Ellis explained Us Weekly last month. </p>



<p>“That’s where some confusion came into play. There’s room for interpretation when things are said, ‘off camera.’ At that point in time, I can’t really say much. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not gonna argue, I just have to accept whatever the conditions are and apologize and let her feel how she feels because she’s in a tough situation and she’s hurt. I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grant Ellis has made his decision.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s gotten down on one knee.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s chosen the woman with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life&#8230; or so the latest Bachelor would like everyone to believe.</p>

<p>On this week&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/the-bachelor-recap-who-did-grant-ellis-send-home-in-week-1/">finale of the long-running ABC franchise</a>, Ellis narrowed down his finalists to Juliana Pasquarosa and Litia Garr.</p>



<p>When speaking to his father about the pair of options, Ellis said the following:</p>



<p>“There’s love on both sides, but [it’s hard] deciding what to pick in such a short amount of time when I have a woman [Litia] who’s 31 who knows what she wants and would be there for me no matter what.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I have a woman [Juliana] who also loves me, but our relationship is more fun.”</p>



<p>In the end, Ellis went with Pasquarosa. Yes, the more <em>fun</em> one.</p>

<p>As you might expect, Grant&#8217;s phrasing has come back to bite him via social media.</p>



<p>“Sooo Litia can’t be a 30 year old that knows what’s [sic] she wants and be fun? Litia is too mature for Grant. #TheBachelor,” one critic wrote online in response, while another echoed this sentiment:</p>



<p>“You have ‘a woman who knows what she wants and one who’s [sic] relationship is more fun’ ??? grant you’re not serious .. you don’t want to get married #TheBachelor.”</p>



<p>A third chimed in:</p>



<p>“It’s so obvious that Grant chose Juliana because, despite coming on the bachelor, he’s not actually ready for marriage but wants a girlfriend.&#8221;</p>

<p>So&#8230; what&#8217;s the real deal? Is Grant Ellis really afraid of commitment? Is he just looking for a good time and not a life partner?</p>



<p>“I’m very serious. But everybody is different in a relationship,&#8221; <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bachelor-grant-addresses-criticism-for-picking-fun-juliana-over-litia/">Ellis has now told Us Weekly</a> of his intentions amid this controversy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some people are more serious and they don’t like to go out. Some people like to have fun. I think that in a relationship, you can be serious and have the best of both worlds — that’s what I meant.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our relationship is a friendship. It’s fun in the fact that we can let loose and be ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this same sit-down, Juliana said she would describe their romance as “easygoing,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t looking ahead to a legit future as aspiring spouses.</p>



<p>“Just because I said that doesn’t mean that I’m not serious. I’ve got tattoos, I like to have fun, but I take love very seriously,” Ellis added. “I poured my heart out there and that showed, and if people can’t see that, then they’re never gonna see it.”</p>



<p>Fair enough.</p>



<p>But we all know how this relationship is gonna end, don&#8217;t we?</p>

<p>It was a long and winding road, but in the end, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/the-bachelor-spoilers-grant-ellis-spills-on-happy-ending-regrets-from-season-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Ellis&#8217; found love on <em>The Bachelor</em></a>!</p>



<p>Now that the final rose has been handed out and the final tears have been shed, we can happily report that our <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/the-bachelor-spoilers-does-grant-ellis-propose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bachelor</em> spoilers</a> were accurate, and Grant wound up with Juliana Pasquarosa.</p>



<p>The former basketball phenom seemed to enjoy the search for his future wife. But he was also forced to acquaint himself with the messy side of the process as week after week, he thinned the herd and bid farewell to potential spouses.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="584" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-1024x584.png" alt="Grant Ellis has been named the Bachelor for the show's 29th season." class="wp-image-517930" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-1024x584.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-300x171.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-768x438.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-960x547.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-1080x615.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-28-at-8.16.12-AM-1200x684.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis has been named the Bachelor for the show&#8217;s 29th season.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the end, it was all worth it, of course, as Grant popped the question to the future Mrs. Ellis.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision, and it clearly pained Grant to part ways with Litia Garr, with whom he forged a connection very early in the process.</p>



<p>But in the end, Ellis relied on his heart, his gut, and advice from his parents (who were reunited for the first time in several years), and he made the decision to propose to Juliana in Punta Cana. The couple is currently engaged, with plans to tie the knot sometime in the near future.</p>



<p>“All I can say is casting did a really good job with these ladies — they’re one of a kind,” Ellis told <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-bachelor-season-29-winner-grant-ellis-juliana-pasquarosa-abc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wrap</a> in an interview. “It really was difficult for me at the end, just because I had two amazing women. And at the end of the day, I went with my heart.”</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look back at how we got to this point:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-did-grant-ellis-send-home-during-the-fantasy-suite-round">Who Did Grant Ellis Send Home During the Fantasy Suite Round?</h2>



<p>As longtime <em>Bachelor</em> fans know, the fantasy suite episode is as big as it gets (which is hopefully not a phrase that has to be to uttered in the fantasy suites).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s make-it-or-break-it time for Grant and his remaining ladies, and while all three dates went off without a hitch, in the end, Mr. Ellis was forced to narrow the field.</p>



<p>And sadly, that meant saying goodbye to fan favorite Zoe.</p>



<p>The model and tech engineer from NYC was obviously disappointed by Grant&#8217;s decision &#8212; but she might not have been completely shocked.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="664" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-664x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516205" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-664x1024.jpg 664w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-195x300.jpg 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-768x1184.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-623x960.jpg 623w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-701x1080.jpg 701w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90-778x1200.jpg 778w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Zoe-The-Bachelor-010625-0a73392e416945cead6d132f181d7a90.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zoe is a Tech Engineer/Model from New York City who canât and wonât live without tacos. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Disney/Matt Sayles)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After all, the lack of one-on-one time and the choice of a silent yoga date didn&#8217;t exactly bode well.</p>



<p>Still, it seemed like Grant struggled mightily with this decision &#8212; possibly the toughest choice he&#8217;s had to make so far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-got-sent-home-during-the-hometown-round">Who Got Sent Home During the Hometown Round?</h2>



<p>It was obviously a difficult rose ceremony for Grant.</p>



<p>He may not have had an easy time with the decision, but at least he was kind and gracious in showing Dina the exit.</p>



<p>The Chicago-based attorney with the fiery personality was an early frontrunner. But in the end, it just wasn&#8217;t meant to be.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516188" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Dina-The-Bachelor-010625-7b8067e20a1c47cda6bf8dd2f68be4a8.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dina is an Attorney from Chicago who has never met anyone who is cleaner and more organized than she is.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Disney/Matt Sayles)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And with that, Grant was down to his final three.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-got-sent-home-on-the-bachelor-week-5">Who Got Sent Home on &#8216;The Bachelor&#8217; Week 5?</h2>



<p>In a move that&#8217;s sure to please many fans (and quite a few cast members), Grant finally cut ties with this season&#8217;s villain, Carolina.</p>



<p>“It’s very disappointing…I feel blindsided,” said the emotional public relations expert as she left the show.</p>



<p>It was the end of a dramatic run for Carolina, and she may have been the only one who was surprised by her elimination.</p>

<p>Grant also cut ties with early front-runner Alexe, and Sarafiena, whom he had seemed to bond with in Spain.</p>



<p>And with that, it was down to the final four ahead of next week&#8217;s hometown round.</p>

<p>The group set off for Spain during Grant&#8217;s fourth week. But if the ladies thought they&#8217;d get to take a siesta from rose ceremonies, they were sorely mistaken!</p>



<p>First, in an ironic twist, fan favorite Rose decided to self-eliminate. And to be honest, Grane didn&#8217;t seem terribly upset about it. Call it a one-woman rose ceremony.</p>



<p>After that it was on to the real thing. And to the chagrin of Carolina haters everywhere, Grant <em>kept</em> the drama queen and cut ties with Natalie and Parisa instead.</p>

<p>Did Parisa talk about rocks too much? Maybe. We might never know what tipped the scales against the behavior analyst from Birmingham, Michigan.</p>



<p>But at least her cat will be happy to have her back.</p>

<p>Alas, Chloie, Bailey, and Alli Jo were all let go during Grant&#8217;s third rose ceremony.</p>



<p>Beverly Ortega was also forced to leave the show due to <a href="https://decider.com/2025/02/10/why-did-beverly-ortega-leave-the-bachelor-season-29-grant-ellis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an undisclosed medical issue</a>. “Apparently, Beverly got very sick after the basketball date and was taken to the hospital,&#8221; Reality Steve explains (via Decider). &#8220;She eventually wasn’t able to be medically cleared to return back to the show so she went home this episode.”</p>



<p>We wish Beverly all the best, and we&#8217;ll keep you updated as new information becomes available.</p>



<p>Of the eliminated contestants, two of those cuts were not very surprising. </p>

<p>But Grant appeared to be developing a real connection with Chloie. And fans quickly took to social media offer their condolences to the NYC-based model.</p>



<p>But hey, Grant&#8217;s doing what he has to do on his quest to the altar.</p>

<p>In week two, Grant parted ways with another four women.</p>



<p>Allyshia, Ella, Rebekah, and Vicky all got sent home following a very emotional rose ceremony.</p>



<p>Ella, a luxury travel host from Los Angeles, seemed to take the news the hardest. </p>



<p>After reassuring herself that she <em>would</em> get a rose, she seemed genuinely shocked when Grant chose to go in a different direction.</p>

<p>The rest of the cast probably would&#8217;ve preferred to see Zoe pack her bags. But hey, this wouldn&#8217;t be a season of <em>The Bachelor</em> without a good villain!</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t the first time that Grant was forced to make some hard decisions:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-got-sent-home-on-the-bachelor-week-1">Who Got Sent Home on &#8216;The Bachelor&#8217; Week 1?</h2>



<p>In week one, the casualties included at least one cast member whom X commenters predicted would make it through to the final rounds.</p>



<p>But it wouldn&#8217;t be a season of <em>The Bachelor </em>without a whole bunch of surprises.</p>



<p>And even the No-Drama Llama couldn&#8217;t save these 25 women from the pain of being left roseless at the end of the night.</p>

<p>It was a cocktail party with consequences as Grant&#8217;s journey to the altar got underway in frantic fashion.</p>



<p>As usual, the women lobbied for one-on-one time, and some first impressions just weren&#8217;t strong enough to earn a ticket to night two.</p>



<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s check out the full list of women who did not receive roses on Grant&#8217;s first night as Bachelor.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s a shame, as we were looking forward to seeing more of her Bollywood-inspired dance moves.</p>

<p>Next we have J&#8217;Nae, an Account Coordinator from Colorado Springs, Colorado who says her love language is FaceTime.</p>



<p>Alas, J&#8217;Nae wasn&#8217;t able to score much facetime with Grant on night one.</p>



<p>As a result, she climbed right back into the limo at the end of the evening.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#8217;s Christina, a Marketing Director from Fargo, North Dakota who says her biggest career goal is to start a clothing line inspired by her grandparents.</p>



<p>We suppose the silver lining is that she&#8217;ll have more time to devote to that project after not receiving a rose from Grant on night one.</p>



<p>So there you have it, folks. The pool of contestants has already been winnowed down from 25 to 18.</p>



<p>And if all goes according to plan, Grant will be popping the question to one lucky lady in his season finale.</p>



<p>Keep it locked on THG as we continue to update you on all of this season&#8217;s triumphs and tears.</p>

<p>Grant Ellis is here to spoil his upcoming season of The Bachelor.</p>



<p>Kinda. Sorta.</p>



<p>Okay, not <em>really</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/the-bachelor-grant-ellis-main-012225-101974a2ad6043a4a1f8a27f44172dcf.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-517916" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/the-bachelor-grant-ellis-main-012225-101974a2ad6043a4a1f8a27f44172dcf.jpg 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/the-bachelor-grant-ellis-main-012225-101974a2ad6043a4a1f8a27f44172dcf-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Welcome to Bachelor Nation, Grant Ellis!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Disney/John Fleenor)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, ahead of his Monday night premiere as The Bachelor on Season 29 of this beloved reality show, Ellis was asked by People Magazine about how his run of episodes will come to an end.</p>



<p>Did he find love? Is he engaged?!?</p>



<p>With the season having wrapped up filming months ago, Ellis <em>does</em>, of course, have the answers to these questions.</p>



<p>But he isn&#8217;t about to spill very much tea in public, not until we get a lot farther on his journey this winter and spring at least.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="848" height="567" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/image002-2-e1723512887402.webp" alt="Grant Ellis poses here for an ABC promotional photo." class="wp-image-506990" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/image002-2-e1723512887402.webp 848w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/image002-2-e1723512887402-300x201.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/image002-2-e1723512887402-768x514.webp 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis poses here for an ABC promotional photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Disney/Ricky Middlesworth)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Without giving away too much, things ended the way they were supposed to end, and I&#8217;m happy with it,” the 31-year old <a href="https://people.com/the-bachelor-grant-ellis-says-his-season-ended-how-it-was-supposed-to-exclusive-8779754">said this week to People</a>, adding in vague but intriguing fashion: </p>



<p>“I&#8217;m happy with decisions I made, and I don&#8217;t regret anything. I&#8217;m very happy with the ending.”</p>



<p>Importantly, Ellis appears to have his family’s support, as well. </p>



<p>“They&#8217;re happy for me,” he continued. “They&#8217;re happy for this whole experience, and I think that they&#8217;re happy to see me healing from things that happened in my life and doing it in a way where maybe it&#8217;ll inspire some people.”</p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-bachelor-season-29-come-on-down-grant-ellis/">Ellis was named the second-ever African-American</a> to anchor the long-running franchise.</p>



<p>He rose to small screen fame as a contestant this past season on The Bachelorette, advancing pretty far but getting the boot by lead Jenn Tran prior to hometown date week.</p>



<p>“I want a family, you know?” Grant said on the August 12 episode of The Bachelorette.</p>



<p>“I want to be happy. I want a wife. I want to be in love. I want that, you know? I want to give everything to somebody, and I want them to give everything to me in return. I don’t know what else to say. I did not think that was going to happen tonight.”</p>



<p>Now, Ellis himself will be in control of what comes next and who goes home.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="547" height="477" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-The-Bachelor1723521675-0.png" alt="Grant Ellis gets a rose" class="wp-image-507102" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-The-Bachelor1723521675-0.png 547w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-The-Bachelor1723521675-0-300x262.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis gets a rose here on The Bachelorette.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“For me, a red flag is somebody who&#8217;s too self-absorbed,” Ellis told People of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/grant-ellis-to-bachelor-nation-hi-here-is-what-im-seeking-in-a-wife/">what he wants in a spouse</a>. </p>



<p>“I like when somebody&#8217;s compassionate and somebody has a heart for other people because that&#8217;s the way I am, so I feel like it has to mesh with how I feel. And then hygiene is a big thing for me, too!&#8221;</p>



<p>A native of Houston, Ellis was described as follows via a previous ABC press release:</p>



<p>“A self-proclaimed mama’s boy, Ellis’ infectious smile and unwavering positivity instantly brightens every room he enters.</p>



<p>“The former pro basketball player is passionate about his career as a day trader, but when he’s not immersed in the fast-paced world of finance, you can find him cheering on the Lakers, hitting strikes at the bowling alley, or belting out tunes at karaoke nights.”</p>

<p>Well, a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/the-bachelor-season-29-cast-meet-the-women-who-will-compete-for-grant-ellis-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new season of <em>The Bachelor</em></a> gets underway tonight. </p>



<p>And that means it&#8217;s time for the show&#8217;s star to get mercilessly interrogated by Kelly Ripa!</p>



<p>Yes, in what&#8217;s become a rite of passage for new Bachelors and Bachelorettes, Grant Ellis made an appearance on Kelly&#8217;s show today, where she asked one very important question: WTF are you thinking?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="584" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-1024x584.png" alt="Grant Ellis gets interviewed by Kelly Ripa." class="wp-image-517910" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-1024x584.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-300x171.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-768x438.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-2048x1169.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-960x548.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-1080x616.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-27-at-4.36.27-PM-1200x685.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis gets interviewed by Kelly Ripa.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC/YouTube screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kelly-ripa-is-not-a-fan-of-dating-shows">Kelly Ripa Is Not a Fan of Dating Shows</h2>



<p>To be fair, Kelly is never mean about it. In fact, she praised Grant effusively throughout their interview.</p>



<p>She just thinks dating shows are a dumb idea, and everyone involved would be better off going on Tinder. She might have a point there!</p>



<p>“I’m going to kick off with my usual question,” Kelly said to Grant. “I’m sure they prepped you for me. Thirty-one years old, look at this guy. Gorgeous.”</p>



<p>Kelly&#8217;s husband and co-host, Mark Consuelos, chimed in, “Good-looking guy. Tall.”</p>

<p>“Former pro basketball player. Why are you on a dating show? I could get you married in three minutes. I could get you married yesterday, a week ago, six months ago.”</p>



<p>Consuelos argued that he and Ripa could match Ellis up with a young lady “by the end of the show.&#8221; Kelly claimed that they “could have a melange of women here” ready for him.</p>



<p>&#8220;And some men,&#8221; Mark added.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grant-tells-his-tale">Grant Tells His Tale</h2>



<p>Grant explained that he was once in a seven-year relationship. When that ended he was &#8220;single for a while,&#8221; and it was his mother who decided that he should take his chances on TV.</p>



<p>“And then my mom, she saw <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/gerry-turner-divorced-golden-bachelor-lead-finalizes-split-from-theresa-nist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Golden Bachelor</a></em>, and she signed me up,” he shared.</p>



<p>“For <em>The Golden Bachelor</em>?!” a confused Kelly asked (via <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kelly-ripa-questions-why-gorgeous-155536742.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo! News</a>).</p>



<p>Grant clarified that his mother encouraged him to sign up for the OG version of the show. And apparently, that&#8217;s how he got cast on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jenn-tran-dating-dwts-partner-sasha-farber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenn Tran</a>&#8216;s season of <em>The Bachelorette</em>.</p>

<p>“That’s when I was like, I’m going to do it,” Grant explained. “Might find my person, might not, but that’s how it happened.”</p>



<p>“Either way, it’s going to launch your TV career. Because look at that face! That’s ridiculous,&#8221; Kelly gushed.</p>



<p>So yeah, Kelly is not a big believer in the <em>Bachelor</em> process. And given how few successful marriages this franchise has yielded, we don&#8217;t blame her.</p>



<p>But she is a big believer in Grant. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll get to see the start of his quest for love at 8 pm tonight on ABC. We wish him all the best.</p>

<p>ABC made history this week. Twice.</p>



<p>First, the network surprised viewers by revealing the identity of next season&#8217;s The Bachelor lead far earlier than usual.</p>



<p>Second, it did so by revealing him to be <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/the-bachelor-season-29-come-on-down-grant-ellis/">Grant Ellis</a>, only the second African-American to ever hold this title.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="547" height="477" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-The-Bachelor1723521675-0.png" alt="Grant Ellis gets a rose" class="wp-image-507102" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-The-Bachelor1723521675-0.png 547w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-The-Bachelor1723521675-0-300x262.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis get a rose here on The Bachelorette.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“We are announcing Grant so quickly so people can still apply to be on his season,” producer Robert Mills Tweeted after the announcement went viral. “If you think Grant is potentially the man of your dreams or you know someone who is apply ASAP!!!”</p>



<p>Fair enough.</p>



<p>If women are gonna vie for Ellis&#8217; heart, however, after the 30-year old day trader was eliminated by Jenn Tran on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a>&#8230; they need to know what he&#8217;s seeking in a potential spouse, right?</p>



<p>Take it away, Grant Ellis!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a love that&#8217;s kind and understanding. Some qualities I&#8217;m looking for in a potential partner is somebody who&#8217;s adventurous, somebody who&#8217;s affectionate and somebody who&#8217;s loving,&#8221; Ellis said on a Good Morning America appearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for this incredible journey to get kicked off; it&#8217;s going to be so fun and I hope you guys tune in. Peace!&#8221;</p>



<p>A press release from ABC Entertainment said Ellis &#8220;is eager to embark on a journey filled with romance, adventure, and genuine connections.&#8221;</p>



<p>It added that &#8220;he hopes to find a partner who shares his values of loyalty, humor and a deep appreciation for life’s simple pleasures.&#8221;</p>

<p>On The Bachelorette, Ellis admitted that he was falling in love with Tran.</p>



<p>He was sent packing a week before the hometown-date episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;I poured everything out and it wasn&#8217;t good enough,” he told the cameras. “It just sucks knowing that you feel some way about somebody, and they don’t feel the same about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>It does, absolutely.</p>



<p>But Ellis will be in control of his own romantic journey when The Bachelor premieres in early 2025.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="686" height="407" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-Jenn-Tran-237368.jpg" alt="Grant Ellis on ABC" class="wp-image-507103" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-Jenn-Tran-237368.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/Grant-Ellis-Jenn-Tran-237368-300x178.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Grant Ellis gets pinned with a rose by Jenn Tran.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>During an interview with Joe Amabile and Serena Pitt on the Bachelor Happy Hour Podcast in July, Ellis said that his favorite thing about Tran was &#8220;her ability to make a situation easy and how she lights up the room and how witty she is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Here are a few facts about Grant Ellis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>He&#8217;s a New Jersey native who now lives in Houston.</li>



<li>He played basketball at Iona College, Southern University and Albertus Magnus College and then went on to play professionally in Puerto Rico, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.</li>



<li>Ellis works as a day trader. While he&#8217;s &#8220;passionate&#8221; about his new career, his ABC Bachelor biography says &#8220;he loves watching the Lakers, going bowling, and singing his heart out at karaoke&#8221; when he &#8220;isn&#8217;t hustling at his job.&#8221;</li>

<p>Grant Ellis has accepted a rose from ABC.</p>



<p>In a manner of speaking.</p>



<p>Following his somewhat surprising exit from the latest season of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a>, this 30-year old from Houston was named the star of The Bachelor Season 29.</p>

<p>As such, Ellis becomes the second-ever African-American to anchor the long-running franchise.</p>



<p>“A self-proclaimed mama’s boy, Ellis’ infectious smile and unwavering positivity instantly brightens every room he enters,” read ABC‘s official description of its new lead. </p>



<p>“The former pro basketball player is passionate about his career as a day trader, but when he’s not immersed in the fast-paced world of finance, you can find him cheering on the Lakers, hitting strikes at the bowling alley, or belting out tunes at karaoke nights.”</p>



<p>While pursuing Jenn Tran as a contestant on The Bachelorette, Ellis spoke to Tran about the impact his dad&#8217;s substance abuse issues had on him, while Tran described her struggles with her absent father.</p>



<p>There seemed to be a connection &#8212; heck, Ellis even said he was falling in love &#8212; but then Tran sent Grant packing prior to next week&#8217;s hometown date episode.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a family, you know?&#8221; he said on the August 12 episode of The Bachelorette. </p>



<p>&#8220;I want to be happy. I want a wife. I want to be in love. I want that, you know? I want to give everything to somebody, and I want them to give everything to me in return. I don&#8217;t know what else to say. I did not think that was going to happen tonight.&#8221;</p>



<p>Added Ellis after his elimination:</p>



<p>“I poured everything out and it wasn&#8217;t good enough. It just sucks knowing that you feel some way about somebody, and they don’t feel the same about you.”</p>



<p>Looking ahead, however, as The Bachelor himself, Ellis will be in control of this emotional process.</p>



<p>As he steps into the role, ABC notes that “Ellis is eager to embark on a journey filled with romance, adventure, and genuine connections. </p>



<p>&#8220;He hopes to find a partner who shares his values of loyalty, humor and a deep appreciation for life’s simple pleasures.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Grant Ellis has that hope.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re also sure, based on the history of this series, that it won&#8217;t actually be realized. But, hey, we&#8217;re rooting for the guy! He seems nice and genuine.</p>



<p><strong>The Bachelor Season 29 will likely premiere in January of 2025.</strong></p>

<p>Before it hits the air, however, Joan Vassos will star on the first-ever season of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-golden-bachelorette/">The Golden Bachelorette</a>.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a privilege to be a mom to four amazing kids and a grandmother (they call me Jojo) to two beautiful grandchildren. But once a mom, always a mom and sometimes the timing doesn&#8217;t work out with finding love,” the new reality star wrote on her Instagram Story in October. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone at home is doing great and I hope one day I will get the chance at love again.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>The Golden Bachelorette premieres Wednesday, September 18, at 8/7c on ABC.</strong></p>
