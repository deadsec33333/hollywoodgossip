<p>Garth Brooks is a divorced man. He has been for many years.</p>



<p>But the concern now is that, given the shocking new allegations against him, Garth will be divorced twice over. </p>



<p>For months there has been concern about his marriage, ever since Trisha Yearwood walked <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/garth-brooks-skips-cmt-awards-trisha-yearwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the red carpet at the CMT Awards</a> alone.</p>

<p>Then, on October 3, 2024, a bombshell <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/garth-brooks-responds-to-ugly-rape-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a> came to light, with a woman claiming Garth actually raped her in 2019. It&#8217;s far from the first time this year that a beloved musician has been accused of stepping out on his marriage (cough &#8212; Dave Grohl &#8212; cough), but this is far worse than an affair.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/garth-brooks-cancel-concert-jimmy-kimmel/">Garth canceled a concert</a> and a scheduled <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> performance, seemingly in response to the allegations.</p>



<p>These are violent accusations against Garth. Can his marriage survive this? Here&#8217;s what we know so far. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-garth-brooks-and-trisha-yearwood-still-together">Are Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood Still Together?</h2>



<p>Everyone, take a deep breath: Garth and Trisha are indeed still together &#8212; for the time being.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="734" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836758-1024x734.jpg" alt="Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood attend the 17th Academy Of Country Music Honors at Ryman Auditorium on August 21, 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee.

<p>Late last year, news broke that the beloved country star had&nbsp;been&nbsp;accused of sexual assault and battery&nbsp;by a woman who identified herself in a new lawsuit as one of the country star&#8217;s former hairstylists and makeup artists.</p>



<p>A copy of the lawsuit,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/entertainment/garth-brooks-accused-sexual-assault/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by CNN</a>, explained that &#8220;Jane Roe&#8221; is accusing Garth of raping her during a work trip in 2019. </p>



<p>Immediately, there was widespread concern, given that Garth has been happily married to Trisha for nearly 20 years. He swiftly denied the claims in a lengthy statement to the public.</p>



<p>&#8220;I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be,” he said. </p>



<p>But Trisha has yet to release any kind of statement, nor has she posted anything on social media about the accusations yet. But &#8220;yet&#8221; seems to be the operative word, given that, just a few days earlier, the couple were gushing about their love.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-love-story">Their Love Story </h2>



<p>Garth and Trisha made their first public appearance as a couple at the 33rd Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Awards Induction in New York City in 2002 after years of being friends. </p>



<p>Three years later, the pair were married and have been dutifully by each other&#8217;s side every day since. </p>

<p>Garth has been very open about the love he has for his family. Just ahead of his 18th wedding anniversary, he gushed about his wife and his kids during an appearance on&nbsp;<em>The Kelly Clarkson Show</em>&nbsp;in November 2023.</p>



<p>“When it comes to the future, I think what you’re just grateful for is just one more day, right? Of getting to do this,” the country icon said. </p>



<p>“So, I think that’s it. What I’d love to say is, the day I take my last breath on this planet, I’d love for my three girls to be around me and I’d love for the queen to be around me.”</p>



<p>A few weeks later, he showed Trisha just how much she meant to him on their actual anniversary date with a special gift. </p>



<p>&#8220;When your husband sends you flowers and you send him flowers and the card says exactly the same thing! #happy18 #love #morethanever,&#8221; Trisha captioned her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trishayearwood/?hl=en">Instagram</a> post.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-garth-shows-love-to-trisha">Garth Shows Love To Trisha</h2>



<p>But then, just a few short days before the lawsuit was filed,&nbsp;<a href="https://parade.com/celebrities/trisha-yearwood-garth-brooks-jimmy-carter-100th-birthday-habitat-humanity-interview"><em>Parade</em>&nbsp;Magazine</a>&nbsp;spoke with the famous country crooner couple about their marriage. </p>



<p>When asked about their milestone 20th&nbsp;anniversary&nbsp;next year, Garth said he believes he and Trisha have the &#8220;greatest love story in the history of the planet.&#8221;</p>



<p>So if there was trouble ahead, he wasn&#8217;t going to acknowledge it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-garth-brooks-has-been-divorced-his-marriage-before-trisha">Garth Brooks Has Been Divorced: His Marriage Before Trisha</h2>



<p>Then again, if things go south, it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time for Garth</p>



<p>Garth and Trisha first met in the late &#8217;80s when they started working together on a demo together. At the time, they were both married to other people.</p>



<p>Garth was married for 15 years to songwriter Sandy Mahl before they split. They had three children together and seemed perfectly happy to everyone on the outside of their marriage. </p>



<p>But in the end, Garth divorced the first Mrs. Brooks citing irreconcilable differences.</p>



<p>Now, before you start thinking Trisha had anything to do with it, think again. Sandy has been clear that her former husband&#8217;s explosive career was the issue. </p>

<p id="eBZ_cZWB590X">&#8220;People constantly wanting your attention and yanking and pulling on him,&#8221; she explained in the documentary&nbsp;<em>Garth Brooks: The Road I&#8217;m On.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p id="eChMbFaEeOmU">&#8220;He&#8217;d be gone eight to 10 weeks at a time. He&#8217;d come home, and there would be number-one parties, or shows, or CMAs, or ACMs, American Music Awards, so it was constantly going. But we both grew apart really, really quickly.</p>



<p>As for Trisha, she was married to two others before she found her forever love with Garth: her first husband,&nbsp;Christopher Latham, from 1987 to 1991, and to her second husband,&nbsp;Robert Reynolds, from 1994 to 1999.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only time will tell for sure if these two can&#8217;t make it work in the face of scandal. We&#8217;ll keep you updated as we learn more. </p>

<p>It looks like Garth Brooks had to cancel a major performance.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s easy to guess why.</p>



<p>On October 3, a woman filed a lawsuit <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/garth-brooks-responds-to-ugly-rape-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusing Garth Brooks of sexual assault</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-concert-did-garth-brooks-cancel">What concert did Garth Brooks cancel?</h2>



<p>Though Garth Brook played at his Las Vegas residency in early October, he has been keeping a low profile for weeks.</p>



<p>Previously, his fans had expected for this to change on Monday, November 25. Just days ahead of Thanksgiving, he would have performed on <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jimmy-kimmel-cries-2024-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a></em> for a small crowd and for viewers at home.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/12927726/garth-brooks-concert-jimmy-kimmel-canceled-rape-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The US Sun</em> reports</a> that the concert has been canceled. Not postponed or rescheduled &#8212; canceled.</p>

<p>Previously, 1iota &#8212; the live audience company &#8212; had been advertising the Garth Brooks concert. Fans received tickets to see the Jimmy Kimmel show until ticket-holders received an update on Tuesday, November 19.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, the Garth Brooks Outdoor Mini-Concert at Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday, 11/25 has been canceled and will no longer proceed as scheduled,” the message to ticket-holders announced.</p>



<p>“Television production decisions can fluctuate due to a variety of reasons,&#8221; the announcement said vaguely. “We hate delivering disappointing news, and we hope you will join us in the future for another exciting fan experience.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-lawsuit-allege-about-garth-brooks">What does the lawsuit allege about Garth Brooks?</h2>



<p>The message added: “Unfortunately, in the world of television, these things sometimes happen. This event will not be rescheduled.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In early October, an unnamed woman filed a lawsuit against Garth Brooks. She described having worked for his wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/trisha-yearwood-kids-garth-brooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trisha Yearwood</a>, since 1999. In 2017, her filing details, she began working for Brooks.</p>



<p>According to her lawsuit, she and Brooks traveled from Nashville to Los Angeles for his Grammy Awards performance in October 2019. </p>

<p>The filing alleges that the two were alone on his private jet, and that he&#8217;d booked one hotel suite for them to share. According to her, he appeared naked in the doorway of the suite&#8217;s bedroom and sexually assaulted her.</p>



<p>The allegations within the lawsuit claim that Brooks then proceeded to act as if nothing had happened. This meant that she was then expected to do hair and makeup work as before.</p>



<p>Brooks has denied the allegations. He also released a statement insinuating that this has been a blackmail attempt, and that the lawsuit follows months of &#8220;threats&#8221; and &#8220;lies&#8221; attempting to extort millions from him.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-legal-battle-could-last-for-months-or-even-years">This legal battle could last for months or even years</h2>



<p>In September, Garth Brooks filed a lawsuit in federal court attempting to anonymously preempt the October filing. As John Doe, he alleged that Jane Roe (also a pseudonym) was making allegations that were &#8220;wholly untrue.&#8221;</p>



<p>This filing accused his accuser of “intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, and false light invasion of privacy.”</p>



<p>Thus far, the public has not seen any evidence in the case. Garth Brooks has a good reputation, and many are noting that this could be an extortion case. Of course, anyone could turn out to have a dark side, and so many are reluctant to give the benefit of the doubt &#8212; no matter a person&#8217;s public image.</p>

<p>Was this our first sign of trouble ahead?! </p>



<p>Trisha Yearwood received a major honor at CMT Awards in April. No surprise there, she is an icon in the country music scene. </p>



<p>But what did surprise of fans was that  her husband Garth Brooks was nowhere to be seen!</p>



<p>A few months later, it was announced that an anonymous former stylist of Trisha&#8217;s was suing Garth for sexual assault! </p>



<p>Now, as everyone starts questioning the future of Garth&#8217;s marriage, fans are looking back at what could&#8217;ve been the warning signs this past year. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-trisha-yearwood-attend-the-cmt-awards-without-garth-brooks">Why Did Trisha Yearwood Attend the CMT Awards Without Garth Brooks?</h2>



<p>Trisha was on hand to receive the first annual June Carter Cash Humanitarian Award.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a60423180/why-isnt-garth-brooks-at-the-cmt-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Living</a></em>, Trisha received the award as a result of her work with Habitat for Humanity, Dottie’s Yard, Stanford Women’s Cancer Center, the American Cancer Society, and the Humane Society.</p>



<p>She also performed &#8220;Put It in a Song,&#8221; the lead single from her upcoming album.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it was a big night for Trisha.</p>



<p>But to the shock of many fans, she was joined not by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/garth-brooks-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her husband of 19 years</a> but by her sister, Beth Bernard.</p>

<p>Initially, Trisha did not offer a reason for Garth&#8217;s absence.</p>



<p>On Instagram, she merely posted a photo of herself and her sister with a caption reading, &#8220;Girls night!!&#8221;</p>



<p>But according to <em><a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/trisha-yearwood-at-the-2024-cmt-awards-without-garth-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a></em>, Trisha stated on the red carpet that Garth is probably at the bar the couple recently opened in Nashville.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-garth-and-trisha-s-new-business-venture">Garth and Trisha&#8217;s New Business Venture</h2>



<p>Yes, Garth and Trisha are now the proud owners of the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/garth-brooks-trisha-yearwood-reality-show-friends-in-low-places/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends in Low Places Bar &amp; Honky Tonk</a>.</p>



<p>The venture is the subject of a recent Amazon Prime reality show, which documents the challenges the couple faced in opening the four-story establishment.</p>



<p>“This was so much more than I bargained for. With that said, what we have built is far more than just a business,” Brooks remarks in the series, adding:</p>

<p>“This is by far, the craziest ride I have ever been on.”</p>



<p>They may have reached an age when many couples start slowing down, but it seems that Garth and Trisha are just getting started.</p>



<p>In addition to the bar and her many humanitarian projects, Trisha is the host of the long-running Food Network series <em>Trisha&#8217;s Southern Kitchen</em>.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s also a devoted <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/trisha-yearwood-kids-garth-brooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepmom to Garth&#8217;s three children</a> &#8212; and, of course, there&#8217;s always the music.</p>



<p>One would think that  bar ownership would be enough to put any relationship to the test &#8211; but unfortunately, that was just the beginning of their troubles.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-garth-and-trisha">What&#8217;s Next For Garth and Trisha?</h2>



<p>It is a complicated time for Trisha and Garth, to say the least.</p>



<p>In early October 2024, Garth was accused of sexual assault and battery in a lawsuit from a “Jane Roe” who says she worked as a hairstylist and makeup artist for the award-winning singer.</p>



<p>Garth has fiercely denied all of the allegations, claiming this woman sent him a demand letter, threatening to go public with her claims and sue him unless he paid him millions of dollars.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Trisha has not addressed the subject directly, but it does seem like she’s prepared to stand by her man. A few weeks after the claims were&nbsp; made, she posted a photo of herself performing with Garth on Instagram.</p>



<p>The caption read: “Love One Another #Vegas.”</p>



<p>Garth is currently performing a residency at Caesars Palace and it looks like the scandal hasn’t stopped the pair from performing together. .</p>

<p>Garth Brooks has been accused of sexual assault.</p>



<p>On October 3, an unnamed woman filed a lawsuit that claimed she worked as the iconic singer&#8217;s makeup artist and stylist beginning in 2017; the woman also says she was hired to do wife Trisha Yearwood&#8217;s makeup in 1999.</p>



<p>In the legal document, the woman alleges Brooks raped her&#8230; undressed in her presence&#8230; exposed his genitals and buttocks&#8230; and openly spoke about sex and sexual fantasies in numerous incidents five years ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510600" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2167836733-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks attend the 17th Academy Of Country Music Honors at Ryman Auditorium on August 21, 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for ACM)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Brooks increased the frequency of his sexually charged conversations with Ms. Roe, and this included his repeated remarks about having a threesome with his wife in which he implied that Ms. Roe would be the third person,&#8221; the alleged victim wrote in her lawsuit.</p>



<p>Jane Roe says she stopped working for Brooks and moved to Mississippi around May 2021.</p>



<p>On Thursday night, Brooks issued a statement to in response to this horrible allegation.</p>



<p>&#8220;For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face,&#8221; this message opens.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510601" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1703473684-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Garth Brooks speaks on stage during NSAI 2023 Nashville Songwriter Awards at Ryman Auditorium on September 26, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Danielle Del Valle/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the most successful country artist of all-time, Brooks added:</p>



<p>“Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of — ugly acts no human should ever do to another. </p>



<p>&#8220;We filed suit against this person nearly a month ago to speak out against extortion and defamation of character. </p>



<p>&#8220;We filed it anonymously for the sake of families on both sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although this marks the singer&#8217;s first time speaking publicly about the lawsuit, he previously denied the lady&#8217;s claims in a complaint filed with the intention of blocking her accusations from going viral. </p>



<p>In that filing, Brooks said this woman was a “lying extortionist who intended on destroying his professional reputation,&#8221; and it went on as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;[Her] allegations are not true. [She] is well aware, however, of the substantial, irreparable damage such false allegations would do to Plaintiff’s well-earned reputation as a decent and caring person, along with the unavoidable damage to his family and the irreparable damage to his career and livelihood that would result if she made good on her threat to &#8216;publicly file&#8217; her fabricated lawsuit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Indeed, such knowledge no doubt explains why [she] threatened to file suit through a &#8216;confidential&#8217; demand letter rather than simply filing suit to redress her alleged (but untrue) injuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>On October 3, Brooks concluded his reply in this manner:</p>



<p><em>I want to play music tonight. I want to continue our good deeds going forward. It breaks my heart these wonderful things are in question now. </em></p>



<p><em>I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be</em>.</p>



<p>Yearwood, who married Brooks in 2005, has not yet addressed this scandal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-garth-brooks-has-three-kids-and-trisha-yearwood-is-their-stepmother">Garth Brooks has three kids, and Trisha Yearwood is their stepmother</h2>



<p>Amazon Prime Video&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/shiny-happy-people-producers-uncovered-more-sinister-secrets-could-make-more-episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addition to the reality TV world</a> is <em>Friends In Low Places</em>, following Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood as they &#8212; and friends and employees &#8212; work to open a new bar &amp; honky tonk in Nashville.</p>



<p>This is about more than Brooks&#8217; music legacy and the power of <em>his </em>name recognition. Yearwood&#8217;s culinary expertise is making sure that the menu of favorites is top-notch.</p>



<p>However, most couples&#8217; most important collaboration will always be their children. Garth Brooks has three adult daughters: Taylor, August, and Colleen. </p>

<p>Trisha Yearwood became the stepmother to all three girls after she married their father in late 2005.</p>



<p>In fact, all three of Brooks&#8217; daughters participated in the wedding ceremony. Considering how awkward celebrity remarriage drama can be, that was a positive sign.</p>



<p>Trisha herself has two ex-husbands: Chris Latham from 1987 to 1991, and The Mavericks bassist Robert Reynolds from 1994 to 1999. In contrast, her marriage to Brooks has now spanned nearly two decades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-mayne-pearl-brooks">Taylor Mayne Pearl Brooks</h2>



<p>Garth Brooks and ex-wife Sandy Mahl welcomed their first child, Taylor Mayne Pearl Brooks, on July 8, 1992. </p>



<p>Her parents named her in honor of musician James Taylor and comedian Minnie Pearl. Unlike her parents and namesakes, however, Taylor has not sought the spotlight in any way.</p>



<p>Their eldest daughter has lived a normal life. In 2016, she graduated from Oklahoma State University (just like her father) with a Bachelor&#8217;s in history. In 2020, she received her Master&#8217;s degree from Vanderbilt University.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-august-anna-brooks">August Anna Brooks</h2>



<p>On May 13, 1994, Garth Brooks and ex-wife Sandy Mahl welcomed their second child, August Anna Brooks. </p>



<p>Like her elder sister, August attended Oklahoma State University. She pursued a legal career, fulfilling her longtime aspiration by soon working for a law firm.</p>



<p>One major standout for August is that she is also a parent. She gave her parents two grandchildren: Karalynn in 2013 and Gwendolyn in 2016. She shares both daughters with husband and high school sweetheart Chance Michael Russell.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-allie-colleen-brooks">Allie Colleen Brooks</h2>



<p>Garth Brooks and ex-wife Sandy Mahl welcomed their third child, Allie Colleen Brooks, on July 28, 1996 &#8212; just three years before the couple separated. The &#8220;Colleen&#8221; in her name is apparently a reference to &#8220;Jolene,&#8221; one of living legend Dolly Parton&#8217;s most iconic songs.</p>



<p>Like her middle sister, Colleen is married. She and Johnathan Roberts married in 2018.</p>



<p>However, as you might notice from her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C33J8mTPFqe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page, Colleen stands out from both of her sisters in one major way.</p>

<p>Colleen does not seem to be camera-shy in the slightest. In fact, she takes after her parents, and especially her dad, as she has her own music career.</p>



<p>Her nascent music career has already seen success. After graduating from Belmont University in 2018, “Ain’t the Only Hell (My Momma Raised)” hit the Top 40 on the Mediabase charts in 2020. </p>



<p>Whether people call her a chip off of the old block or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/tori-spelling-marks-90210-anniversary-gets-super-defensive-about-nepo-baby-accusations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nepo baby</a>, Colleen is making a name for herself. But so are her sisters, in their own ways.</p>

<p>Are you hyped for the Garth Brooks reality show?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s more to Amazon Prime Video&#8217;s catalogue than jaw-dropping big budget drama storytelling and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/shiny-happy-people-producers-uncovered-more-sinister-secrets-could-make-more-episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must-watch documentaries</a>. </p>



<p>The 2024 reality series stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, but makes the opening of his new bar the heart of the show.</p>



<p><em>Friends In Low Places</em> speaks to decades of Brooks&#8217; legacy. But it wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without the team working to make this dream a reality.</p>

<p>Garth Brooks and his wife, Trisha Yearwood, have been pulling out all of the stops to open the Friends in Low Places Bar &amp; Honky-Tonk. The bar takes its name for one of the singer&#8217;s most iconic songs.</p>



<p>(A &#8220;honky-tonk&#8221; generally refers to a disreputable bar or dance hall and tends to involve Country music; we suspect that Brooks&#8217; establishment is <em>plenty </em>reputable)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not enough for them to open the establishment in Nashville&#8217;s Lower Broadway. They&#8217;re also opening the doors for a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/shiny-happy-people-duggar-documentary-shatters-viewership-records-producers-vow-to-dig-up-more-dirt-on-jim-bob-and-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video docuseries</a>.</p>

<p>The reality show,<em> Friends in Low Places</em>, will follow Garth Brooks and Trish Yearwood and others as they build this four-story bar from scratch. You can watch the trailer for the series below.</p>



<p>“This was so much more than I bargained for. With that said, what we have built is far more than just a business,” Brooks commented. </p>



<p>He added: “This is by far, the craziest ride I have ever been on.”</p>

<p>As for the rest of the cast, we&#8217;ll be watching as Garth Brooks&#8217; touring team and Strategic Hospitality group tag along. Benjamin and Max Goldberg are the brothers behind a recent surge in Nashville&#8217;s dining scene, so they will be overseeing the Friends In Low Places hospitality situation.</p>



<p>Jenny Deathridge Bratt and Camille Tambunting are both go-getters for Strategic HOspitality, so they&#8217;ll be overseeing the build out directly.</p>



<p>“If you are one of the lucky ones who come to this town and receive its many blessings, don’t you owe something to Nashville?” Brooks proposed, before referring to himself in the third person. “Garth Brooks owes a lot to Music City.”</p>

<p>The 54,715-square-foot establishment will be the largest on Broadway.</p>



<p>It sounds like the &#8220;classic honky-tonk&#8221; tone of the bar will definitely feel appropriate for Nashville, with live music and space for dancing. For some, that&#8217;s sensory hell &#8212; but for others, it&#8217;s a huge part of the appeal.</p>



<p>Notably, the menu is particularly special, because Trisha Yearwood whipped up some of Brooks&#8217; favorites. It helps when your wife is the host of <em>Trisha&#8217;s Southern Kitchen</em> on the Food Network and also a bestselling cookbook author.</p>

<p>“We started down this road fueled by passion, dedication, and a shared vision,” Yearwood praised.</p>



<p>“I’m really proud of the team that has built the Friends Bar and Honky Tonk,&#8221; she expressed. </p>



<p>Yearwood concluded: &#8220;We are excited to share the culmination of everyone’s efforts. It’s even bigger than we dreamed.”</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="/stars/robin-roberts/">Robin Roberts</a> on Good Morning America today, Garth Brooks announced that he&#8217;ll soon be playing new music for fans around the nation.</p>

<p>“You know what, since it’s you and since we’ve had a history forever, let’s announce it. We’re going on a world tour in 2014,” Brooks said to the reporter. “I can’t believe I just did that, but you are a doll.”</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>

</div>
<p>Brooks added that he needed the go-ahead from wife Trisha Yearwood before making this major decision.</p>
<p>“It sure feels good to get to throw your hat back in the ring,” Brooks said.  “All my babies are fine with it. Ms. Yearwood is fine with it.  So now I get to do what I love to do, which is play music. I get to be with the person I want to be with, which is Ms. Yearwood.”</p>
<p>The singer is the best-selling album artist since SoundScan began tracking U.S. sales data in 1991 and announced his retirement from recording and performing in 2000.</p>
<p>But he has a six-disc set (“Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences&#8221;) coming out soon that includes covers, his greatest hits and a DVD of his Las Vegas show.</p>
<p>No tour dates have been released yet, but look for venue and ticket information to be made public in the very near future.</p>
