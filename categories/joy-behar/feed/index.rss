<p>Did Joy Behar effectively &#8220;out&#8221; Sara Haines over a &#8220;lesbian relationship&#8221; on <em>The View</em>?</p>



<p>(And in front of her parents?)</p>



<p>Amidst <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sunny-hostin-unrecognizable-in-the-view-season-28-promo-pic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent changes at <em>The View</em></a>, regular contributor Sara Haines stopped by during a recent episode. Joy brought up one of her previous relationships &#8212; and some are accusing her of effectively &#8220;outing&#8221; the beloved journalist. </p>



<p>Is that what happened? Did Joy Behar get into trouble?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-joy-behar-out-sara-haines-over-a-lesbian-relationship-in-her-past">Did Joy Behar &#8216;out&#8217; Sara Haines over a &#8216;lesbian relationship&#8217; in her past?</h2>



<p>On a memorable episode of <em>The View</em>, Sara Haines joined the panel. </p>



<p>Haines, who has been both a <em>The View </em>co-host and a <em>Good Morning America</em> host, discussed relationships with the others. They discussed exes and more &#8212; all while Haines&#8217; parents, Sandy and Dick Haines, were seated in the audience.</p>



<p>Joy Behar then asked Sara Haines: &#8220;I have to ask a question. Are you going to bring up that lesbian relationship you had or not? Back at Smith?&#8221; She was referring to Smith College.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-1024x576.png" alt="Sara Haines on The View in October 2024." class="wp-image-512439" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1101_sarahaines_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Accomplished journalism and television host Sara Haines rejoined The View for the October 30, 2024 episode ahead of the pivotal election.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In response, Sarah Haines burst out laughing. </p>



<p>Joy Behar has a blunt manner of asking questions, which can be funny. Laughter can also be a nervous response to feeling surprised or embarrassed.</p>



<p>Haines then quickly shouted to her parents, who were seated in the audience. &#8220;Dad, earmuffs!&#8221; she suggested. Many of us jokingly tell a friend to cover their ears in that fashion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joy-behar-s-co-hosts-called-her-out-over-it">Joy Behar&#8217;s co-hosts called her out over it</h2>



<p>Alyssa Farah Griffin called out Joy Behar, reminding her that Sara Haines&#8217; alleged past relationship was &#8220;off air&#8221; and not public information.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sunny-hostin-leaving-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunny Hostin</a> very realistically commented that &#8220;Now, it&#8217;s on air.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sara Haines did not choose to elaborate. Many people &#8212; most of whom may identify as straight &#8212; have same-sex relationships and hookups in their pasts. Most of the time, when someone chooses to not identify as anything other than straight, they also do not publicly disclose this in our deeply homophobic society.</p>



<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tv/article-14026147/The-View-Joy-Behar-crossed-line-bosses-exposed-Sara-Haines-lesbian-relationship.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that co-hosts went on to further criticize Joy Behar for &#8220;embarrassing&#8221; Sara Haines.</p>



<p>Allegedly, higher ups told Joy Behar that what she said was &#8220;not OK.&#8221; That&#8217;s according to <em>The Daily Mail</em>&#8216;s report.</p>



<p>Joy Behar has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/joy-behar-happy-to-be-fired-from-the-view-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gotten into trouble</a> at <em>The View</em> before. But did she receive professional backlash for what went down on that episode?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maybe-she-didn-t-get-into-trouble-after-all">Maybe she didn&#8217;t get into trouble after all</h2>



<p><em>Page Six</em> reports that, no, Joy Behar was &#8220;not reprimanded&#8221; for one clear reason.</p>



<p>“Sara freely shared the story with the studio audience last week, although it was off camera,” the inside source explained. “She did not have a private conversation about it with her co-hosts.”</p>



<p>In general, it&#8217;s best to clear something like that with a person before bringing it up. </p>



<p>However, if a famous person has already told a crowded room about something, it&#8217;s arguably no longer a <em>secret</em>.</p>

<p>Joy Behar has been a staple on <em>The View </em>for nearly 30 years, but is it <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/joy-behar-happy-to-be-fired-from-the-view-but-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time for her to pack it up</a>?</p>



<p>The comedian and talk show host recently marked her 82nd birthday on air, and while she&#8217;s been holding her own, a few followers shared messages saying that it was time for her to retire.</p>



<p>But is that really in her plans? And honestly, should it? As an OG member of the panel, shouldn&#8217;t she stick with the show as long as she wishes?</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we know:</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977-1024x683.jpg" alt="Joy Behar with Joe Biden On the view" class="wp-image-511594" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2173560977.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">US President Joe Biden (L) speaks with host Joy Behar during a commercial break in a live interview on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;The View&#8221; in New York on September 25, 2024. <span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP))</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joy-s-big-birthday">Joy&#8217;s Big Birthday</h2>



<p>Joy turned 82 on October 7, 2024, but a few days before, she had a special <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/whoopi-goldberg-leaving-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebration with her co-hosts </a>on <em>The View</em>. Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah-Griffin, and Ana Navaro all helped Joy begin her next trip around the sun.</p>



<p>As the ladies walked on stage, a huge birthday message for Joy was projected behind their table. The comic made a hilarious joke to start off the episode. </p>



<p>&#8220;I would tell you my age, but I think you might fact-check me,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>During the episode, they had a few moments to celebrate Joy&#8217;s birthday, including an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixnGbllyVAU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with her friend Nathan Lane. The iconic actor had a very sweet message for the talk show host on her birthday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Nathan Lane On Starring In Menendez Brothers TV Adaptation | The View" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixnGbllyVAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As Nathan got on stage, he turned to Joy, and he shared a birthday message. &#8220;By the way, you do not look whatever age you&#8217;re admitting to. You have looked the same since 1998. You&#8217;re the Paul Rudd of daytime television,&#8221; he quipped.</p>



<p>Of course, Nathan wouldn&#8217;t show up on his friend&#8217;s birthday empty-handed! &#8220;Because Joy is still a hot Italian woman, I have ordered Joy a hot Italian pizza,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Then, a good-looking pizza delivery man arrived on set. As he crossed the stage, he tossed the box and pulled off his shirt. He then proceeded to show off his sexy dance moves on the show.</p>

<p>For another segment, Joy also had a tag sale for charity. She and her <em>View </em>co-hosts sold off a few collectible pieces of memorabilia to benefit The Retreat, an organization that helps domestic abuse victims.</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnkjTiVZltw&amp;t=8s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clip</a> was posted on YouTube, a couple of viewers chimed in to suggest that Joy should call it quits. &#8220;Happy Birthday Joy. You are getting OLD. [time] to retired [sic] dear,&#8221; one fan wrote. &#8220;Joy it’s time to retire,&#8221; another person commented.</p>



<p>Despite the suggestions, Joy still clearly has the energy to keep on filming <em>The View</em>. She regularly cracks jokes and weighs in on hot topics for the daily show. Even at 82, she seems just as ready to show up for work.</p>



<p>While there were a few naysayers, the overwhelming amount of comments were positive. &#8220;I can’t believe Joy is 82. She looks amazing!&#8221; one viewer said. </p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s one of the most youthful acting 82 year olds I&#8217;ve ever seen, not to mention how good she looks too. She has some great genes,&#8221; another fan wrote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-joy-behar-said-about-retiring">What Has Joy Behar Said About Retiring?</h2>



<p>Over the years, Joy has spoken about retirement on <em>The View</em>. In February 2023, she explained that she doesn&#8217;t think she&#8217;ll ever truly retire while <a href="https://x.com/TheView/status/1620820354431127552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussing</a> Tom Brady&#8217;s exit from the NFL.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as retirement for me, because I&#8217;m a creative person. So, I&#8217;ll do something else,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I leave this show, I&#8217;ll do something else.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a more recent appearance on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/joy-behar-gets-candid-about-why-shes-been-open-about-her-age/id1585703147?i=1000654973818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Behind The Table </em>podcast</a>, Joy discussed the possibility of retirement with producer Brian Teta. A fan wrote a message to commend her on continuing to work in her 80s, and the comic explained when she&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s time to retire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well you know you happen to be lucky with me in the fact that I will know when it’s time to go you don’t have to tell me and not because I’m not going to be doddering, old and on my behind but because it will be enough already,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Still, Joy explained that she&#8217;s still happy to be on <em>The View</em>. &#8220;At this point, it’s still interesting to me, the show,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>In February of 2025, Joy took a hiatus from the show, but the reason has nothing to do with her age or health.</p>



<p>As Whoopi explained, Behar has temporarily shifted her focus to another project &#8212; her new off-Broadway show My First Ex-Husband, which opened at Mac-Haydn Theater in New York last week.</p>



<p>So while the haters might not like it, it sounds like Joy won&#8217;t be retiring anytime soon!</p>

<p>Joy Behar getting fired was a &#8220;happy&#8221; event for the <em>The View</em> host. Why?</p>



<p>Despite decades of success, many wonder if and when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-view-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The View</em> will be canceled</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/whoopi-goldberg-leaving-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The View </em>co-hosts leave</a>, cycling in and out. The biggest deals are when they&#8217;re the show&#8217;s primary antagonists or when they&#8217;re staples of the hit daytime talk show series.</p>



<p>With a few interruptions, Joy Behar has been part of the show since its inception. Why was she fired? Why was she &#8220;happy&#8221; to be fired?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joy-behar-has-discussed-being-fired-from-the-view">Joy Behar has discussed being fired from &#8216;The View&#8217;</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s more than just one show. Joy Behar has used <em>The View</em> to touch upon her past firing from <em>Good Morning America</em>.</p>



<p>As it turns out, she has been fired from <em>GMA </em>twice. Speaking to <em>The View</em> guest Kumail Nanjiani in 202, she revealed that she had been &#8220;the worst receptionist&#8221; in the show&#8217;s history. </p>



<p>She also alleged that the show had taken her to Chippendales as a &#8220;goodbye present&#8221; while letting her go. It is possible that she was jokingly exaggerating circumstances.</p>

<p>In 2007, Joy Behar left <em>The View</em> despite having helped launch the hit daytime talk show series. Initially, it appeared to be a voluntary situation.</p>



<p>However, in 2022, she <a href="https://people.com/tv/why-joy-behar-left-the-view-in-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divulged to</a> <em>People </em>that &#8220;somebody wanted me gone&#8221; in 2013. Her exit wasn&#8217;t as cordial as it seemed &#8212; she&#8217;d been fired. The series, it seemed, was trying to shift away from political discussion.</p>



<p>Joy Behar believed that the show had been going down the wrong path. Her 2022 commentary noted: &#8220;That&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve been fired for my politics.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-but-joy-behar-was-happy-to-be-fired">But Joy Behar was &#8216;happy&#8217; to be fired</h2>



<p>Her 2013 firing, which was followed by her return as a guest host and then full reinstatement in 2015, was not as unhappy as it would be for most people.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was glad to be fired,&#8221; she admitted to her co-hosts on The View. </p>



<p>Her reason was simple: she missed her friends, and &#8220;all&#8221; of her friends on the show were gone at that point.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-1024x576.png" alt="Whoopi Goldberg speaks directly on The View." class="wp-image-495566" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0312_whoopigoldberg_01.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On The View, Whoopi Goldberg spoke up to defend Kate Middleton and the royal firm after the Princess of Wales&#8217; infamous 2024 Mother&#8217;s Day photoshop fail.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When Joy said this, Whoopi Goldberg expressed a (perhaps joking) degree of hurt.</p>



<p>Joy quickly explained two key points. The first was that she was referring to producers, hair and makeup, and others behind-the-scenes. </p>



<p>And the second was that, at the time, Whoopi was still new to the show. (Whoopi had been part of the panel for several seasons in 2013, as she&#8217;d started in 2007. But &#8230; okay)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-view-is-an-oft-problematic-touchstone-for-the-culture">&#8216;The View&#8217; is an oft-problematic touchstone for the culture</h2>



<p>No one on <em>The View</em> is completely right about everything. Not even your faves. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/bella-thorne-to-whoopi-goldberg-stop-blaming-girls-for-hacked-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Not even <em>our </em>faves</a>.</p>



<p>And even the worst antagonists that she show has cast, panelists like Meghan McCain and Elizabeth Hasselbeck who&#8217;s <em>real </em>jobs were to make negative headlines and get &#8220;owned&#8221; by other hosts, have been at least <em>a little bit</em> right <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/10/meghan-mccain-i-hate-the-trumps-but-i-love-erika-jayne-for-some/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <em>some </em>topics</a>.</p>



<p>The series showcases real (albeit famous) people and their opinions, right and wrong. And to churn out viral moments, memes, memorable quotes, and <em>cringe </em>content. The daytime talk show ecosystem wouldn&#8217;t be the same without it. Or without Joy Behar.</p>

<p>By now, you likely know the sad and scary story of Damar Hamlin.</p>



<p>A 24-year old safety for the Buffalo Bills, Hamlin collapsed this Monday night after making a tackle against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>



<p>We later learned that Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and that CPR had to be performed immediately on the field in order to save his life.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/damar-hamlin-buffalo-bills-safety-regains-consciousness-immediately-asks-doctors-who-won-the-game/">Hamlin appears to be progressing</a> at the moment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t yet know what caused this extreme medical scare &#8212; but Joy Behar appears sure of who and what to blame for the tragedy.</p>



<p>During Wednesday&#8217;s episode of The View, the 80-year old co-host made her disdain for the violent nature of tackle football very well known while discussing what happened to Hamlin.</p>



<p>Said Behar on air:</p>



<p>&#8220;45% of Americans think that tackle football is appropriate. Heterosexual men voted the most support for kids doing football. And conservatives were more likely to support youth tackle football. Just saying.&#8221;</p>

(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re not really sure here what Behar is just saying.</p>



<p>That football should be outlawed?</p>



<p>Earlier in the conversation, fellow panelist Sunny Hostin shared an anecdote about her son&#8230; who recovered from a hamstring injury playing football.</p>



<p>&#8220;He realized at that point, uh-oh. I could – that could happen to my brain, and so he quit,&#8221; she explained, citing the persistent danger of concussions to those who play football.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Then there was Sara Haines, who said her son also plays football and that he&#8217;s described it as a &#8220;bonding experience,&#8221; adding overall: </p>



<p>&#8220;I grew up, and football was just the norm. My parents went to the games long after we were even in high school because the whole town did. </p>



<p>&#8220;I loved &#8216;Friday Night Lights,&#8217; et cetera, et cetera.</p>



<p>&#8220;What [concussions and this injury] might change is people that have kids coming up because like me, you even wouldn’t have known all the damage that could be done now.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ll leave it up to readers to debate the legitimacy of Behar&#8217;s point above, but will end this post with an even more positive update in regard to Demar Hamlin:</p>



<p>Hamlin&#8217;s breathing tube was removed overnight, according to the physicians at University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</p>



<p>He continues to &#8220;progress remarkably in his recovery.&#8221;</p>



<p>His neurological function remains intact and he even took a moment on Friday to FaceTime with his teammates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>You know what they say about The View, right?</p>
<p>You can leave the daytime talk show behind, but this doesn&#8217;t mean that those who still make a living by talking about current events on that program will leave <em>you</em> alone.</p>
<p>Not very catchy or pithy.</p>
<p>But someone probably said it at least once.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s also a relevant saying at the moment because Meghan McCain &#8212; who <a href="/2021/07/meghan-mccain-see-ya-im-quitting-the-view/">departed The View back in July</a> &#8212; is once again feuding with Joy Behar.</p>
<p>For the most asinine of reasons.</p>
<p>It all started after McCain wrote a seemingly innocuous post on February 14, tagging her husband and writing simply:</p>
<p>&quot;Happy Valentines Day @bdomenech &ndash; I love you and am grateful every day for the life we have together.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In response to McCain&#8217;s message, a Twitter user asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Does every thought and sentiment need to be on Twitter?&quot;</p>
<p>And, in response to <em>that</em> remark, Behar wrote in a since-deleted tweet, <strong><em>Apparently</em></strong>.</p>
<p>What a random thing to get upset about, right? What an odd way to take a jab at a former co-worker/foe, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Imagine spending your Valentines Day trolling your ex colleagues tweet about her husband,&quot; fired back McCain on her social media page, alongside a screengrab of their Twitter exchange.</p>
<p>When Fox News host and weather anchor Janice Dean pointed out that Behar &quot;can&#8217;t quit you&quot;, McCain responded to her Tweet, referring to Behar&#8217;s actions as &quot;pathetic&quot; and adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It creeps me out.&quot;</p>
<p>In a since-deleted tweet off her own, McCain also wrote that walking away from The View &quot;is like having ex&#8217;s who won&#8217;t stop drunk texting you.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain left the show last summer, partly because she returned from maternity leave shortly beforehand &#8212; only for Behar to admit on air that she did NOT miss her conservative co-anchor.</p>
<p>In her memoir, McCain said she &quot;felt like [she&#8217;d] been slapped&quot; at the time, adding that she &quot;burst into tears&quot; and was &quot;uncontroll[ably] sobbing&quot; when they cut to commercial.</p>
<p>&quot;Until that moment it hadn&#8217;t even occurred to me that Joy hadn&#8217;t missed me,&quot; McCain wrote.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>McCain alleges that when she asked for an apology from Behar over this snub, producers told her that no mea culpa was coming.</p>
<p>And this is when she knew what she had to go: quit.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a look at my life outside of myself and I thought clearly &#8212; this s&#8212; isn&#8217;t worth this,&quot; wrote McCain in the aforementioned book, adding elsewhere:</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;s supposed to be my friend and it&#8217;s supposed to be a sisterhood. I&#8217;ll never forget. I went back to my office and I had a panic attack. I was crying. I was hyperventilating. I threw up.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>McCain, meanwhile, also chimed in this month after Whoopi Goldberg claimed that the <a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2022/02/whoopi-goldberg-suspended-from-the-view-for-holocaust-remarks/">Holocast wasn&#8217;t about race</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not calling for Whoopi Goldberg to be fired, if only because I don&#8217;t believe there is any universe where she could possibly do anything that could get her fired &#8212; she is the crown jewel of The View and a pop culture icon,&quot; <a href="/2022/02/meghan-mccain-destroys-whoopi-goldberg-her-half-assed-holocaust/">said McCain amid this controversy</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;But I hope this can be used as a teachable moment to explain to millions of Americans why conflating the Holocaust as something that is specific and limited to &#8216;white people&#8217; is insane, ahistorical and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>&quot;For as much as the left is fond of using Nazi comparisons and imagery, the truth of the Holocaust, who it targeted and why, deserves to be known and understood by all.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldberd got suspended for two weeks by ABC for her comment and returned to work on Monday.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, Behar and her co-panelists talked openly about a photo that has surfaced on social media, even including footage of the photo itself on air.</p>
<p>It depicts Behar at a Halloween party in 2016, her face darkened in a controversial manner known as &quot;Blackface.&quot;</p>
<p>This name was coined back in the 19th century after white performers used theatrical make-up to represent caricature of black people.</p>
<p>Ever since, it&#8217;s been considered very insensitive and offensive for a non-black person to dress up or pretend to be a black person because it dredges up memories of slavery and civil rights violations.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230; <a href="/2018/04/luann-de-lesseps-defends-herself-against-blackface-backlash/">celebrities continue to get in trouble for the act</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went as a beautiful African woman,&rdquo; Behar said as an explanation for this look, which we&#8217;ve included below:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="499" height="513" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/joy-behar-in-blackface.jpg" alt="Joy Behar in Blackface" class="wp-image-321167" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/joy-behar-in-blackface.jpg 499w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/joy-behar-in-blackface-292x300.jpg 292w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/joy-behar-in-blackface-326x335.jpg 326w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/joy-behar-in-blackface-338x347.jpg 338w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;I had makeup that was a little bit darker than my skin &ndash; that&rsquo;s my actual hair, though,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Raven-Symon&eacute; seemed concerned upon seeing the picture, putting her co-host on the spot by asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joy, are you black? Are you my auntie, Joy? Do you have tanning lotion on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while Behar seemed to brush off the incident as no big deal, essentially brushing it off as a normal Halloween costume, viewers and Twitter users are taking the comedian to task.</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Megyn Kelly was fired from her show for asking a hypothetical question about blackface. Joy Behar actually wore blackface, and admitted it, and showed a picture of it on TV, yet she still has her job,&rdquo; wrote one astute individual.</p>
<p>This is a reference to how Kelly got canned by NBC after she <a href="/2018/10/megyn-kelly-fired-from-nbc-following-blackface-comments/">questioned why blackface was a big deal</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a reminder that Megyn Kelly was fired for saying that blackface was acceptable when she was a kid (and not actually *participating* in blackface like all of these people.)&rdquo; another person noted.</p>
<p>Said Kelly during one of her final Today Show segments:</p>
<p>&rdquo;What is racist? Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween.</p>
<p>&quot;Back when I was a kid that was OK, as long as you were dressing like a character.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kelly eventually made a public mea cupla &#8211; but then-colleague Al Roker said &ldquo;she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country,&quot; adding:</p>
<p>&quot;This is a history going back to the 1830s &mdash; minstrel shows, to demean and denigrate a race wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m old enough to have lived through Amos &rsquo;n&rsquo; Andy, where you had white people in blackface playing two black characters and just magnifying the worst stereotypes about black people.</p>
<p>&quot;And that&rsquo;s what the big problem is.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>DO YOU THINK JOY BEHAR SHOULD BE FIRED FOR HER OUTFIT?</strong></p>

<p>According to a new report, it is totally on between the longest tenured members of The View.</p>
<p>In one corner is not especially funny comedian Joy Behar; in the other corner is lead panelist Whoopi Goldberg.</p>
<p>Will this alleged feud lead to yet another cast shakeup for the morning talk show?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-683x1024.jpg" alt="Joy Behar Image" class="wp-image-243505" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/joy-behar-image-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those who tune in to see Behar, Goldberg and company chat about Hot Topics on a daily basis are aware that Joy and Whoopi get along when the cameras are rolling.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not any noticeable tension between the stars.</p>
<p>Backstage, however, &#8220;it’s a different matter,&#8221; an insider tells Radar Online, <a href="http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/the-view-whoopi-goldberg-joy-behar-fighting-claims-show-hosts-mortal-enemies/">adding of Behar and Goldberg</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;They’re mortal enemies &#8211; and Joy wants to be the queen bee!&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure anyone actually talks that way, so we&#8217;re not sure if we really believe this claim.</p>
<p>But it makes for a fun rumor, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p><a href="/2016/07/whoopi-goldberg-signs-new-deal-on-the-view/">Goldberg signed a one-year deal</a> to stick around The View in July.</p>
<p>It was the rare occurrence of a cast member actually NOT being let go, as the program has become more well known at this point for its rotating cast of stars than anything the women actually discuss.</p>
<p>However, the 60-year old actress has allegedly told friends that she’s fed up with the show and that she remains angry over Behar leading in 2013&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; only to return a few months later.</p>
<p>“Whoopi made it clear she wasn’t happy about Joy’s ‘grandstanding’ when she made a big deal about leaving,” the source tells Radar.</p>

<p>“Especially when Joy started guest-hosting almost right away … before returning for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, there had been talk that Goldberg wasn’t happy with Rosie O’Donnell during her two stints as a View panelist.</p>
<p>Goldberg allegedly blamed Rosie back then for the show&#8217;s declining ratings.</p>
<p>Behar, meanwhile, is now the only original host left on The View. She just signed a three-year deal worth a reported $2.5 million.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="406" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/the-view-panel.jpg" alt="The View Panel" class="wp-image-243507" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/the-view-panel.jpg 634w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/the-view-panel-300x192.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/the-view-panel-335x215.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/the-view-panel-347x222.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/the-view-panel-520x333.jpg 520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /><figcaption>(© ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The two are joined on the series these days by Paula Faris, Candace Cameron Bure, Sara Haines, Raven-Symone, Jedediah Bila and Sunny Hostin.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve grown pretty sick of The View over the years, along with this sort of backstage drama.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ve also had some ideas of just who fit re-energize the program.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown of potential View panelists who we&#8217;d love to see join the cast:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The reality star will join the Broadway cast of <em>Chicago</em> as Mama Morton, and yesterday made an appearance on <em>The View </em>as part of her press tour.</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t go as swimmingly as one may have hoped, though.</p>
<p>&quot;Just sat down with <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nene-leakes-slams-women-of-the-view-calls-them-bunch-of-mean-girls-w157792">a bunch of mean girls</a> turning up their noses, looking u up &amp; down as if u don&rsquo;t belong,&rdquo; Leakes tweeted (then later deleted before <em>Us Magazine</em> grabbed the quote).</p>
<p>The Tweets and Instagrams&nbsp;that followed were positive, showing no trace of animosity that was clearly visible during her segment.</p>
<p>Things started off fine as Leakes hugged each of the ladies, playfully hitting <strong>Joy Behar </strong>as she took her seat at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop it!&quot;&nbsp;Behar joked (I think). &nbsp;&quot;If I got a black a blue mark, I&#8217;m gonna sue your ass!&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That right there set the tone of the appearance.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;Leakes talked about leaving <em>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</em>, ​as well as&nbsp;her new six-bedroom home, Behar sat there with a look on her face that said, &quot;I&#8217;m over this.&quot;</p>

<p>The other women, including <strong>Candace Cameron-Bure</strong>, did their best to keep the interview moving, but the tension between Leakes and Behar was palpable.</p>
<p>When Leakes showed photos her Atlanta home, the ladies wanted to know where the eff all the furniture was.</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#8217;s the furniture, Nene!&quot; <strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> asked</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#8217;t want to show you guys pictures of my furniture,&quot; Leakes&nbsp;said, citing security reasons.</p>
<p>Behar&nbsp;pressed on about why showing furniture would pose a security risk, then gave up because it was a losing battle.</p>
<p>Watch the clip below to soak up the tension.</p>

Look who is set to enjoy The View once again!</p>
<p>ABC has confirmed the full panel for Season 19 of this ever-changing talk show, with Joy Behar officially on board to return as a full-time host.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The comedian will be joined at the table by returning stars Whoopi Goldberg, Michelle Collins and Raven-Symon&eacute;.</p>
<p>Newcomers, meanwhile, will iclude Paula Faris of ABC News and Full House actress Candace Cameron Bure, who <a href="/videos/candace-cameron-bure-and-raven-symone-clash-over-lesbian-wedding/">famously clashed with&nbsp;Raven-Symon&eacute;</a>&nbsp;over gay wedding cakes earlier this summer.</p>
<p>&quot;As The View embarks on a remarkable 19th season, I am extremely proud to see the legacy of smart and diverse women engaging in entertaining and thought-provoking conversation continue,&quot; Barbara Walters, creator and executive producer, said via statement.</p>
<p>The program, of course, has undergone countless cast evolutions over recent years.</p>
<p>Rosie O&#8217;Donnell was around for a year. Then, she left. Then, she returned. Then, she left again.</p>
<p>Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy were shown the door last year and then Rosie Perez lasted for just a few months as a regular.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned full-time hosts, The View will feature a rotating team of contributors that includes Shepherd, Top Chef&#8217;s Padma Lakshmi, What Not to Wear veteran Stacy London, Ana Navarro and actress-model Molly Sims.</p>
<p>They all sound well and good&#8230; but here&#8217;s a look at who we&#8217;d have chosen to appear everyday on The View:</p>

<p>Just one day after word got out that <a href="/2014/07/rosie-odonnell-to-run-it-back-on-the-view/">Rosie O&#8217;Donnell would return to The View</a> as a co-host of the popular chat show, Elisabeth Hasselbeck responded as only she can.</p>
<p><a href="/2014/07/elisabeth-hasselbeck-blasts-rosie-odonnell-on-fox-news/">Hasselbeck blasted O&#8217;Donnell</a> on Fox News, accusing the comedienne of equating US troops with terrorists. (Hasselbeck apparently didn&#8217;t get the memo that Rosie&#8217;s son attends military school):</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/elisabeth-hasselbeck-talks-rosie-odonnell"></a></figure>
<p>Former View co-host <a href="/2014/07/joy-behar-to-elisabeth-hasselbeck-explain-yourself/">Joy Behar demanded an explanation from Hasselbeck</a> and today she got one. Kind of&#8230;</p>
<p>Behar took to Instagram to elaborate on her &quot;analysis&quot; of the O&#8217;Donnell situation and explain why she&#8217;ll never retract her statements:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>&quot;When asked about Roise&nbsp;combing [sic] back, I provided my analysis,&quot; wrote Hasselbeck. &quot;When the two chairs get filled &#8211; if asked &#8211; I will provide my analysis.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasselbeck then posted a transcript of a debate between herself and O&#8217;Donnell that aired on The View in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t hate Rosie,&quot; Hasselbeck continued. &quot;I actually called to have a conversation with her seven years ago. She did not want to speak to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to have a #momversation about why I would never defend her 2007 comments.&quot;</p>
<p>Momversation? Wow. We hate to take sides here, but we really can&#8217;t get on board with Elisabeth&#8217;s use of terrible puns.</p>
