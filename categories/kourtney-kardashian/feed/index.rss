<p>Kourtney Kardashian knows what people out there are saying, thinking and writing on social media.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s heard the rumor for awhile now.</p>



<p>But is she mad? Is she upset? Is she full of rage that some folks out there really think <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> is the father of her 10-year old son, Reign?</p>



<p>LOL, you guys. No!</p>

<p>“Kourtney doesn’t give any heed to the reports that Justin is Reign’s father,” <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/how-kourtney-kardashian-feels-about-rumors-justin-bieber-is-reigns-dad/">a source told</a> Us Weekly on April 1, adding of the reality star&#8217;s reaction: </p>



<p>“She thinks it’s ridiculous and laughs that people online would even believe that.”</p>



<p>Indeed, this seemingly insane line of thinking has gone viral enough that young Reign himself actually responded to it this week.</p>



<p>The 10-year old hoped to shut down the conspiracy theory via an Instagram Live shared by his stepsister Alabama Barker’s boyfriend, Scooter Jackson.</p>

<p>“No, he’s not. Bro, I swear, Justin Bieber is not my dad,” Reign told viewers in a clip from the stream shared on TikTok yesterday. “Scotty … Scotty … Scotty is my dad.”</p>



<p>This really is the truth.</p>



<p>Reign is the youngest of Kardashian’s three children with ex Scott Disick&#8230; including son Mason, 15, and daughter Penelope, 12. The couple famously dated on and off for nine years before ending their relationship for good in July 2015.</p>



<p>Having been around for a decade, Reign even did the math for those who believe this rumor about Bieber.</p>



<p>“I don’t know how old my mom was, but I think Justin Bieber was 16 when I got born. I don’t think my mom would do that,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Kourtney was 35 when this son was born, meaning she would have been impregnated at the time by a minor and would have actually broken the law.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1024x576.png" alt="Kourtney Kardashian loses a few buttons on Season 5, Episode 9 of The Kardashians." class="wp-image-504253" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0718_thekardashians_05_kourtneykardashian.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Explaining her nanny and how she&#8217;s spending limited time away from her baby, Kourtney Kardashian chats on The Kardashians Season 5, Episode 9.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Hulu)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>There <em>was</em> chatter awhile back that Kardashian and Bieber were kinda sorta dating.</p>



<p>Bieber was around 21 years old when he was linked to Kardashian following her split from Disick. </p>



<p>“Justin started hanging out with Kourtney alone because she started going out more,” an insider told Us way back in December 2015. “She never really went out before, so he’s been showing her a good time.&#8221;</p>



<p>This same tabloid quoted an anonymous source that alleged Bieber had &#8220;bragged to friends recently that he has been hooking up with Kourtney Kardashian.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still. This fling would have taken place years after Reign was born.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="689" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-689x1024.jpg" alt="Kourtney Kardashian attends the TAO Chicago Grand Opening Celebration at TAO Chicago on September 15, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois." class="wp-image-504200" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-689x1024.jpg 689w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-202x300.jpg 202w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-768x1141.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-1379x2048.jpg 1379w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-646x960.jpg 646w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-727x1080.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-808x1200.jpg 808w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1034004232-scaled.jpg 1724w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kourtney Kardashian attends the TAO Chicago Grand Opening Celebration at TAO Chicago on September 15, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Schear/Getty Images for TAO Chicago)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Oddly, this is the second quasi paternity scandal that Kardashian has faced over the last several weeks.</p>



<p>She previously slammed talk that her son <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kourtney-kardashian-denies-15-year-old-son-has-a-love-child/">Mason has a child of his own</a>.</p>



<p>“I rarely address rumors or conspiracies regarding myself or my family, but this is about my child and it feels wrong to let anyone think for a second that these lies are remotely true,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on March 2. “They are not true. Mason does not have a child.”</p>



<p>She added back then:</p>



<p>&#8220;He is a kid with feelings and a beautiful life ahead of him. Please stop spreading false narratives and spinning lives. And to all the other people making videos about my kids (who, by the way, are minors), please stop and leave them alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reign Disick is only 10 years old, but he&#8217;s already joined in on the proud family tradition of publicly denying insane rumors.</p>



<p>You see, Reign is the son of Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick, but some fans are convinced that he&#8217;s not really Scott&#8217;s.</p>



<p>And just like the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/khloe-kardashian-real-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Khloe Kardashian-O.J. Simpson conspiracy theorists</a>, they&#8217;re convinced that they know exactly who the real father is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reign-addresses-the-bieber-rumors">Reign addresses the Bieber rumors</h2>



<p>The rumors of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/08/kourtney-kardashian-i-should-be-engaged-to-justin-bieber-not-hai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tryst between Kourtney and Justin</a> have been around for years. But this is the first time that a member of the family addressed those claims directly.</p>



<p>And Reign did not mince words. The elementary schooler hopped on Instagram Live this week (probably not a great idea for a 10-year-old), and he seemed shocked when a commenter asked him about the Bieber claims.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s not. Bro, I swear, Justin Bieber is not my dad. Scotty…Scotty…Scotty is my dad,&#8221; Reign replied, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/31/reign-disick-scott-justin-bieber-father-rumor-kourtney-kardashian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how old my mom was, but I think Justin Bieber was 16 when I got born. I don&#8217;t think my mom would do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Biebs was actually 19 when Reign was born.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s still no convincing evidence that JB is his dad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-legend-of-justin-and-kourtney-lives-on">The legend of Justin and Kourtney lives on</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that the rumors about Justin and Kourtney have persisted for over a decade. And they&#8217;ve been detailed by some pretty reputable outlets.</p>

<p>“They have hooked up a few times, including recently. It happens in L.A. He has met her kids, but they don’t hook up around the kids. It’s on nights when she has help and is able to go out,&#8221; an insider once told <em><a href="https://people.com/reign-disick-addresses-rumors-that-justin-bieber-is-his-dad-11706216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em> magazine.</p>



<p>“Kourtney is great. Justin thinks it’s cool that she is older and hot. She isn’t clingy and has her own life,” the source continued. </p>



<p>“There are no bad consequences for Justin to hook up with her. She is very easygoing and just makes it fun for him to be around her.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-possible-that-justin-is-the-father">Is it possible that Justin is the father?</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="664" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-1024x664.jpg" alt="Justin Bieber in April of 2022, wearing a pink beanie." class="wp-image-520139" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-1024x664.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-300x194.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-768x498.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-2048x1328.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-960x622.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-1080x700.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0226_justinbieber_03-1200x778.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Bieber arrives for the 64th Annual Grammy Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite all of that, there&#8217;s no real reason for Justin to submit to a paternity test.</p>



<p>As many have pointed out, Reign bears a striking resemblance to Scott.</p>



<p>And even more importantly, father and son both share the same snarky sense of humor.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starting to get a lot of vibes, like his dad,&#8221; Kourtney joked on a recent episode of<em> The Kardashians</em>. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s starting to get that sense of humor. I&#8217;m like, just what we need.&#8221;</p>



<p>Justin, as we know, is a bit more serious &#8212;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/hailey-unfollows-justin-bieber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> especially these days</a>.</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian currently finds herself fighting off divorce rumors &#8212; again.</p>



<p>Is her marriage with Travis Barker really in trouble? If it is, the pair have a funny way of showing that they&#8217;re anything less than madly in love with each other. </p>



<p>But to say that a divorce couldn&#8217;t happen is premature also. After all, show us a happily married Hollywood couple and we&#8217;ll show you 50 more that didn&#8217;t make it. </p>



<p>So what is the latest with Kourtney and Travis? Let&#8217;s dive in. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-s-not-getting-a-divorce">Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s Not Getting A Divorce</h2>



<p>Kravis fans can take a deep breath. So far as we know, the love between Kourtney and Travis is stronger than ever, even when they&#8217;re worlds apart.</p>



<p>The trouble all started as fans became concerned by the fact that Kourtney hasn&#8217;t posted any new photos with Travis for a bit on her social media. Since these two live for a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-emmys-pda-kissing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDA</a> shot, it did strike us as odd as well. </p>



<p>That is, until you take into account that Travis is in the middle of a world tour with Blink-182. To quote Luke Hobbs, &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s gotta go to work!&#8221;</p>



<p>Fears should be quelled though. Travis was back stateside for the summer dates of the tour, and by all accounts, he was on hand for her birthday on April 18 of last year. Plus, would someone who didn&#8217;t want to stay married write this to his wife?</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever,&#8221; Travis posted on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C56sMi5PJYf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.  &#8220;I love you, I love our life together. Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for. Here’s to many more years of adventures together&#8221;</p>



<p>Um, sounds pretty happy to us! Oh, and if you needed further proof, behold her response: </p>



<p>&#8220;Husband of my dreams. I love our life!!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-kourtney-and-travis-divorce-rumors-start">How Did Kourtney and Travis Divorce Rumors Start?</h2>



<p>So why all the commotion about Kourtney getting a divorce if everything she says and does screams to the contrary? Two words for you: Scott Disick.</p>



<p>Of the many Kravis fans that are out there, a handful still hold dear to the love Kourtney had before. Scott Disick was Kourtney&#8217;s on-and-off again boyfriend for nearly a decade. The pair share three children together, yet despite all that time, they never actually got married.</p>



<p>During the 2021&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kourtney-kardashian-earring-quote-kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-callback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KUWTK</a></em>&nbsp;reunion special, Kourtney admitted to&nbsp;Andy Cohen&nbsp;that Scott’s drug abuse was the “deal breaker” that kept them from taking the next step.&nbsp;He also had a history of cheating on Kourtney multiple times.</p>



<p>So why so much love for Scott? Well, aside from being the father of Mason, Penelope, and Reign, he also has strong relationships with Kourtney&#8217;s sisters. In a way, many view him to be the second brother the girls never had. (LOVE YOU, ROB!)</p>

<p>Scott aside, sometimes fans like to throw out the &#8220;D&#8221; word when it comes to these two just because, well, they find the pair a bit odd. </p>



<p>Take the arrival of their son, Rocky. The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/kourtney-kardashian-excluded-family-so-they-wouldnt-make-pregnancy-reveal-all-about-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">little one</a> was born at the end of 2023, and while it took a while for the parents to share the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-present-first-baby-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first picture</a>, they did share details about the birth.</p>



<p>Travis was slammed online after sharing a video of him practicing the drums while his wife Kourtney was in labor. The Blink-182 drummer said that he was &#8220;practicing to his baby&#8217;s heartbeat.&#8221; You may find that precious, but others called the move &#8220;obnoxious&#8221;</p>



<p>One fan actually <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/travis-barkers-behaviour-during-kourtney-31412179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>: &#8220;Travis was doing this to the baby’s heartbeat so that’s sweet but still…. DIVORCE!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>A little over the top, but it&#8217;s stuff like this that fuels the flame.</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian is defending Mason Disick against an outrageous rumor.</p>



<p>Mason only <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/scott-disick-mason-car/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned 15 years old</a> in December. </p>



<p>Yet a hurtful, outlandish rumor has alleged that he has a &#8220;secret baby.&#8221; </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kourtney-kardashian-denies-15-year-old-son-has-a-love-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney speaks out</a> to defend her eldest, Mason is returning to social media.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mason-disick-is-back-on-public-social-media">Mason Disick is back on (public) social media!</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Mason Disick took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/masondisick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story, marking his social media return.</p>



<p>The post itself was casual, showing him on a night out with friends.</p>



<p>Mason often keeps himself partially obscured in photos. It is normal for teens to feel self-conscious, but it is possible that he is also hoping to be able to go a few places without being recognized. For the son of Kourtney Kardashian, that is a challenge.</p>

<p>Mason Disick does not currently live with mom Kourtney Kardashian. He is instead living with his dad, Scott.</p>



<p>However, he&#8217;s still clearly living the life of a teen son of famously affluent parents. He and his friends were wearing high-end clothes appropriate for Gen Z.</p>



<p id="eP54IbXsGg">Mason&#8217;s post did not reference the ugly rumor targeting him. But his mother, however, did make a post to nip that claim in the bud.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-wants-to-quash-this-ugly-rumor">Kourtney Kardashian wants to quash this ugly rumor</h2>



<p>On March 2, Kourtney Kardashian took to her Instagram Story to quash the rumor that Mason Disick secretly became a father in 2024.</p>



<p>The unsubstantiated claim alleges that Mason fathered a child named Piper, who was born in 2024. This claim comes from a hoax account that pretended to be Mason. If it&#8217;s true, there&#8217;s certainly no proof.</p>



<p>And Kourtney said all of that and more in her post. </p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian has taken the unusual step of talking about one of her kids in public.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because the Internet has taken the not-so-unusual step of circulating a sort of insane rumor &#8212; this one applying directly to one of the reality star&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, some folks on social media have been claiming that Kourtney&#8217;s 15-year-old son Mason Disick &#8212; whose dad is Scott Disick &#8212; had recently welcomed a child of his own, prompting the following response from an offended and irritated Kardashian.</p>



<p>&#8220;I rarely address rumors or conspiracies regarding myself or my family, but this is about my child and it feels wrong to let anyone think for a second that these lies are remotely true,&#8221; the Hulu personality wrote in a March 2 Instagram Story post. </p>



<p>&#8220;They are not. Mason does not have a child. These accounts that pretend to be him are definitely not. They are FAKE.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Kourtney notes here, there&#8217;s always a lot of chatter out there about her or her siblings&#8230; such as the idea that husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/travis-barker-accused-of-controlling-kourtney-kardashian-after-they-welcome-their-first-child/">Travis Barker is in control of their marriage</a>.</p>

<p>But this is her son here, you guys. The star has no real choice but to speak out.</p>



<p>&#8220;My son really values his privacy, and I am asking all media to please be respectful: he is a kid with feelings and a beautiful life ahead of him,&#8221; Kardashian added. </p>

<p>The 45-year-old also shares Penelope Disick, 12, and Reign Disick, 10, with Scott, as well as 15-month-old son Rocky Barker with husband Travis Barker.</p>



<p>For the most part, Mason has pulled back from the public in recent years &#8212; for example, he is no longer appears on The Kardashians.</p>



<p>But the teenager <em>has</em> started to appear in family photos again and recently went public with his own Instagram account.</p>



<p>In May of last year, Mason launched this page and uploaded rare photos of himself looking quite grown up on the social media platform.</p>

<p>The 15-year received stunned and emotional reactions from his aunts Khloé Kardashian and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> in the comments section as they responded to the aforementioned pictures.</p>



<p>“I can’t believe this is happening,” Khloé, while Kim chimed in as follows in reference to her nephew: “You’re really on Instagram.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mason is most definitely growing up.</p>



<p>“He’s starting to really like girls, and obviously girls like him,” Scott told Khloe on the January 8 episode of her Khloe in Wonder Land podcast. </p>



<p>“I just said, ‘You can do whatever you want, just don’t lie and don’t manipulate any girls. So if a girl tells you she wants to maybe do something with you and, like, hook up or whatever, if she knows that you’re not in a relationship with her, don’t tell her you are just to get something out of her.’”</p>

<p>Well, sort of.</p>



<p>On <em>The Kardashians</em>, their precious son made his reality TV debut.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kourtney-kardashian-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourt and Travis</a> were careful to make sure that no one sees him too clearly just yet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rocky-thirteen-barker-makes-his-the-kardashians-debut">Rocky Thirteen Barker makes his &#8216;The Kardashians&#8217; Debut!</h2>



<p>On the Thursday, February 13 episode of <em>The Kardashians</em>, baby Rocky Barker made his reality TV debut.</p>



<p>Rocky&#8217;s middle name may be Thirteen, but he was not yet 13 months when this filmed. (Kourtney and Travis welcomed their son on November 1, 2023, making him 15 months and some change at present)</p>



<p>Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have prioritized Sunday dinners. This time, however, instead of having a chef make food for the family at home, they went for a ride in Travis&#8217; new, old car. (It is a Chevy Impala from before anyone in the family save Kris was born)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-1024x576.png" alt="Travis Barker's Chevy Impala stops in the emergency lane amidst LA traffic." class="wp-image-519256" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-728x410.png 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03-1200x675.png 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0214_thekardashians_03.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Disaster!

<p>Kourtney planned a surprise. Instead of their usual dinner, they would have family dinner at the Peterson Automotive Museum. (If you&#8217;ve never been, it&#8217;s genuinely interesting &#8212; even if you don&#8217;t care about cars. Travis, however, does care about cars)</p>



<p>Travis cares so much about cars that he has a Chevy logo tattooed on his body. He drove his newly fixed up Chevy Impala with Kourtney, Penelope, Reign, and Rocky. Landon Barker followed behind them.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, disaster struck &#8212; in the form of a flat tire. Travis has been through worse vehicular situations. He pulled over into the emergency lane and they transferred into a new vehicle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-gave-rocky-a-tour-of-the-museum">Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker gave Rocky a tour of the museum</h2>



<p>Alongside Reign and Penelope and Landon (remember, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kourtney-kardashians-son-moves-out-leaves-star-devastated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mason lives with his dad</a>), Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian were sure to let little Rocky take in the sights.</p>



<p>However, editing continued to blur his precious little face.</p>



<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t call Kourtney and Travis&#8217; baby &#8220;anonymous&#8221; by any means, this is at least a gesture of protecting his privacy. And helping his parents to avoid a specific flavor of <em>deeply weird comments</em>.</p>

<p>“Oh, I love you, my boy,” Travis gushed over his little son.</p>



<p>At another point, he raved: “Wow, Rock! Look at this! We’re in heaven.”</p>



<p>While a literal baby is less likely to appreciate a classic car in the way that an adult collector might, a baby can still love the experience. Seeing different sizes, shapes, and colors of cars can be stimulating for developing minds. And it is not uncommon for toddlers and preschoolers to develop fascinations with vehicles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyone-loves-the-baby-boy">Everyone loves the baby boy</h2>



<p>When Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker sat down for the actual family dinner, they continued to lavish Rocky with love and affection.</p>



<p>At one point, Kourt bounced him on her lap and marveled at &#8220;[How] delicious you are!&#8221;</p>



<p>Later, Travis fed Kourtney while she breastfed Rocky. One day, <em>The Kardashians</em> viewers might see more of him. But for now, it is a very tasteful choice to keep his exposure to a minimum.</p>

<p>Fans aren&#8217;t loving this year&#8217;s Kourtney Kardashian Christmas decorations.</p>



<p>Whether she&#8217;s just really in the holiday spirit or trying to fill <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kourtney-kardashians-son-moves-out-leaves-star-devastated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a void in her home</a>, this year&#8217;s display is ostentatious.</p>



<p>Sometimes, that really works for the Kardashian brand.</p>



<p>But Kourt&#8217;s followers aren&#8217;t just recoiling at some gauche Christmas decor. They&#8217;re accusing her of being downright tone deaf.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-shared-this-year-s-christmas-decorations">Kourtney Kardashian shared this year&#8217;s Christmas decorations</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, Kourtney Kardashian bombarded <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDDb5E0y8JY/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> followers with an array of photos showcasing her holiday decor.</p>



<p>Kourtney is a Christian, and she and her house are definitely celebrating the season.</p>



<p>But as you can see, Kourt went above and beyond. She all but turned her home into an ostentatious Hallmark film.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Kourtney&#8217;s posts show off an enormous tree in her foyer. It is not <em>so </em>uncommon for families to showcase one tree for &#8220;show&#8221; for guests or drivers on the street, and another for the family.</p>



<p>In Kourt&#8217;s case, however, she has a wall of six trees along one wall of her spacious living room. (There&#8217;s also an upside-down tree?)</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s her yard. She has an array of decorated trees in her yard &#8212; beyond merely stringing lights upon the trees that she already has.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because one Christmas tree isn’t enough?&#8221; one Instagram commenter asked rhetorically.</p>



<p>&#8220;You <em>so </em>know some people can&#8217;t even afford one,&#8221; a second user commented.</p>



<p>Another stated: &#8220;Having 47 Christmas trees in your house is a weird flex. Very strange reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>“It’s difficult looking at your lavish decor when my family and many others I know struggle to buy groceries for their family,” another commenter expressed.</p>



<p>“You gotta be sh&#8211;ting me,&#8221; declared another social media denizen. &#8220;People living in tents in downtown cities and you have 52 Christmas trees. We live in a totally f@ck3d up society.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-others-defended-the-decor">Others defended the decor</h2>



<p>“A lot of haters here,&#8221; accused one defender. &#8220;This woman can decorate her home any was she wishes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another announced: “To all the haters commenting on here nasty things. I know if I was able to afford this, I’d make my house a magical winter wonderland for my kids, too.”</p>



<p>Some merely questioned Kourt&#8217;s taste in decor. Others are taking issue with her flaunting her colossal wealth when millions struggle under extreme economic inequality. </p>



<p>Only Kourtney can decide how to decorate her home, but is this really the Christmas vibe that she wants to give off?</p>

<p>Actor Sylvester Stallone whipped up a one-of-a-kind gift for Kourtney&#8217;s son, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kourtney-kardashian-delves-into-terrifying-emergency-surgery-for-baby-son/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocky Thirteen Barker</a>.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t a new, better name. But it was, as you might guess, related.</p>



<p>Momager <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kris-jenner-wedding-plans-the-kardashians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kris Jenner</a> arranged the unique gift for Rocky&#8217;s first birthday.</p>



<p>Kourtney&#8217;s son will definitely have bragging rights. When he&#8217;s old enough to know who Sylvester Stallone is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kourtney-kardashian-s-son-rocky-celebrated-his-first-birthday">Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s son Rocky celebrated his first birthday</h2>



<p>Rocky Thirteen Barker was born on November 1, 2023. Travis Barker gave that name to him. And <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/travis-barker-accused-of-controlling-kourtney-kardashian-after-they-welcome-their-first-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kourtney Kardashian allowed that</a>.</p>



<p>Friday, November 1 of this year was Rocky&#8217;s first birthday. Kris Jenner, his adoring grandmother, shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/krisjenner/p/DB1veGlR4Zg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post to honor her grandson.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy birthday to our precious Rocky!!&#8221; Kris captioned the post. I can’t believe you are already a year old! It feels like just yesterday that we were welcoming you to the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are grandchild number 13,&#8221; Kris Jenner noted. &#8220;And the most precious little smiley boy I have ever met!!&#8221;</p>



<p>She expressed: &#8220;I can’t wait to watch you grow up and I am so thankful to God that He chose me to be your grandma.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0">Kris then reiterated: &#8220;I love you so so much and I can’t wait to watch you grow.&#8221; That much is classic for a grandmother&#8217;s birthday message. However, the next part is <em>very </em>Kardashian.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sylvester-stallone-penned-a-special-gift-for-kourtney-s-son">Sylvester Stallone penned a special gift for Kourtney&#8217;s son </h2>



<p>Kris Jenner got the OG Rocky (Sylvester Stallone, from the boxing movies; not to be confused with <em>Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>) to provide a one-of-a-kind gift for grandbaby Rocky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dear Rocky, My name is Rocky too,&#8221; the handwritten message reads. &#8220;Your name is very special and is identified with wonderful things.&#8221;</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">Stallone advised: &#8220;Life has many challenges you will face — you will need to show dedication and determination! You must never give up on your dreams. Never!&#8221;</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0">&#8220;Now most importantly,&#8221; Sylvester Stallone continued in his note to Kourtney&#8217;s son Rocky, &#8220;you must always value family, friendship, and loyalty over fame and fortune!&#8221;</p>



<p>The Kardashians are all about loyalty. Of course, they&#8217;ve also turned that into part of the key of their fame and fortune.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">Sylvester Stallone concluded his note: &#8220;Keep punching, Sly &#8216;Rocky&#8217; Stallone.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-he-appreciate-the-present">Will he appreciate the present?</h2>



<p>Right now, Rocky Thirteen Barker is one year old. So Travis and Kourtney&#8217;s son likely isn&#8217;t up for reading, let alone for appreciating the gift.</p>



<p>Even when he&#8217;s old enough to fully grasp who Sylvester Stallone is and see the Rocky films &#8230; it may feel odd. One has to imagine a Millennial like Rocky&#8217;s aunt Khloe if she had a signed Errol Flynn note. Yes, it would be neat and a part of history and she would know who Errol Flynn is. But would it be a prized possession?</p>



<p>Also, Rocky is a unique name. So unique that, as anyone with a distinct or uncommon name might warn, any comparisons can wear thin over the years. Though, with luck, Rocky Thirteen&#8217;s classmates will have no idea about the old timey boxing movies, either.</p>

<p>Scott Disick is facing off with Kourtney and Travis in a potential &#8220;showdown,&#8221; a  new report explains.</p>



<p>This summer, we reported on how Kourtney Kardashian&#8217;s eldest son is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kourtney-kardashians-son-moves-out-leaves-star-devastated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with Scott Disick</a>.</p>



<p>Some aspects of her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/kourtney-kardashian-sons-against-travis-barker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marriage to Travis Barker</a> seem to be rubbing some of the family the wrong way.</p>



<p>And it sounds like Scott is no exception. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scott-disick-is-reportedly-butting-heads-with-kourtney-and-travis">Scott Disick is reportedly butting heads with Kourtney and Travis</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/scott-disick-would-love-a-big-showdown-with-kourtney-and-travis-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by <em>In Touch Weekly</em>, Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have been in conflict for months.</p>



<p>When Mason Disick, who turns 15 next month, moved out of Kourtney and Travis&#8217; love nest and moved in with Scott, it seemed to make things worse. That&#8217;s not Mason&#8217;s fault, of course. His moving out was, if anything, a symptom.</p>



<p>Now, a number of holidays are approaching. The Kardashians will be having big family gatherings. And that means that tensions are on the rise &#8230; and could escalate further.</p>

<p>According to a similar <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kourtney-kardashian-disturbed-by-scott-disicks-misogyny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> from <em>Life &amp; Style</em>, Kourtney Kardashian is still reeling from Mason&#8217;s decision to live with Scott.</p>



<p>“She is heartbroken over it,&#8221; the inside source reported.</p>



<p>&#8220;While Kourtney is giving Mason space to work through his feelings,&#8221; the insider explained, &#8220;at the end of the day, she blames Scott.”</p>

<p>The report adds that Kris Jenner &#8220;says Scott is a great dad and insists he&#8217;s not the one causing the drama.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, the momager insists that &#8220;Travis and Kourtney are [the source of the conflict].&#8221; Ouch!</p>



<p>“It’s kind of true,” the insider then argues. “Travis doesn’t hide the fact he hates Scott. He’s always trying to assert his dominance and Kourtney always backs him up. She’s still hanging on to old resentments, plus she’s very bitter that Mason has chosen to live with Scott.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Scott Disick wishes ill for Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are <em>many</em> perfectly reasonable circumstances to avoid an event because one specific person will be there. Sometimes, that person is your ex with whom you share children. There are many good reasons for which someone might want or even need to avoid someone.</p>



<p>However &#8230; that&#8217;s not Kourtney&#8217;s situation. While Scott certainly wronged her during their erstwhile relationship, they&#8217;ve spent plenty of time together since then. For their kids, for their reality careers, and more, they&#8217;ve even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/06/kourtney-kardashian-and-scott-disick-vacationing-in-costa-rica-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone on <em>vacations </em>together</a>.</p>



<p>Kourt clearly has some hurt feelings regarding her ex. That&#8217;s okay! But unless there are <em>huge </em>things that we don&#8217;t know about, she should probably just accept that Scott is part of the family. <em>She </em>made that choice when she had kids with him, after all.</p>

<p>Kourtney and North are practically twins.</p>



<p>Before our very eyes, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/north-west-growth-spurt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">North West is growing up</a>. She is 11 years old.</p>



<p>Over the years, fans have debated whether she more closely resembles her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/kanye-west-sued-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced father</a> or her famous mom.</p>



<p>Right now, a lot of fans are saying <em>neither</em>. North is twinning with her aunt Kourtney Kardashian, instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-north-west-is-11-years-old-and-she-looks-like">North West is 11 years old, and she looks like &#8230;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/11/north-west-hilariously-roasts-kim-kardashian-mom-cant-cook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When North was younger</a> &#8212; even just a year or two ago &#8212; many commented that she resembled her father, disgraced rapper Kanye West.</p>



<p>In Kim Kardashian&#8217;s recent back-to-school photos of her kids, which you can see above, North had clearly begun a growth spurt. Between that and her styling herself differently, many fans remarked that she resembled her mom.</p>



<p>Now, people are remarking upon the similarities between Kourtney and North. And you can see what they mean.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for children to resemble their parents&#8217; close relatives &#8212; even more closely than they resemble the parent. The way that spindle fibers divide DNA during meiosis can mean that family traits that did not manifest in a parent show up in their child. As a result, someone looks more like their aunt&#8217;s child than their mother&#8217;s.</p>



<p>No matter who a child most closely resembles, aging and a sense of style can strongly impact facial features and apparent similarities. Sometimes, Kourtney bears a striking resemblance to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kris-jenner-tumor-the-kardashians-trailer-season-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kris Jenner</a>, for example.</p>



<p>Right now, North is a tween. She&#8217;s discovering her sense of style. While anyone might feel flattered at a comparison to Kourtney or to Kim, North will likely go through a series of looks as she grows into her adult self.</p>
