<p>We have some unfortunate news to report about one of reality TV&#8217;s most beloved stars.</p>



<p>Former Bachelorette <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/katie-thurston-reveals-breast-cancer-diagnosis-says-im-ready-to-fight-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Thurston was diagnosed with breast cancer</a> back in February.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s offered frequent, candid updates throughout her treatment, revealing earlier this week that she feared a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/katie-thurston-fears-she-has-stage-4-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage four cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Sadly, Katie revealed today that her worst fears were confirmed, and her cancer has spread to her liver.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-katie-thurston-says-she-remains-optimistic-about-her-treatment">Katie Thurston says she remains optimistic about her treatment</h2>



<p>“After days of waiting, unfortunately, I did find out today that my breast cancer has spread to the liver,” Katie shared in an Instagram post.</p>



<p>“It is fairly small, however, it does put me at stage four,&#8221; she continued, adding:</p>



<p>“I know stage four can sound very scary, and it can be.&#8221; </p>



<p>Obviously, this is not the news that Katie was hoping to receive following her latest round of tests.</p>

<p>Katie explained that despite the prognosis, she remains “very optimistic” about her future.</p>



<p>She informed fans that she is “triple positive,” and the cancerous spots on her liver are “fairly small and detected early.”</p>



<p>&#8220;43 days since diagnosis and still no treatment? There is a lot of testing and prep that goes into cancer treatment. One important test is checking to see if the cancer has metastasized (spread),&#8221; Katie added in a caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately for me, mine has and I am now #stage4breastcancer . I’ll finally start my treatment next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katie Thurston is experiencing all of life&#8217;s highs and lows these days.</p>



<p>As you may have heard, the former <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/katie-thurston-married-jeff-arcuri/">Bachelorette just got married to Jeff Arcuri</a> &#8212; and we&#8217;re so very happy for her.</p>



<p>As you also may have heard, however, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/katie-thurston-reveals-breast-cancer-diagnosis-says-im-ready-to-fight-this/">Thurston revealed in February</a> that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>



<p>The former reality star is now here with an unfortunate update on this disease.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="814" height="702" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/994db021-905b-4417-b728-577bf7968731-156978_0645-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522107" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/994db021-905b-4417-b728-577bf7968731-156978_0645-copy.jpg 814w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/994db021-905b-4417-b728-577bf7968731-156978_0645-copy-300x259.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/994db021-905b-4417-b728-577bf7968731-156978_0645-copy-768x662.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katie Thurston back during her run as The Bachelorette.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After announcing she was diagnosed with <em>stage 3</em> breast cancer last month, Thurston said on Thursday that there has been <em>another</em> setback &#8230; and that her upcoming treatment must be paused because doctors have discovered spots on her liver.</p>



<p>“My biopsy is scheduled Friday which would have been my treatment day,” the 34-year-old wrote on her Boobie Broadcast Channel on Instagram March 24. “We now wait.”</p>



<p>Thurston said that her physician told her that she thinks the spots on her liver are cancerous, which would put her at a stage 4 diagnosis.</p>



<p>This is the most dangerous stage, the stage of breast cancer from which it&#8217;s hardest to recover.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-683x1024.jpg" alt="Katie Thurston on March 29, 2023." class="wp-image-521935" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0324_katiethurston_03-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katie Thurston attends the premiere of Whitney presents The OnlyFans Roast of Bert Kreischer on OFTV at Sunset at the Edition on March 29, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for OnlyFans)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“[The doctor] seemed to be leaning more on the cancer in the liver vs. optimistic,” the 34-year old continued. “This would put me at stage 4. I’d love to hear from my sisters who are stage 4 in terms of quality of life, motherhood, etc.”</p>



<p>Thurston also chronicles the emotional portion of her I-SPY clinical trial where she received an Zoladex injection to reduce the size of tumors.</p>



<p>“Do I cry too much?” she said as she reflected on the needle used for the procedure. “Hyperventilating too much? Not brave enough? I’m here to stay as long as they’ll allow it.”</p>

<p>In additional to the clinical trial &#8212; that also includes numeous rounds of chemotherapy before surgery &#8212; Thurston is undergoing IVF to freeze her eggs with the possibility of conceiving a child after her cancer treatment is complete.</p>



<p>Prayers up, everyone.</p>



<p>Stage 4 breast cancer signifies that the cancer cells have traveled from the original location in the breast to other organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.</p>



<p>The five-year survival rate for stage 4 breast cancer is around 31%, meaning that 31% of individuals diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer are expected to live at least five years after diagnosis.</p>

<p>This sad update comes days after Thurston confirmed that she and Jeff Arcuri were now husband and wife. </p>



<p>The spouses shared the news alongside a snapshot of them holding hands as they walked down a street while looking back at the camera.</p>



<p>Thurston captioned the sweet March 23 post by simply writing: <em><strong>We said “I do” on March twenty two</strong></em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-on-saturday-katie-thurston-married-jeff-arcuri">On Saturday, Katie Thurston married Jeff Arcuri</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-thurston-marries-jeff-arcuri-amid-breast-cancer-battle-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> reports that former <em>The Bachelorette</em> leading lady Katie Thurston married comedian Jeff Arcuri on Saturday, March 22.</p>



<p>Before that, the report details, Katie actually leaked the information &#8212; by accident &#8212; during an interview just two days earlier.</p>



<p>The topic was her stage 3 breast cancer diagnosis. As Katie discussed the impact of her treatments on their relationship, she spilled the proverbial beans.</p>

<p>“You would think it would cause more tribulation or problems between you,&#8221; Katie Thurston began.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it’s bonded us more than anything else,&#8221; she shared, &#8220;which is why we’re moving up the wedding a little bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, perhaps after realizing that she&#8217;d said more than she had intended, Katie specified: &#8220;We’re getting married in two days.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-timed-the-wedding-ahead-of-katie-thurston-s-cancer-treatments">They timed the wedding ahead of Katie Thurston&#8217;s cancer treatments</h2>



<p>A tearful Katie Thurston then gushed about Jeff Arcuri&#8217;s &#8220;sweet sentiment of being there for me&#8221; ahead of her new cancer treatments.</p>



<p>Starting on Thursday, March 27, Katie becomes part of the I-Spy breast cancer trial. This individualized treatment will likely include multiple rounds of chemo, followed by surgery. </p>



<p>“It was so sweet,&#8221; Katie described. &#8220;Obviously, we were wanting to plan a wedding. And there’s a lot of emotions that come in with chemo and the impact and the health and we don’t know what the next year looks like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Continuing the story, Katie Thurston shared how Jeff Arcuri had brought their wedding date even closer.</p>



<p>“And one night he said, ‘I want to show you that I still love you and that I’m here to stay. I’ll get married to you tomorrow,'&#8221; she recalled.</p>



<p>&#8220;We flew our parents in from Michigan and Washington State,&#8221; Katie detailed. She added: &#8220;We got our marriage license and a friend is just gonna marry us.”</p>

<p> “It was this kind gesture of him saying, truly, in sickness and in health,” Katie Thurston emphasized. “He is proving that he’s here to stay. He shows up every day and he does it in ways that just continue to surprise.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, cancer and other serious ailments are alarmingly common times for women to find that their partner or spouse has abandoned them. This couple is choosing a better path.</p>



<p>In addition to obtaining their marriage license and marrying, they are also planning a larger wedding ceremony &#8212; for after this cancer battle is over and won.</p>

<p>Last month, <em>Bachelorette</em> fans were shocked by the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/katie-thurston-reveals-breast-cancer-diagnosis-says-im-ready-to-fight-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Thurston had been diagnosed with breast cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Katie is opening up about her battle like never before.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <em>Good Morning America</em>, Katie reveals the devastation she felt upon receiving her diagnosis, and the ways in which her life has been upended by this unexpected twist.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-katie-details-the-moment-her-life-changed">Katie details the moment her life changed</h2>



<p>&#8220;It was the worst feeling I ever felt,&#8221; <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/video/bachelorette-katie-thurston-opens-breast-cancer-battle-119939668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thurston said</a> in her first sit-down interview since announcing her diagnosis.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so devastated. It&#8217;s so shocking. As a 34-year-old woman, you&#8217;re not prepared.&#8221;</p>



<p>Katie explained that she initially &#8220;brushed off&#8221; the lump that she found on her breast, assuming that it was merely &#8220;from working out&#8221; or her &#8220;time of the month.&#8221;</p>



<p>She went on to reveal the exact nature of her treatment:</p>



<p>&#8220;Because of the size of my tumor, I have to do chemo first to shrink it down, and then I can have it removed,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>News of her illness came shortly after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/katie-thurston-breaks-down-split-from-john-hersey-we-crashed-and-then-burned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie got engaged</a> to comedian Jeff Arcuri.</p>



<p>&#8220;We thought we&#8217;d be planning a wedding. We thought we&#8217;d be trying for a baby. Instead, this year is just dedicated to treatment and getting better</p>



<p>Katie revealed that she&#8217;s harvesting her eggs in hopes of starting a family later on, but noted that she and Jeff are also &#8220;okay with being a childless couple.&#8221;</p>



<p>The heartbreakingly candid interview comes just weeks after Katie shared her diagnosis in an equally blunt Instagram post.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have breast cancer,&#8221; she wrote. “Yesterday I saw all the couples post their Valentines Day celebrations. I felt envious if I’m being honest,” the reality star continued.</p>



<p>“Jeff took me to Hawaii and after, we were going to travel the world before planting roots together in NYC finally. But instead, my Vday was spent coordinating a place to live as I have to go back to LA for more testing and treatment.”</p>



<p>Detailing the process of finding out about the disease, Thurston explained to followers that she “had a small lump in my breast around the 10’oclock [sic] spot, adding</p>



<p>“I discovered it myself. Thought maybe it was my period [or] maybe it was muscle soreness from working out. But, eventually, this lump never went away.”</p>

<p>She said that she “experienced a range of emotions” during the period between then and now, when she decided to share it with the world.</p>



<p>“Despair. Anger. Sadness. Denial. And then strength. Purposeful. Ready. I cried a lot. I tried to even make a video instead of this post and couldn’t,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>“But one thing I did early on was search [for] other stories like mine. Other young women with breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma. Mastectomy. Pregnancy after breast cancer. All of their stories helped. So I intend to be the same for others.”</p>



<p>Katie concluded today&#8217;s interview with words of advice for other women, saying:</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait. Be proactive. Get checked out. You could be doing yourself a favor in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long-time resident of Bachelor Nation needs our thoughts and our prayers.</p>



<p>On February 15, Katie Thurston &#8212; a contestant on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelor">The Bachelor</a> Season 25 and the lead of The Bachelorette Season 17 &#8212; announced she had been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old confirmed her diagnosis in a “life update” on Saturday, thanking her fiancé, comedian Jeff Arcuri, and stating simply: <em>I have breast cancer</em>.</p>



<p>“Yesterday I saw all the couples post their Valentines Day celebrations. I felt envious if I’m being honest,” the reality star continued. </p>



<p>“Jeff took me to Hawaii and after, we were going to travel the world before planting roots together in NYC finally. But instead, my Vday was spent coordinating a place to live as I have to go back to LA for more testing and treatment.”</p>



<p>Detailing the process of finding out about the disease, Thurston explained to followers that she &#8220;had a small lump in my breast around the 10’oclock [sic] spot, adding</p>



<p>“I discovered it myself. Thought maybe it was my period [or] maybe it was muscle soreness from working out. But, eventually, this lump never went away.”</p>

<p>Thurston learned of her diagnosis with cancer two weeks ago.</p>



<p>She said that she “experienced a range of emotions” during the period between then and now, when she decided to share it with the world. </p>



<p>“Despair. Anger. Sadness. Denial. And then strength,” she wrote. “Purposeful. Ready. I cried a lot. I tried to even make a video instead of this post and couldn’t.”</p>



<p>Continued Thurston:</p>



<p>“But one thing I did early on was search [for] other stories like mine. Other young women with breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma. Mastectomy. Pregnancy after breast cancer. All of their stories helped. So I intend to be the same for others.”</p>

<p>This past June, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/katie-thurston-reveals-she-was-raped-i-refuse-to-feel-defeated/">Thurston opened up about having been raped</a> in the past. She&#8217;s been through a lot in her young life.</p>



<p>“This is day one of sharing and is going to be a long one,” Thurston wrote. “This first step of acceptance of my reality was the hardest. But I am ready to fight this.”</p>



<p>The former Bachelorette wrapped up her post by thanking her “extraordinary husband to be,” writing that she had “saved the best for last&#8221; and stating of Acuri:</p>



<p>I don’t know how I’d do this without you. The selfless love that you smother me in is beyond anything I imagined I’d be blessed with. I love you to the fullest in this lifetime and the next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thurston advanced far on Matt James&#8217; season of The Bachelor&#8230; prior to being named the lead of her own Bachelorette season a short time later.</p>



<p>She got engaged to Blake Moynes to conclude her season and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/katie-thurston-and-john-hersey-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-no-one/">then dated another contestant</a> after that engagement ended.</p>



<p>In a separate Instagram post over the weekend, Thurston said she is &#8220;waiting on learning what stage&#8221; of cancer she has, detailing:</p>



<p>&#8220;Getting another biopsy on my lymph node, which will tell me more. I once did a 23andMe [DNA test] and was informed I did not have the BRCA gene. I’ll be doing updated testing soon to know for sure. My family doesn’t have a history of breast cancer.”</p>



<p>In addition to chemotherapy, Thurston also plans to undergo a mastectomy.</p>



<p>“Not sure on the order yet,” she explained. “My fertility will be impacted by chemo. I have an appointment with my fertility doctor to preserve my eggs [first].”</p>

<p>Katie Thurston has opened up about something extremely personal and, unfortunately, extraordinarily painful.</p>



<p>On Friday, the former Bachelorette lead revealed to the public that she is a victim of sexual assault.</p>



<p>In a candid Instagram post, Thurston detailed her experience in the aftermath of this rape, which included getting a rape kit done and getting support from a Sexual Assault Response Team (SART).</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t delve into any details regarding the incident, including when it took place.</p>

<p>&#8220;My pain has purpose, my purpose has power, I want to focus on the positive,&#8221; Thurston wrote in her first slide on her account at the time, continuing as follows:</p>



<p>&#8220;The justice system continues to let down victims every day. I refuse to feel defeated in the strength it took to be an advocate for myself. I hope my experience will help those feel the strength and support they need.</p>



<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m not ready to share my story, I want to share the valuable resources that saved my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this latest admission, she went on:</p>



<p>&#8220;I called 911 to report my rape. They sent an officer to take my statement and then drove me to a special medical center to perform a SART exam&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I felt like a small lost child who was vulnerable and scared. </p>



<p>&#8220;They thoroughly explained the process, asking for consent along the way, and allowing me to decline or change my mind at any time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thurston accepted a proposal from Blake Moynes to close out her season&#8230; but then dated contestant John Hersey after and and Moynes ended their engagement.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/katie-thurston-and-john-hersey-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-no-one/">She and Hersey split up</a> in the summer of 2022.</p>

<p>Back to her awful experience, however&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;My blood was drawn to check for STDs, drugs, and blood alcohol concentration,&#8221; Thurston wrote on social media of the aftermath of the attack. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was given Plan B, Rocephin (a shot for bacterial infections), Azithromycin (to treat possible STIs), and Truvada and nPEP for a month (to treat possible HIV).&#8221;</p>



<p>She also her followers know that this can be done for anyone at no cost in San Diego, even without health insurance.</p>



<p>The former reality star said she was given digital tools to help her track the results of her medical examinations.</p>



<p>&#8220;My kit would take four months to complete its cycle. Nothing could move until this was done, so the time between allowed me to seek mental health support,&#8221; Thurston wrote.</p>

<p>An especially particularly vulnerable slide read: &#8220;I did everything I should have done as a victim of rape. &#8216;Here are my texts, my calls, my photos, my videos, names, witnesses, locations, social media, time stamps, surveillance footage, DNA, my body.&#8217;</p>



<p>This slide concluded:</p>



<p>&#8220;The warning &#8216;a guilty verdict is hard in criminal court&#8217; echoed throughout &amp; the months, like an annoying parrot you were forced to keep. And as much as l heard it, I still wasn&#8217;t ready to be stopped. And yet, without warning, I was.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thurston previously acknowledged on a Bachelorette episode in 2021 that she had been “involved in a situation where there wasn&#8217;t consent” 10 years earlier on New Year&#8217;s Eve, although it isn&#8217;t clear whether that incident is related to this one.</p>

<p>Thurston was a contestant on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelor/">The Bachelor</a> (as depicted above) prior to being handed The Bachelorette role.</p>



<p>In a statement to Entertainment Tonight after her Instagram post went viral, Katie shared: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had ample support from my community which allowed me to stay strong over these past seven months. </p>



<p>&#8220;While the outcome is disappointing, I am at peace and turning any pain into purpose and hope to help other survivors of sexual assault.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all over between Katie Thurston and John Hersey.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t exactly a newsworthy opening, it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/06/katie-thurston-and-john-hersey-its-over-to-the-surprise-of-no-one/">all over between Katie Thurston and John Hersey</a> for about two months now.</p>



<p>“Statement: no we aren’t together,” the former Bachelorette simply wrote on Instagram to announce the split in June, hinting at some bitterness between the exes.</p>



<p>Appearing Wednesday on Kaitlyn Bristowe&#8217;s Off The Vine podcast, Thurston did far more than just <em>hint</em> at this bitterness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Katie Thurston and John Hersey had a decent run as a romantic item. Alas, no one was shocked when they broke up.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;He dumped me,” Thurston said on the broadcast.</p>



<p>“Technically, we actually broke up twice. </p>



<p>&#8220;The first time no one knew about. … Like a week or two [later], we kind of worked through it and decided to get back together, so I thought we were golden.&#8221;</p>



<p>And then?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Katie Thurston and John Hersey split in June 2022. The former has said she was blindsided by the unfortunate break-up.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thurston didn&#8217;t delve into any real specifics.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it was just unavoidable,&#8221; she saidd. </p>



<p>&#8220;Like, we just got [into] a conversation and at one point, I just said to him, … ‘I know more reasons why you don’t like me than why you love me.'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And that’s a really sh-tty feeling.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>John Hersey is meeting Katie Thurston for the first time here on The Bachelorette. Months later, they started dating.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thurston and Hersey &#8212; who the former sent home during week two of her Bachelorette run &#8212; went public with their romance in November 2021&#8230; just one month after she ended her engagement to Blake Moynes.</p>



<p>&#8220;He said, ’I just really need someone who can enjoy my passions and who wants to watch surf, maybe learn surfing with me,” Katie continued on this podcast. </p>



<p>“I look at him and I go, ‘You realize I jumped out of a f-cking plane three times … to join him in his passions. </p>



<p>&#8220;Eight hours of ground school, all these things to partake in ‘his passion’ and somehow that was completely ignored and now we’re focused on surfing. At that point, I knew nothing I did was going to ever be good enough. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was really a blessing in disguise. … I think I would have stuck it out a lot longer than I should have. So like, now I’m in a very good place about it. </p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I was probably the saddest I’ve ever been.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Katie Thurston stares off into the distance here and appears to ponder the meaning of life.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thurston, who has confessed to mental health struggles since her time as The Bachelorette, labeled her romance with Hersey as &#8220;six months crash and burn.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said she bought him a van. She let him quit his job. She adjusted to him in every way possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was like, whatever you need me to be, I will be,&#8221; Katie noted to Bristowe. </p>



<p>&#8220;In hindsight, that&#8217;s not healthy. That&#8217;s not good.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Thurston says she and Hersey are on &#8220;good&#8221; terms now, but there&#8217;s clearly at least <em>some</em> tension there.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was very frustrated with how our breakup was handled after the fact because I do think he cares what these strangers think about him and us,” Thurston said on Wednesday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was literally, like, cornered into a wall to essentially come out quicker than I wanted to about it. So I said ‘Fine.’&#8221;</p>



<p>In his own post-split message, Hersey wrote on social media:</p>



<p>&#8220;As Katie stated earlier, we are no longer dating. The decision was not made lightly and it was obviously not an easy one to make.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Katie Thurston smirks here for an ABC promotional photo on behalf of her Bachelorette season.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking ahead? Thurston will obviously date again, but Bachelor Nation is now off limits, she says:</p>



<p>&#8220;I am not dipping into that pool anymore. … I don&#8217;t want to generalize that much, but it&#8217;s a certain type.</p>



<p>&#8220;Either they&#8217;re a certain type or the show changes them a little bit and they become a certain type. … I&#8217;ve already done it twice. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not interested and, like, there&#8217;s been some that have slid into my DMs and in talking to them, it&#8217;s just, like, so cringy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Katie Thurston is biting the hand that fed her&#8230; a decent amount of fame and fortune.</p>
<p>The 31-year old rose to fame as a suitor on The Bachelor and then as the lead on The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>And yet, in the wake of the Love is Blind Season 2 finale, Thurston just hurled some shade at the ABC franchise while heaping praise on the Netflix reality show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Oh I&#8217;m obsessed with this show genuine connections without the distractions of made-up drama and field games,&quot; Thurston wrote of Love is Blind on Monday, giving this romantic competition a compliment.</p>
<p>At the same time, she clearly took a shot at The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>Unless you somehow think Thurston was NOT talking about this latter program when citing&nbsp;<strong><em>made-up drama and field games</em></strong>&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Both The Bachelorette and Love is Blind chronicle couples who aspire to get married.</p>
<p>Love Is Blind Season 2, for example, featured a number of engagements (including a few viewers didn&#8217;t see) that took place before the men and women in question ever saw each other.</p>
<p>The series is truly &quot;blind,&quot; as its title states and promises, keeping participants separate until they accept a proposal.</p>
<p>Of the six pairs at the center on the series, <a href="/2022/02/love-is-blind-season-2-finale-who-got-engaged-who-bailed-at-the/">two said &quot;I do&quot; at the end</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Thurston, meanwhile, concluded her run as The Bachelorette with an engagement to Blake Moynes.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2021/10/katie-thurston-splits-from-blake-moynes-surprises-absolutely-no/">couple broke up in October</a>, however, with Moynes eventually accusing his ex of having an emotional affair, if not an all-out physical one, after Thurston was spotted out a short time later with John Hersey, a suitor Katie had previously sent home.</p>
<p>Hersey and Thurston are still dating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think there was any physical cheating there, but there [was] clearly emotional [cheating] for it to transition as quickly as it did,&quot; Moynes said late last year on the Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation podcast, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I feel stupid and foolish for allowing it to happen, to some degree.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In a lengthy Reddit response back then, Hersey emphasized that there was nothing sordid at play by himself or by Thurston, as he always respected his now girlfriend&#8217;s relationship with Moynes.</p>
<p>&quot;The boundaries of our friendship with respect to her ongoing relationship never even required addressing, because it was never a thought in our minds that we would ever be anything more.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys- she was engaged,&quot; Hersey wrote.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>He concluded at that time:</p>
<p>&quot;It is apparent that many of you misjudge how both her and I view that commitment.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither Katie nor I would ever cheat, push someone to cheat, or be involved in cheating.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not in our nature. It is not acceptable. It is not okay.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>When <a href="/2021/07/greg-grippo-is-a-huge-liar-and-phony-and-needs-to-get-sent-home/">Greg Grippo quit Katie Thurston&#8217;s season of <em>The Bachelorette</em></a>, viewers were unsure of how to feel.</p>
<p>Some felt that Greg had merely listened to his heart and decided that he couldn&#8217;t continue with a woman who was unable to tell him that she loved him.</p>
<p>Others believed that he demonstrated a lack of understanding for how the show worked, and he should&#8217;ve allowed Katie to make her final decision before expecting any sort of commitments or grand proclamations.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it was one of the most unexpected departures in franchise history, and it hung like a dark cloud over the rest of the season.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Even after <a href="/2021/10/katie-thurston-and-blake-moynes-the-surprising-reason-they-broke/">Katie accepted Blake Moynes&#8217; proposal</a>, there was speculation that she was really in love with Greg.</p>
<p>And when <a href="/2021/10/katie-thurston-splits-from-blake-moynes-surprises-absolutely-no/">Katie and Blake broke up</a>, there were were rumors that she planned to go running back to Grippo.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t happen, of course, but it seems that many citizens of Bachelor Nation are still curious about what might have been for Katie and Greg.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Grippo appeared on the &quot;We Met at Acme&quot; podcast this week to answer some questions and address some of the allegations that viewers leveled at him after his abrupt departure.</p>
<p>(You may recall the rumors that <a href="/2021/08/greg-grippos-shady-behavior-to-be-revealed-in-bachelorette-final/">Grippo was a professional actor</a> who was merely interested in using the show to boost his career.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a really tough decision to leave. It was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever had to, you know, choose for myself,&quot; Greg told listeners.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;It was tough, especially after hearing everyone saying like, &lsquo;Oh, I was acting or I ran away when it got too serious,&rsquo;&rdquo; the New Jersey native explained, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/greg-grippo-quit-the-bachelorette-because-it-felt-too-scripted/">according to</a> <em>Us Weekly</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, for me, I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;What if she said I love you back, guys?&rsquo; Like, I couldn&rsquo;t leave then, you know, I would have known then [that] this is gonna be my wife, I wouldn&rsquo;t have left.&quot;</p>
<p>Greg makes an interesting point &#8212; if he was being disingenuous when he told Katie that he loved her and was looking for an excuse to exit the show, then that was quite a gamble.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After all, if she had reciprocated, he would&#8217;ve been in quite a bind!</p>
<p>No, Grippo claims that he was 100 percent sincere in his declaration of love.</p>
<p>In fact, he says it was Katie who was more interested in creating compelling television than in forming a lasting romance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;It felt, like, a little too scripted and felt like, &lsquo;Alright, we need to play by [the rules]&rsquo; &mdash; I had no problem going into, like, the fantasy suite and there being two other guys there,&quot; Greg recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&rsquo;t looking for the show to end. I wasn&rsquo;t at all. I wanted us to communicate on a mutual level in those moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grippo went on to say that he understands that there are &ldquo;steps&rdquo; to filming a show like <em>The Bachelorette</em>, but he didn&rsquo;t feel the &ldquo;mutual love&rdquo; from Katie, and so, he decided to take off.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is also the rest of my life. And if this is going to be the person I marry, I want it to be completely real,&quot; Grippo explained.</p>
<p>&quot;And, like, yeah, I want to show my family after and be like, &lsquo;Look that we accomplished, look at what we went through,&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the hardest things, I feel like, to make it out of the mud with someone, you know, [on] that damn dating show.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Greg said he has no ill will for Katie, and unlike some <em>Bachelorette</em> viewers, he believes her feelings for Blake were sincere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to think on my end [that] the feelings that we had were real, but I just truly believe that she had stronger feelings for Blake [Moynes], who ended up getting engaged to her after,&quot; he recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, I was even calling producers after [I quit], I was DMing, like, Kaitlyn Bristowe &mdash; nobody was answering me &mdash; but I was like, &lsquo;Is she with him? Did they end up together? Is she coming back to New Jersey?&rsquo;&rdquo; Greg said.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I was calling producers left and right. I was also telling my family, I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Guys, I think there&rsquo;s a better chance than not [we get back together] because let me tell you, it&rsquo;s like very real between us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These days, <a href="/2021/11/katie-thurston-blake-moynes-who-im-dating-another-bachelorette-s/">Katie is dating John Hershey</a>, but even though her relationship with Greg ended in dramatic fashion, Grippo wants to impart to viewers that his was real, and there was no manipulation from either part.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&ldquo;I felt like people were tossing around that word. &hellip; I&rsquo;m, like, truly trying to understand what people were trying to say like, you know, [saying I was] really manipulating her mindset &mdash; and that&rsquo;s the furthest thing from what I was trying to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a sliver of my intention was to gaslight her at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greg revealed he didn&#8217;t leave his bed for 10 days after he and Katie went their separate ways, but he says that these days, his mental health is on the upswing.</p>
<p>As messy as their breakup was, we&#8217;re sure Katie would be happy to hear that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>So much for an amicable breakup.</p>
<p>Blake Moynes no longer has anything positive to say about Katie Thurston.</p>
<p>As you likely recall, Moynes won Katie Thurston&#8217;s season of The Bachelorette this summer, concluding his run by getting down on one knee and proposing.</p>
<p>Thurston said yes&#8230; but then the couple split a short time later.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Not exactly shocking, considering how few couples who meet on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette actually make it to the altar.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, we learned that Thurston had moved on &#8212; with yet another suitor from her season.</p>
<p>She is now dating <a href="/2021/11/katie-thurston-blake-moynes-who-im-dating-another-bachelorette-s/">John Hershey</a>.</p>
<p>How does Moynes feel about his ex finding a new lover so soon?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Not too great!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think there was any physical cheating there, but there [was] clearly emotional [cheating] for it to transition as quickly as it did,&quot; Moynes said Wednesday on the Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation podcast, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I feel stupid and foolish for allowing it to happen, to some degree.&quot;</p>
<p>We get it. We can&#8217;t really blame the guy for feeling this way.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Moynes only just found out about Thurston and Hershey a few days ago, just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it was partially me, too, like, was she emotionally cheating to some degree because I wasn&rsquo;t able to provide something with words of affirmation, which I know I struggle with sometimes,&rdquo; he added on the podcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to stand by having no regrets.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is instances like this where you really start to fight yourself with having no regrets just with the way things played out.&quot;</p>

<p>Thurston herself hinted at her new romance when she dedicated Taylor Swift&lsquo;s &ldquo;Begin Again&rdquo; to Hersey on the final day of her &ldquo;12 Days of Messy&rdquo; challenge this past Tuesday.</p>
<p>The post featured a montage of sweet moments between the former Bachelorette and Hersey, who Thurston originally sent home during week two of her journey.</p>
<p>Page Six has since confirmed the romance.</p>
<p>&quot;I know they spent a lot of time together and stuff but there&#8217;s just no way. I never had an inkling,&quot; Moynes said on airr.</p>
<p>&quot;I am just a very secure guy and I give my trust out 100 percent, especially to the person who I should be trusting the most.&quot;</p>

<p>On October 25, <a href="/2021/10/katie-thurston-splits-from-blake-moynes-surprises-absolutely-no/">Moynes and Thurston announced their split</a>, saying in a statement:</p>
<p><em>It is with mutual love and respect that we have decided to go our separate ways. </em></p>
<p><em>We are so grateful for the moments we shared together and the entire journey that has unfolded this year, but we ultimately have concluded that we are not compatible as life partners, and it is the most caring choice for both of us to move forward independently.</em></p>
<p><em>We ask for kindness and privacy as we both navigate this transition. Both of us will forever want the best for one another and ask you to please support us in our decision.</em></p>

<p>Moynes, meanwhile, is a tad bit bitter over how this all has played out.</p>
<p>I just thought that she might at least tell me on the side just because we have had very cordial and easy conversations through text [since the breakup].</p>
<p>&quot;Why not reach out to me and tell me that?&quot; he said on the podcast.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s a little lack of respect there. The way that she&#8217;s handled things, I am not overly surprised.&quot;</p>
