<p>Jax Taylor has opened up about something so very personal and painful. Yet also inspiring.</p>



<p>The reality star&#8217;s son has been diagnosed with autism.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for a while,” Taylor told Extra on April 9, referring to ex-Brittany Cartwright and adding: </p>



<p>“Brittany and I have been going back and forth on how we wanted to tell everybody. My little boy is amazing. He’s so beautiful. He’s so delicious. He’s such a smart individual you know, but he’s obviously got some issues with autism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier that same day, Cartwright announced in an interview with People Magazine that the estranged spouses&#8217; three-year old had been diagnosed six months before.</p>



<p>“I want to be affiliated with autism for the rest of my life,” Taylor said in the wake of this confirmation. </p>



<p>“I want to be in charities. I want to be whatever I can do to spread awareness to help financially, physically, mental. I want to be a part of it all. I feel like this is a sign from somebody that I need to be a part of this world and I want to help out other parents. I want to meet other parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taylor recently admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jax-taylor-reveals-massive-cocaine-bender-following-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">serious and dangerous cocaine use</a>.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s also said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-reveals-bipolar-disorder-ptsd-diagnoses-amid-divorce-filing/">he has bipolar disorder</a>.</p>



<p>In this latest case of candor, the Vanderpump Rules alum added: </p>



<p>“When you see other kids … progressing a little bit further than your son and you’re like ‘Why aren’t they understanding?’ It can be a little frustrating, but I know he’ll get there. He’s just taking a little longer.”</p>

<p>Cartwright, 3for her part6, told People that Cruz is mostly nonverbal, yet will “sporadically say different words.” </p>



<p>She said it’s “difficult because I’ve never heard him say, ‘I love you.’ But he is so loving, and he shows me he loves me every single day. He is such a mommy’s boy.”</p>



<p>Continued Brittany on this sensitive topic:</p>



<p>“This is the time he’s building his brain.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m just trying to do everything I possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever. I feel very blessed that I’m able to give him everything that he needs, and that’s why I want to help as many mothers as I can. I have learned so much over the past couple years.”</p>

<p>Taylor, meanwhile, is trying to rebuild his life.</p>



<p>He told Extra Extra that Cruz “is my sole force, my driving force to being here today. That little boy is my angel. I love him more than anything in the world.”</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <em>The Valley</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jax-taylor-reveals-cocaine-addiction-in-shocking-new-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor admitted to being a cocaine addict</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it wasn&#8217;t exactly a shocking revelation to those who had witnessed Jax&#8217;s behavior during his eight seasons on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>But the important thing was that the troubled Bravo star had taken the necessary steps to get sober.</p>



<p>These days, Jax says he&#8217;s 100 days clean from coke and booze &#8212; but he admits that getting to this point was no easy feat.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2200879492-1-1024x710.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor attends the LA art show opening night premiere party hosted by Jenna Dewan at Los Angeles Convention Center on February 19, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-says-he-did-enough-cocaine-to-kill-a-horse-following-divorce">Jax says he did &#8216;enough cocaine to kill a horse&#8217; following divorce</h2>



<p>In a new interview with <em>Us Weekly</em>, Jax admits to going on an epic bender in the weeks after his former wife <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-breaks-silence-on-brittany-cartwright-divorce-she-made-the-right-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Cartwright filed for divorce</a>.</p>



<p>“I was in my house by myself for months. I wasn’t eating. I was drinking and doing enough cocaine to kill a small horse. I went on a full-on tear,&#8221; <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jax-taylor-talks-rock-bottom-status-with-brittany-cartwright-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he told the outlet</a>.</p>



<p>Jax added that he was “so depressed” because he felt like he had “lost everything” when Brittany pulled the plug on their their nearly five-year marriage.</p>



<p>“The devil on my shoulder was louder than that angel on my shoulder,” he explained.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-reveals-regrets-about-decades-of-addiction">Jax reveals regrets about decades of addiction</h2>



<p>Jax went on to reveal that he regrets not only his behavior in his years of active addiction, but also the amount of money that he spent on intoxicants.</p>



<p>“I could probably buy a house for the amount of money I’ve spent on drugs,” he said. “It’s sickening to me. My parents did not raise this kind of person.”</p>



<p>Taylor says he hit rock bottom in the final year of his marriage to Brittany, when he saw himself creating chaos but felt powerless to stop it.</p>

<p>According to Jax, Brittany convinced him to check back into rehab after his first stint in treatment proved ineffective.</p>



<p>“I had flashes of everything you’re not supposed to do as a parent. [Cartwright] was like, ‘He needs to go back.’ I didn’t put up a fight,&#8221; he told Us.</p>



<p>Brittany says she still has her doubts about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax&#8217;s ability to remain sober</a>, but apparently, he doesn&#8217;t share those misgivings.</p>



<p>These days, he says he&#8217;s the &#8220;healthiest [he has] ever been” and has zero doubt that he&#8217;ll remain on the right path.</p>



<p>“I know for a fact I’ll never touch it again,” he said. “People are like, ‘Well, you don’t know.’ No, I know.”</p>



<p>We wish him all the best on his continuing recovery journey.</p>

<p>Earlier today, we reported on the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jax-taylor-reveals-cocaine-addiction-in-shocking-new-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax Taylor has admitted to battling cocaine addiction</a> for most of his adult life.</p>



<p>Anyone who bore witness to Jax&#8217;s chaotic tenure on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> might consider that the least shocking confession of all time.</p>



<p>But the good news is that Jax is now 83 days sober and speaking publicly about his substance abuse issues for the first time.</p>



<p>The bad news, of course, is that in order to get to this point, he had to tear down his marriage, and his wife says  that process was even more horrific than what we saw on screen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-cartwright-says-she-s-skeptical-about-jax-s-sobriety">Brittany Cartwright says she&#8217;s &#8216;skeptical&#8217; about Jax&#8217;s sobriety</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Cartwright filed for divorce from Jax</a> back in August of 2024, and it seems that she has zero regrets about that decision.</p>



<p>She was quick to respond to today&#8217;s confession, revealing that she&#8217;s happy the truth is finally out, but she still has her doubts about Jax&#8217;s ability to turn things around.</p>



<p>Brittany added that Jax is still engaging in &#8220;alarming&#8221; behavior, and she has doubts about his commitment to getting sober.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="735" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1060408298-3-735x1024.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright attends the People's Choice Awards 2018 at Barker Hangar on November 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California.

<p>“His behaviors are still alarming, and his treatment plan seems to be the bare minimum,” she told <em><a href="https://people.com/brittany-cartwright-reacts-to-ex-jax-taylor-revealing-his-cocaine-addiction-and-substance-issues-exclusive-11690144">People</a> </em>magazine, addinh that co-parenting her 3-year-old son Cruz with Jax “is still a challenge and very difficult.”</p>



<p>“For the first time, I can speak openly about the extent of trauma he’s instilled on our family over the years,” Brittany said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-difficult-situation-with-tremendously-high-stakes">A difficult situation with tremendously high stakes</h2>



<p>Brittany says she wishes the bast for Jax, but that her top priority is, as always, the health and wellness of her son.</p>



<p>“I’m trying to navigate this as best as I can for my son and I, but every day is still a challenge and very difficult,&#8221; she revealed.</p>



<p>“Jax has caused an enormous amount of damage, and I have very little trust in him at this point,” Cartwright continued. “My only hope is that one day, he will be a better person for his son.”</p>

<p>These days, Jax says he&#8217;s mostly sober, but still “smoke[s] weed a little bit … to go to sleep.”</p>



<p>He admits that he&#8217;s not on good terms with Brittany, explaining, “It changes. One day she’s happy, one day she’s mad. …. I never know what I’m going to get with her.</p>



<p>“I walk on eggshells constantly — as I should,” Taylor  continued. “I just want her to know that I’m really, really trying. I’m doing everything she’s asked.”</p>



<p>Jax has made a lot of mistakes in his life. But here&#8217;s hoping he can make up for lost time &#8212; if not for his sake, then for his kid&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is coming clean about <em>getting</em> clean.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of Alex Baskin‘s “Hot Mic” podcast, the Vanderpump Rules alum announced very simply and straightforwardly on air:</p>



<p> “I am an addict.”</p>



<p>Taylor then delved into very personal detail about how this applies to him.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="953" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-1024x953.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520628" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-1024x953.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-300x279.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-768x715.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-2048x1906.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-960x893.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-1080x1005.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2150562504-1200x1117.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor attends the 2024 White House Correspondents&#8217; Dinner at The Washington Hilton on April 27, 2024 in Washington, DC. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I have substance issues &#8212; primarily with cocaine. It’s hard to say out loud,” Jax confessed. “I’ve been dealing with this on and off since I was 23 and now I’m 45. There was times where I would stop doing it but then there were times where I’d go heavy on it.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">Brittany Cartwright filed to divorce Taylor</a> last August.</p>



<p>Around this same time, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/">Taylor checked into a facility</a> to deal with mental health issues.</p>



<p>However, this podcast marked the first time he has ever admitted to these kinds of substance abuse problems.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1024x710.jpg" alt="Jax Taylor attends the LA art show opening night premiere party hosted by Jenna Dewan at Los Angeles Convention Center on February 19, 2025 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-519947" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-768x533.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-2048x1420.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-960x666.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200879492-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor attends the LA art show opening night premiere party hosted by Jenna Dewan at Los Angeles Convention Center on February 19, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for LA Art Show)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taylor &#8212; who made his Bravo debut on Vanderpump Rules in 2013 &#8212; acknowledged that viewers and fans had picked up on this abuse over the years. </p>



<p>“[They] could kind of tell that I was on something. Obviously production and [other] people, they didn’t know what I was doing,” he said. &#8220;Everything I was doing was on my own but I was just on that train and I couldn’t get off.”</p>



<p>To help him stay off cocaine, Taylor went on to say he recently cut alcohol out of his life, as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’m proud to say I’m 83 days sober right now, which is the longest I’ve ever gone in my life without [alcohol or drugs],&#8221; Taylor told listeners on March 4.</p>



<p>Jax has not said much in public about his split from Cartwright.</p>



<p>His fellow reality star, however, has cited &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/">rage texts</a>&#8221; and other anger issues as a major basis for why she finally walked away from her spouse.</p>



<p>Taylor doesn&#8217;t bring up the divorce in this new interview, but does at least come across like a changed man; like he understands where he went wrong in many ways.</p>

<p>“For many years I’ve depended on alcohol and drugs as a way to cope and mask many deeper issues,&#8221; Taylor added separately on Tuesday to Us Weekly. </p>



<p>&#8220;This past year has been the hardest year of my life but also the most eye opening and transformative. Coming to terms with my many mental health challenges and being honest about my addiction — both with myself and others has been a crucial part of my healing. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been a day-by-day process, but I’m committed to my recovery and working towards a healthier future in order to be a better person and someone my son will be proud of one day.”</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is no stranger to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Over the course of his eight seasons on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax boozed</a>, cheated, berated his co-stars, and made just about every kind of bad decision under the sun.</p>



<p>Not many people are surprised, that <a href="http://thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-hasnt-changed-jax-taylor-alleges-he-still-has-rage-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax&#8217;s marriage to Brittany Cartwright didn&#8217;t last</a>, but the Bravo veteran &#8212; who currently appears on <em>The Valley</em> &#8212; swears he&#8217;s changed his ways.</p>



<p>And in an ironic twist that no one saw coming, Jax is now passing moral judgment on his former VPR costars.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lisa-vanderpump-s-surprising-stance-on-james">Lisa Vanderpump&#8217;s surprising stance on James</h2>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-breaks-silence-on-domestic-violence-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Kennedy was arrested</a> back in December following an incident at Kathy Hilton&#8217;s holiday party.</p>



<p>He wasn&#8217;t charged, but the altercation led to the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ally-lewber-confirms-james-kennedy-split-admits-yes-he-assaulted-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of James&#8217; relationship with Ally Lewber</a>.</p>



<p>We might never know for sure exactly what happened, but it sounds like James &#8212; whose substance abuse and anger issues have been well-documented &#8212; got up to his old tricks.</p>



<p>Which is why it was so surprising when his old boss, Lisa Vanderpump, came to his defense.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-1024x713.jpg" alt='Lisa Vanderpump attends the annual Keep Memory Alive "Power of Love" gala benefit for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health honoring Jimmy Kimmel at MGM Grand Garden Arena on February 22, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada.' class="wp-image-519948" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-1080x752.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201431125-1200x835.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lisa Vanderpump attends the annual Keep Memory Alive &#8220;Power of Love&#8221; gala benefit for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health honoring Jimmy Kimmel at MGM Grand Garden Arena on February 22, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I have spoken to James and to Ally at great length,” she told <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lisa-vanderpump-addresses-james-kennedys-domestic-violence-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> in the wake of the incident.</p>



<p>“I didn’t need to just hear from James. I needed to hear from Ally, too, from her mouth what happened. She told me categorically he didn’t hurt her. He never hurts her. They were both drinking.”</p>



<p>Lisa added that Ally only had James arrested because she wanted to &#8220;teach him a lesson.&#8221;</p>



<p>“She basically said, ‘Oh yes, take him away. It’ll teach him a lesson,&#8217;” Vanderpump told <em>Us</em>. “But no, he didn’t hurt her categorically. … She regrets what happened with how this blew up.”</p>

<p>Asked about his relationship with Lisa during a recent appearance on the &#8220;When Reality Hits&#8221; podcast, Jax made it clear that he&#8217;s not a fan of the West Hollywood restaurateur.</p>



<p>“No, I don’t talk to her anymore. To be honest with you, I don’t really take kindly to her,” he said (via <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/02/21/jax-taylor-slams-lisa-vanderpump-for-her-treatment-of-kristen-doute-ally-lewber-while-defending-james-kennedy-after-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>).</p>



<p>He explained that he was shocked that Lisa would defend James, who was previously in a toxic relationship with Jax&#8217;s <em>Vanderpump</em> co-star Kristen Doute.</p>



<p>“The way she treated Kristen, the things she said about Kristen and her lack of empathy,” Jax said.</p>

<p>“The way she handled the James and Ally situation. I personally think that was wrong. Kristen is my dear friend and the things [Lisa] said was just not OK.”</p>



<p>Kristen previously slammed Lisa&#8217;s comments as &#8220;absolutely disgusting and diabolical.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some fans were surprised by the news that Jax is not on speaking terms with Lisa, as she serves as an executive producer on The Valley.</p>



<p>“It’s a spinoff, so [Lisa] will always get a credit that’s how tv works,” he claimed in <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/01/09/fans-slam-jax-taylor-for-continuing-to-take-credit-for-creating-the-valley-jax-insists-lisa-vanderpump-has-no-part-of-the-show-despite-being-an-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a>.</p>



<p>That might be the case &#8212; but then again, Jax doesn&#8217;t have the greatest history when it comes to telling the truth, so who knows?</p>

<p>According to Brittany Cartwright, Jax Taylor&#8217;s time in rehab didn&#8217;t change him one bit.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> or the Jax-and-Brittany-based spinoff, <em>The Valley</em>, then you&#8217;re probably aware that Jax sometimes struggles to control his temper.</p>



<p>And by that, we mean he throws more temper tantrums than his three-year-old son.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brittany-cartwright-says-rehab-didn-t-help-jax-taylor">Brittany Cartwright Says Rehab Didn&#8217;t Help Jax Taylor</h2>



<p>Shortly after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/brittany-cartwright-my-sex-life-with-jax-sucked-before-our-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany separated from Jax </a>earlier in March, he made the decision to try and regulate some of the personal issues that had caused so many problems in his relationships.</p>



<p>Jax checked into rehab and vowed to change for the sake of his wife and son. Sadly, it seems that his efforts fell flat.</p>



<p>These days, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/brittany-cartwright-i-am-still-separated-from-jax-taylor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax and Brittany are still separated</a>, and she recently filed for divorce. And in a new interview with Bravo producer Alex Baskin, Brittany says Jax is as angry as ever.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like he changed at all in those 30 days. And the reason, I’m sure it’ll be on the show as well, but, you know, a lot of rage texting and stuff was still going on the entire time that he was in rehab,” she said.</p>



<p>“So, for me, I was just noticing like, this is just going to be constant.</p>



<p>“Like, if you’re in therapy seven hours a day, and you’re still finding time to call me names and cuss me out? And send me rage texts? Then you’re obviously not ever gonna change,&#8221; Brittany continued.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In the interview, Brittany explained that she decided to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file for divorce while Jax was in rehab </a>so that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to talk her out of it.</p>



<p>“I’m so glad I did, I’m not changing my mind. I’m so happy with this decision,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that Jax&#8217;s actions led her to realize, “This is bad, I can’t stay in this. It was very eye-opening.”</p>

<p>Brittany also spoke about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/brittany-cartwright-hook-up-after-jax-taylor-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hooking up with Jax&#8217;s longtime friend Julian Sensley</a>.</p>



<p>She says the decision was motivated by the fact that “it was somebody that [she] felt [she] knew,” and she “always thought he was so hot.”</p>



<p>“I was just so mad at Jax. I didn’t care if I hurt his feelings like that. Why should I care? [Jax] never cared about how he hurt my feelings for years,&#8221; Brittany explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;He put me down. He did so much to me that, I’m sorry you’re so upset about who it is, but at the same time, you didn’t give me attention, affection or anything for years.</p>

<p>“So, I was like, you know what? This guy is really hot, and I was taking care of myself, and Jax has no legs to stand on. He hooked up with my friend, let’s all remember that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, not only did <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/06/faith-stowers-jax-taylor-needs-to-be-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jax hook up with Faith Stowers</a>, he did so while he and Brittany were dating!</p>



<p>So he really has no right to get mad at his ex for what she did after she filed for divorce.</p>



<p>But this is Jax Taylor we&#8217;re talking about. So he&#8217;s probably already thrown multiple tantrums over it.</p>

<p>After 11 seasons on Bravo, it&#8217;s hard to think that <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> could be canceled. </p>



<p>Unless, of course, you&#8217;re actually watching the show.</p>



<p>The truth of the matter is, fans are pretty disenchanted with the long-running reality show post-Scandoval. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the show&#8217;s new spin-off, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/vanderpump-villa-hulu-spinoff-details-cast-location-premiere-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanderpump Villa</a></em>, is turning out to be a major hit. </p>

<p>So, is <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>about to be canceled? According to insiders, the answer might be yes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vanderpump-rules-no-longer-bravo-ready-to-cancel-after-11th-season">&#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217; No Longer: Bravo Ready To Cancel After 11th Season</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/vanderpump-rules-season-12-filming-delayed-bravo-pause-summer-the-valley-1235900585/">many predicted</a>, production for the show&#8217;s 12th season did <em>not</em> begin in May, as it had in previous years.</p>



<p>And in recent months, many fans noted that <a href="https://people.com/vanderpump-rules-is-not-been-canceled-is-on-hiatus-8665544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several stars had deleted all mention of the series</a> from their social media accounts. </p>



<p>For obvious reasons, the situation led to rumors that the show had come to an end. But Bravo sources insist that that&#8217;s not the case.</p>





<p>“Everyone needs a moment to decompress after two very rough, intense seasons. The cast is looking forward to a break from filming the show,&#8221; a source close to the situation told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/30/entertainment/vanderpump-rules-pausing-production-for-the-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“Producers are excited to catch up with everyone when cameras eventually go back up,”</p>

<p>Producers&#8217; new goal, the outlet claims, is to give the cast some time &#8212; let their lives &#8220;breathe&#8221; &#8212; in the hope that some new drama will develop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ariana-madix-problem">The Ariana Madix Problem</h2>



<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of Ariana Madix, who&#8217;s booked and busy, and who may be starting to feel like her reality career has run its course.</p>



<p>Ariana is now the new host of <em>Love Island US</em>, and she revealed at a recent book festival that she&#8217;s considered quitting <em>Vanderpump</em>.</p>

<p>“Our show has always thrived, it’s always at its best when it is at its most authentic and its most real, and I have to be able to show up and be real and be authentic in order for it to make sense for me,” she said at a book festival.</p>



<p>“So that’s the question I would be asking myself going into it,” she explained.</p>



<p>Other insiders have noted that the recent success of <em>Vanderpump Villa</em> might be a bad sign for the VPR OGs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many may not know this, but <em>Vanderpump Villa</em> is actually a test to see if it can be as big of a show as <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>An insider revealed this tidbit to <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/11034791/vanderpump-villa-replace-vanderpump-rules-chopping-block/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a></em>, explaining that Bravo has seen the writing on the wall, and the future of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> is bleak. </p>



<p>Fans have been revolting, even organizing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/vanderpump-rules-fans-boycott-show-after-worst-episode-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boycotts of the show</a> since it feels so tired. </p>



<p>And this this new spinoff feels like a fresh start, which might be exactly what the franchise needs. </p>

<p></p>



<p>The Hulu show follow Lisa and her hot &#8220;world-class staff&#8221; as they serve guests of Chateau Rosabelle, Lisa&#8217;s French countryside estate. It&#8217;s got everything: travel, drama, and attractive problematic young people. </p>



<p>And fans are loving it! So, is it curtains for <em>VPR</em>? </p>



<p>&#8220;Lisa is keeping an eye on the audience&#8217;s reaction,&#8221; a source explained. &#8220;<em>Villa</em> could replace <em>Rules</em> in the future, especially if VPR continues to sink and there aren&#8217;t as interesting storylines unfolding.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vanderpump-s-tricky-past">Vanderpump&#8217;s Tricky Past </h2>



<p>But isn&#8217;t the first time fans thought the show would be gone for good. </p>



<p>Reality TV stars are often encouraged to engage in outrageous behavior, but there&#8217;s a fine line between actions that are scandalously amusing from a distance, and those that are unacceptable under any circumstances.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s a lesson that the cast of <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>has learned the hard way over the years.</p>

<p>Remember the summer of 2020?</p>



<p>Longtime cast members <a href="/2020/06/stassi-schroeder-and-kristen-doute-fired-from-vanderpump-rules-a/">Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute were fired</a> from the show after it was revealed that they had engaged in racially motivated harassment of a Black co-star named Faith Stowers.</p>



<p>Newcomers Max Boyen and Brett Ciprioni were let go the same day after old, racist tweets of theirs were discovered.</p>



<p>Just as the dust began to settle from those scandals, the show was hit with yet another major casting shakeup.</p>



<p>Controversial series original <a href="/2020/12/jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/">Jax Taylor was fired from </a><em><a href="/2020/12/jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-fired-from-vanderpump-rules/" rel="nofollow">Vanderpump Rules</a>,</em> along with his wife, Brittany Cartwright.

<p>That&#8217;s when the original rumors that <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> would be canceled began to spread.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andy-cohen-on-vanderpump-rules-future">Andy Cohen On &#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217; Future</h2>



<p>Several sites reported at the time that Bravo execs decided to give <em>Vanderpump</em> the axe. They were just waiting until after the holidays to make the announcement.</p>



<p>But Andy Cohen was quick to deny the reports, and shared plans to bring back the remaining <em>Vanderpump</em> cast.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, they&#8217;ve got Lala [Kent], James [Kennedy], Scheana [Shay], Tom [Sandoval], Tom [Schwartz], Katie [Maloney], Arianna [Madix], the new people,&#8221; Cohen said on his radio show at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, that&#8217;s a solid cast. When that show&#8217;s going to start shooting again, I have no idea, but I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;m excited for there to be a shift also.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, that was before. Now we know not only was the show not canceled, but it was on the precipice of it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/ariana-madix-vs-tom-sandoval-exes-clash-in-explosive-vanderpump-rules-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest season ever</a>. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-12-at-2.02.30%E2%80%AFPM-1024x673.png" alt="Ariana Madix speaks to a producer" class="wp-image-495561"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ariana Madix speaks to a producer in this scene from Vanderpump Rules.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-vanderpump-rules-managed-to-escape-cancellation-before-now">How Vanderpump Rules Managed To Escape Cancellation Before Now</h2>



<p>One word: Scandoval. </p>



<p>By now, we all know the tale: <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/tom-sandoval-returns-to-vanderpump-rules-causes-all-sorts-of-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Sandoval</a> had an affair with&nbsp;Rachel Leviss&nbsp;that shocked the world.</p>



<p>A world that, up until that point, seemed to have given up on the show. </p>



<p>But Scandoval saved the show from cancelation, renewing interest in the Bravo staple that was ready to conclude after season 10. </p>



<p>But now, Rachel is off the show, Ariana and Tom&#8217;s feuding is feeling tired, and the scandalous former co-stars have moved on to yet another Vanderpump spin-off that feels more interesting. </p>



<p>Bottom line: with fresh and old faces on new shows with excited audiences, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> days feel numbered. </p>



<p>Will it return for another season? Possibly. But it may well be the show&#8217;s last.</p>

<p>Brittany Cartwright moved on very quickly after her split from Jax Taylor!</p>



<p>A source close to the situation revealed that Brittany hooked up with Jax&#8217;s friend right after their split, according to a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/10/07/celebrity-news/brittany-cartwright-started-secretly-hooking-up-with-jax-taylors-pal-julian-sensley-shortly-after-separation/">report</a> from <em>Page Six. </em></p>



<p>The insider revealed that shortly after Jax and Brittany broke up in February, the <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>star began a &#8220;casual&#8221; fling with Julian Sensley. Julian is a basketball player-turned-actor, who was a bouncer at the bar TomTom.</p>



<p>After Brittany and Jax separated, the reality star reportedly began a short, &#8220;casual&#8221; physical relationship with Julian. The insider said that Brittany&#8217;s estranged husband &#8220;went beserk,&#8221; when he heard about the fling.</p>

<p>The source also admitted that Brittany&#8217;s romance with Julian was part of Jax&#8217;s reason for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking mental health treatment</a> in July 2024. </p>



<p>Julian is now engaged, and he shares a child with his fiancée. The pair were reportedly &#8220;off and on.&#8221; During the relationship with Brittany, they were &#8220;going through a rough patch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brittany did reveal that they had said that they could see other people in a June <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIrDEpphC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with <em>E! News</em>. &#8220;We’ve said going into this that we could test the waters with other people if we wanted to,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The drama surrounding the relationship will reportedly take part in <em>The Valley </em>season 2. The reality show&#8217;s next season is expected to air in 2025. </p>



<p>Julian also has an older child. An older rumor also romantically linked him to fellow <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>star Lala Kent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-did-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-break-up">When Did Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor Break Up?</h2>



<p>Brittany and Jax have been married since June 2019. They have one child together: <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-welcome-first-child-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cruz Michael Cauchi</a>. The pair seem dedicated to co-parenting Cruz since their split.</p>



<p>Jax had previously cheated on his wife, but it&#8217;s not clear if that played a part in the split.</p>



<p>They separated in February 2024. Brittany announced the separation on their podcast <em>When Reality Hits</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Jax and I are taking time apart and I made the decision to move into another home to take some space for the sake of my mental health.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since the split, there have been a few times that people believed that they had reunited. The pair have remained separated since the split. In June, Brittany assured fans that they were still separated in the above-mentioned<em> </em>interview with <em>E! </em>She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially filed for divorce </a>in August 2024. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-have-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-said-about-the-split">What Have Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor Said About the Split?</h2>



<p>After filing for divorce, Brittany <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/brittany-cartwright-breaks-silence-on-jax-taylor-divorce-breaks-all-the-way-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened up about how difficult</a> the process has been on the <em>When Reality Hits </em>podcast. Still, she said that she was looking forward to the future.</p>



<p>&#8220;My decision to file wasn’t made lightly or quickly. It’s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I gained enough courage and strength to do what’s best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>While a divorce is undoubtedly difficult, Jax admitted that he felt that it was the right decision. He showed support for his ex on a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-breaks-silence-on-brittany-cartwright-divorce-she-made-the-right-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate episode</a> of the podcast. &#8220;Brittany did file for divorce. I understand why she did and I agree that this is the right decision for our family,&#8221; he explained. </p>



<p>Jax seemed to own up to his own shortcomings, as he continued. &#8220;I don’t blame her at all. I mean, I can’t believe she’s been with me this long as it is. That we stayed, to be honest,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Jax Taylor is not making any excuses.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s not shirking any responsibility and he&#8217;s not point fingers &#8212; unless you count the ones he has placed in his own direction.</p>



<p>On the latest edition of his podcast, the Bravo personality spoke out for the first time about his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">divorce from Brittany Cartwright</a> after five years of marriage, surprising some listeners with the insight he had to share.</p>

<p>“I know that Brittany addressed our current situation on last week’s podcast. It’s been a really, really rough week. Anyone that has gone through a divorce will understand how difficult this is,” Taylor said. </p>



<p>“Brittany did file for divorce. I understand why she did and I agree that this is the right decision for our family.”</p>



<p>Continued the Vanderpump Rules and The Valley cast member, referencing his wife:</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame her at all. I mean, I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s been with me this long as it is. That we stayed, to be honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taylor previously cheated on Cartwright, although it is not believed that he did so again recently or that infidelity played a role in their divorce.</p>



<p>Last week, Brittany co-hosted this same podcast <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/brittany-cartwright-breaks-silence-on-jax-taylor-divorce-breaks-all-the-way-down/">and said of the split</a>, which will play out on The Valley Season 2:</p>



<p>“I never imagined I’d go through something so personal and painful while having the world watch. I’m not saying this for anyone to feel badly, but I know that this is the life I chose and I’m so fortunate in many ways. I always want to be real with y’all.”</p>

<p>Taylor and Cartwright are parents of a three-year old son named Cruz.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll always love and care for Brittany. She’s the mother of my beautiful son,&#8221; Jax said on September 6.</p>



<p>&#8220;All I want for us is to be amicable and even hopefully really, really good friends. One day. I know I’m an amazing father and I know that I will make an excellent ex-husband.”</p>



<p>Taylor also addressed his recent stay in a mental health facility, which resulted in the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-reveals-bipolar-disorder-ptsd-diagnoses-amid-divorce-filing/">diagnosis of PTSD and bipolar disorder</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got there and I f-cking hated it,&#8221; Taylor told fans.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then I loved it. I didn&#8217;t want to f-cking leave. I really, really didn&#8217;t. I was so sad leaving. I was crying, I was like, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to go.&#8217; I was scared to leave those front doors because I got up in the morning, had my breakfast, structure, every day. I was reading.&#8221;</p>



<p>He concluded on this topic:</p>



<p>&#8220;I now have a little bit better understanding of my mental health struggles. I’ve been put on some serious medication that’s actually been helping me out a lot. </p>



<p>&#8220;In time, I’ll definitely speak more about it openly, but right now I kind of just need to deal with this process.”&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll give the final word here to Cartwright, who said on her August 30 podcast:</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken me many, many years to get to this point where I&#8217;ve gained enough courage to strength to do what was best for me, get myself out of a toxic relationship and ultimately see my worth.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been very difficult, but I&#8217;m stronger than ever and my motivation is my son, my Cruzy, who deserves a happy and healthy mommy.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jax-taylor-s-bipolar-confession-how-he-s-doing-now">Jax Taylor&#8217;s Bipolar Confession: How He&#8217;s Doing Now</h2>



<p>“A little over a month ago, I checked into an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jax-taylor-in-patient-mental-health-treatment/">intensive inpatient treatment facility</a> scared of the unknown and what I would find out about myself,” Taylor wrote online alongside a black-and-white photo of himself reading. </p>



<p>“After many years of knowing something was wrong but not knowing exactly what it was, I recently learned that I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taylor rose to small screen fame as a cast member on Vanderpump Rules and now helps anchor spinoff The Valley.</p>



<p>He and Brittany Cartwright<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-divorce/"> just filed for divorce</a> after five years of marriage.</p>

<p>Continued Taylor on Monday:</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been a lot to process and an emotional time for me, however I’ve come home to my son with a new found sense of peace.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared for the future but my focus is just trying to be a better version of myself than I was yesterday. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mental health is a lifelong battle of not letting it control you but rather you learning to control it.&#8221;</p>
