<p>Back in 2023, the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry&#8217;s debut memoir </a>created quite a stir within royal circles.</p>



<p>The book, titled <em>Spare</em>, contained many surprising revelations about Harry&#8217;s childhood and early adult years.</p>



<p>But it was not as critical of the other members of the royal family as some readers had expected and &#8212; in many cases &#8212; hoped.</p>



<p>Still, it seems that Harry&#8217;s brother and sister-in-law are so offended by the very existence of the book that they refuse to give it a chance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-and-william-reportedly-refuse-to-read-harry-s-book">Kate and William reportedly refuse to read Harry&#8217;s book</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-14522965/Royal-Family-thought-hearing-Prince-Harry-memoir-called-Spare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to</a> a recent biography of King Charles by royal expert Robert Hardman, neither Will nor Kate has read Harry&#8217;s memoir.</p>



<p>And it seems that neither of them has any intention of doing so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither of them read it. He is a grown-up, 40-year-old with the BBC app on his phone so he knows what it says,&#8221; one palace insider remarked. &#8220;But he has people like me to tell him what else he needs to know. We gave him the key points.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are spearheading a new campaign called Heads Together in partnership with inspiring charities, which aims to change the national conversation on mental wellbeing." class="wp-image-522982" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are spearheading a new campaign called Heads Together in partnership with inspiring charities, which aims to change the national conversation on mental wellbeing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Nicky J Sims/Getty Images for Royal Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the book may not have proved as damaging as some royals feared, it still generated a good deal of controversy at a very vulnerable time for the royals (it hit stores just months after the death of Queen Elizabeth II).</p>



<p>Hardman says the royals cryptically referred to bad press from overseas as &#8220;headwinds that we face from across the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was one way of describing an extraordinary 12-week run of non-stop disobliging headlines and combative allegations, all of them entirely beyond the control of the King and his staff. Storm-force gales might have been a better metaphor,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weathering-the-storm">Weathering the storm </h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1060279056-4-1024x685.jpg" alt="Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend a service marking the centenary of WW1 armistice at Westminster Abbey on November 11, 2018 in London, England.

<p>Hardman added that despite the challenges presented by the book&#8217;s publication, the lasting impact was negligible.</p>



<p>&#8220;That this should all be unfolding in the first phase of a new reign might once have been considered disastrous. However, there were two unexpected aspects to these ‘headwinds’ which would work in Charles III’s favour,&#8221; he explained, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;First, the constant diet of extraneous negativity, though awkward and at times embarrassing, made very little impact, according to polls, on public attitudes towards the monarchy. Second, it appeared to have no discernible impact on the King himself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, there are still concerns about Harry&#8217;s literary career, due mainly to the fact that &#8220;large chunks of more recent events&#8221; were left out of Spare.</p>



<p>&#8220;This suggested either a sequel or, perhaps, a memoir by Meghan in due course,&#8221; Hardman wrote.</p>



<p>There has been talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/meghan-markle-tell-all-memoir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan writing a memoir</a> of her own. But considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-hates-america-and-should-self-deport-conservative-group-argues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s book almost got him deported</a>, we&#8217;re guessing he&#8217;s content to focus on other pursuits for a while.</p>

<p>These days, Meghan Markle is making a name for herself as a lifestyle guru.</p>



<p>That means tirelessly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-finally-launches-as-ever-entire-inventory-sells-out-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoting her new brand, As Ever</a>, by whatever means necessary.</p>



<p>Given that the brand focuses on home life, it&#8217;s not surprising that Meghan&#8217;s two young children have cropped up in some of her promotional materials.</p>



<p>But while the move might make sense, it seems that Meg&#8217;s husband, Prince Harry, still isn&#8217;t happy about it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1177177288-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and their baby son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor at a meeting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Desmond &amp; Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation during their royal tour of South Africa on September 25, 2019 in Cape Town, South Africa.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-and-harry-clashing-over-kids-exposure">Meghan and Harry: Clashing over kids&#8217; exposure?</h2>



<p>While she keeps their faces concealed, Meghan has featured her kids in multiple social media posts designed to drum up publicity for her latest venture.</p>



<p>And one royal expert believes that Harry is not thrilled with that decision.</p>



<p>“Harry is probably not overly happy,” Matt Wilkinson, royal editor at <em>The Sun,</em> said on his podcast this week (via <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/06/royal-family/prince-harry-not-overly-happy-with-meghan-markle-using-kids-to-promote-brand-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>).</p>



<p>“My understanding of this is that up to a certain stage Harry would much rather his children were not seen,” Wilkinson added.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1024x683.jpg" alt='Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex speak on stage at the "Friends @ Home Event" at the Station Airport during day three of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 12, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany.' class="wp-image-522867" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1676592478-15-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex speak on stage at the &#8220;Friends @ Home Event&#8221; at the Station Airport during day three of the Invictus Games DÃ¼sseldorf 2023 on September 12, 2023 in Duesseldorf, Germany.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-harry-and-meghan-have-differing-views-on-privacy">Do Harry and Meghan have differing views on privacy?</h2>



<p>Indeed, Harry&#8217;s devotion to his kids&#8217; privacy is the stuff of legend.</p>



<p>That makes sense, of course, considering the ways in which his own childhood has destroyed by media intrusions.</p>

<p>And according to Wilkinson, Meghan is simply not as concerned with the issue.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want them to be [photographed]. He’s got this idea that if he takes them outside of Montecito, that there is a hoard of us out there trying to take photos of his kids,&#8221; Wilkinson explained.</p>



<p>“Meghan grew up in California, she once said she would like to have a more California-style lifestyle, take them down the beach, go out, do stuff,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>“She doesn’t want to hide them away.”</p>



<p>To be fair, Meghan is generally pretty protective of her kids&#8217; privacy.</p>

<p>But on the whole, she does seem less worried about the media than Harry is.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s a matter that they&#8217;ve discussed in detail, and despite Wilkinson&#8217;s speculation, we&#8217;re sure that Harry approved of the kids&#8217; involvement in Meghan&#8217;s recent social media posts.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s an issue that will only become more complex as the Archie and Lilibet get older.</p>



<p>And Harry and Meghan won&#8217;t be able to hide their faces forever.</p>

<p>Last week, we reported on the news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-defends-unthinkable-decision-to-step-down-from-charity-honoring-princess-diana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry has stepped down from Sentebale</a>, a charitable organization that he co-founded in 2006.</p>



<p>It was clear at the time that Harry had clashed with Sentebale CEO Sophie Chandauka.</p>



<p>Some of the details of the conflict remain mysterious, but the picture is coming into clearer focus every day.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1024x713.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-522156" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1080x752.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2-1200x836.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andy Stenning  &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sophie-allegedly-clashed-with-meghan-markle-at-a-photo-op">Sophie allegedly clashed with Meghan Markle at a photo-op</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/31/royal-family/video-of-meghan-markle-with-charity-chair-resurfaces-after-prince-harry-bullying-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, the trouble began when Meghan started &#8220;barking orders for [Sophie] to stand elsewhere in a photo-op.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meghan made a surprise appearance at the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in Wellington, Florida last summer, and Chandauka was forced to shuffle around to let her into a group photo. </p>



<p>In reality, Meghan didn&#8217;t &#8220;bark orders.&#8221; She merely asked Sophie, “You want to come over here?” Still the awkward clip quickly went viral.</p>



<p>“We would have been really excited had we known ahead of time [Meghan was coming], but we didn’t,” Sophie said in a new interview with <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/prince-harry-accused-of-harassment-and-bullying-at-scale-by-sentebale-chair-sophie-chandauka-13338558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky News</a>.</p>



<p>“And so the choreography went badly on stage because we had too many people on stage,” she explained. </p>



<p>“The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the Duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me.”</p>

<p>Sophie says that Harry asked her to issue a statement “in support” of Meghan amid the controversy. She refused.</p>



<p>“Not because I didn’t care about the Duchess, but because I knew what would happen if I did so, number one,” she explained. “And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.”</p>



<p>Sophie claims that Harry then sent her an even harsher note, in which he asked her to “explain herself.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I knew what would happen if I did so, number one. And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes,” she said, going on to accuse Harry of “harassment and bullying.”</p>

<p>According to royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams, that incident was the beginning of the end for Sentebale.</p>



<p>In a new interview with the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14553837/awkward-video-meghan-harry-sentebale.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, Fitzwilliams claims that “the ferocious feud that has split Sentebale” will be “a bitter blow to [Harry].”</p>



<p>Harry announced his departure from Sentebale last week in a sternly worded statement.</p>



<p>“What’s transpired is unthinkable,” he wrote. “It is devastating that the relationship between the charity’s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, it sounds like there&#8217;s more drama to come from this situation.</p>

<p>Prince Harry finds himself at the center of yet another controversy this week.</p>



<p>But in a refreshing change of pace, this one has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/gwyneth-paltrow-seems-to-mock-meghan-markle-in-shady-instagram-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle&#8217;s new career as a lifestyle influencer</a>.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, Harry has been active in humanitarian work throughout his adult life.</p>



<p>One of his earliest projects is the Sentebale organization, which Harry founded way back in 2006 in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-surprising-decision">Harry&#8217;s surprising decision</h2>



<p>And now, in a shocking turn of events, Harry and co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho have announced that they will both be stepping down from the organization.</p>



<p>The duo made their decision clear in a statement issued to the <em><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-harry-resign-charity-sentable-dps2tkq5n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London Times</a></em>. Harry said that he&#8217;s &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; to step away from the organization that&#8217;s meant so much to him, but says the current situation is “untenable situation” due to a conflict with Senetable chairwoman Dr. Sophie Chandauka and the board of trustees.</p>



<p>“What’s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this,&#8221; said Harry and Seeiso in a joint statement.</p>

<p>“With heavy hearts, we have resigned for our roles as patrons of the organization until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees,” they continued.</p>



<p>“It is devastating that the relationship between the charity’s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair.”</p>



<p>Harry and Seeiso explained that they will not cut ties with the charity entirely, explaining, “Although we may no longer be patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care.”</p>



<p>Sentebale, which helps children and adolescents struggling to come to terms with their HIV and AIDS diagnoses says it has not yet received formal “resignations from the royal patrons.&#8221;</p>

<p>“We are pleased to confirm the restructuring of our board on March 25, 2025, to introduce experts with the capabilities and networks to accelerate Sentebale’s transformation agenda as announced last year,” a rep for the organization told <em><a href="https://people.com/prince-harry-devastated-as-he-quits-african-charity-sentebale-founded-princess-diana-honor-11703464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>.</p>



<p>Details are scarce at the moment, and it sounds like distancing himself from the situation is the right call for Harry&#8217;s career and reputation.</p>



<p>Still, this is the latest in a long line of minor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-urged-to-leave-us-after-judge-orders-release-of-immigration-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR setbacks for Harry and Meghan</a>, and you can be sure that the Sussexes&#8217; harshest critics will seize on this opportunity to sling mud at the couple.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Well, apparently the fact that so many of them have cut ties with the Duke of Sussex tells us just about everything we need to know.</p>



<p>Yes, according to royal journalist Tom Quinn, the rumors of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/meghan-markle-prince-harry-losing-friends-in-la-amid-latest-pr-crises-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry getting dumped by his pals</a> are 100 percent true.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-turned-harry-woke-former-friends-allege">Meghan turned Harry &#8216;woke,&#8217; former friends allege</h2>



<p>These days, Quinn is promoting a new book titled <em>Yes Ma’am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants</em>. And he may have ruffled some feathers while promoting the tome in a new interview with Fox News.</p>



<p>“Meghan was blamed for … making Harry ‘too woke,’” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-blamed-by-prince-harrys-pals-making-him-too-woke-royal-exit-author" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quinn told the outlet</a> this week. </p>



<p>“One of Harry’s best friends said, ‘I can’t understand what Harry sees in her. She’s a tree hugger. She’s so woke.’ For Harry’s traditional friends, being woke was not a good thing,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;But I think Harry was, in a way, entranced by the fact that Meghan was able to offer him an alternative world from the one he’d always known.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-harry-s-friends">The beginning of the end for Harry&#8217;s friends</h2>



<p>Quinn went on to reveal that there was a specific incident that led to widespread discouragement among Harry&#8217;s closest friends.</p>



<p>“There’s a famous occasion where Meghan went with Harry and some of his friends from school and from the army — she went on a pheasant shoot at Sandringham, the royal family’s country home,” Quinn explained.</p>



<p>“She hated it because all of Harry’s friends were making the sorts of jokes that suggested they disliked everything to do with ‘woke.’ They made rude comments about tree-huggers. They just don’t like that kind of thing because, to a large extent, it’s seen as left-wing. They just didn’t like it.”</p>



<p>But while Harry&#8217;s friends seem to have assumed that he shifted his political beliefs in order to appease Meghan, Quinn notes that he may have found <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her views and beliefs</a> genuinely compelling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-new-beliefs">Harry&#8217;s new beliefs</h2>



<p>“With Meghan, [Harry] shifted across,” Quinn said. “He became much more sympathetic as she is about wanting to do good in the world. </p>



<p>&#8220;The idea of Harry being worried about those things before Meghan — it would never have occurred to him. I think Meghan really took him away from that [old] world, and they didn’t like that.”</p>



<p>Quinn&#8217;s book is primarily about the palace staff who serve the royals, so it should come as no surprise that one of the hottest Harry takes came from an employee.</p>

<p>“That terrible modern word ‘woke’ has often been used, and although I don’t like it, I can see why it is applied to Harry — he did become far more concerned about social issues and the rights of minorities than he’d ever been before Meghan’s arrival,” a former palace aide told Quinn.</p>



<p>The source added that Harry went from “being pretty easygoing” to being “more disgruntled” after he met Meghan.</p>



<p>Well, if he&#8217;s disgruntled, he&#8217;s certainly hiding it well. In most pics with Meghan, Harry looks to be happier than ever.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-urged-to-leave-us-after-judge-orders-release-of-immigration-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry deportation drama</a> continued this week, as conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation successfully pushed for the release of documents related to Harry&#8217;s visa.</p>
</p>
<p>But as many legal experts predicted, the docs were heavily redacted, and there was nothing in them that might lead to Harry being expelled from the US.</p>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, political opponents of the Duke of Sussex still want him out of the country.</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>And now that they can&#8217;t force the courts to do it (frankly, it was dumb that they ever thought they&#8217;d be able to), the haters are trying a more direct approach:</p>
</p>
<p>They&#8217;re directly encouraging Harry to uproot his family and move them halfway across the world as punishment for partying in his twenties.</p>
</p>
<p>(The Heritage group claims that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/its-meghan-markles-fault-that-prince-harry-might-get-deported-for-doing-drugs-royal-expert-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry should be deported for doing drugs</a> during a trip to the US many years ago, a lapse in judgment that he failed to disclose in his visa application.)</p>
</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heritage-foundation-lawyer-urges-harry-to-return-to-uk">Heritage Foundation lawyer urges Harry to return to UK</h2>
</p>
<p>Samuel Dewey, a lawyer for the Heritage Foundation, made his case against Harry in a new interview with the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14516167/Heritage-foundation-prince-harry-visa-lawsuit-hates-america-meghan-markle.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>.</p>

</p>
<p>He argued that Harry &#8220;really ought to go&#8221; due to his criticism of President Donald Trump.</p>
</p>
<p>Harry actually has <em>not</em> been a terribly vocal critic of the Trump administration, but Dewey points to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/prince-harry-shades-tf-out-of-donald-trump-hes-weak-and-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments the Duke made</a> about &#8220;weak moral character in the world&#8221; and alleges the remark was referring to the president.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in a country he clearly hates. He&#8217;s clearly furious at the American voters and attacking them for the result of the 2024 election. Harry should just go home,&#8221; Dewey added.</p>
</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dewey-says-harry-lied-about-past-drug-use-on-visa-application">Dewey says Harry lied about past drug use on visa application</h2>
</p>
<p>Despite recent free speech crackdowns in the US, it still remains very unlikely that a figure as prominent as Prince Harry would be deported for criticizing the president. Thus, the Heritage group has focused their argument on the claim that Harry lied about his past drug use when applying for a visa.</p>
</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1024x713.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-521782" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1080x752.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1200x836.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></p>

</p>
<p>&#8220;If Harry lied he should be prosecuted and deported if necessary,&#8221; says Dewey.</p>
</p>
<p>The lawyer goes on to claim that Harry received special treatment, a fact that he claims is evidenced by discrepancies in files held by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;d say I used drugs or was in on a diplomatic visa that would be in the DHS files,&#8221; Dewey claims.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you wouldn&#8217;t have this situation where the judge says I don&#8217;t have the full story. That&#8217;s what we read from these documents.&#8221;</p>

</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>This latest push to kick Harry out of the US comes on the heels of months of efforts to have his files made public.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;We would strongly urge President Trump and the new administration to release the records to the American people so they judge for themselves without relying on the interpretation of the Biden administration,&#8221; Heritage director Nile Gardiner wrote in a message to the White House.</p>
</p>
<p>In the end, those docs were as disappointing as the much-vaunted <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/19/jfk-files-release-what-we-learned-updates/82542231007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JFK files</a>, but the Heritage Foundation remains optimistic:</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing changes the big picture and I remain positive we will see Prince Harry&#8217;s full immigration records,&#8221; Gardiner added.</p>
</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p></p>

<p>In his 2023 memoir, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/prince-harry-cops-to-tender-penis-while-attending-brothers-iconic-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spare</a></em>, Prince Harry revealed that he struggled with substance abuse in his younger years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the sort of revelation that&#8217;s not uncommon in celebrity autobiographies, but in Harry&#8217;s case, the confession could come with some unpleasant legal consequences.</p>
<p>Some of the drug use Harry talked about took place while he was visiting the US. And now, political enemies of the Duke of Sussex would like to see him kicked out of the country as a result.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-major-legal-setback-for-harry">A major legal setback for Harry?</h2>
<p>Last year, conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/its-meghan-markles-fault-that-prince-harry-might-get-deported-for-doing-drugs-royal-expert-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanding the release of Harry&#8217;s visa application</a>, as well as other documents related to his migration to the US.</p>
<p>Now, a judge has ruled in the foundation&#8217;s favor and ordered that Harry&#8217;s files must be released by the end of today.</p>
<p>What might that mean for Harry and his family? Well, it&#8217;s possible that there will be no consequences at all.</p>
<p>But as many have pointed out, the Trump administration prides itself on its aggressive approach to deportation, and making an example out of a high-profile political opponent like Harry might be a tempting prospect for the White House.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-harry-us-immigration-files-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a> legal contributor Jessica Levinson said today.</p>
<p>And according to a new report from the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14510253/prince-harry-visa-documents-unsealed-duke-papers-row-drug-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, at least one high-profile UK politician has sided with the Heritage Foundation by &#8220;urging&#8221; to self-deport.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Harry is here illegally it would be hypocritical for him to get special treatment given the mass deportations occurring now,&#8221; says Chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, Greg Swenson</p>
<p>&#8220;Smartest thing for Harry would be to leave the US, avoid the proceedings and leave voluntarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the Trump White House might protect Harry&#8217;s right to remain in the US, Swenson replied, &#8220;It probably won&#8217;t rank high enough as an issue. I don&#8217;t think he will intervene.&#8221;</p>

<p>Royal journalist Richard Fitzwilliams added that if Trump intervenes at all, it probably won&#8217;t be on Harry&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Fitzwilliams told <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/royal/prince-harry-leave-us-bombshell-documents-royal-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GB News</a>: &#8220;We know what the Sussexes think politically. They are strongly anti-Trump.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-confession">Harry&#8217;s confession</h2>
<p>In his book, Harry admitted to using cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, and other illicit substances while spending time in the US as a young man.</p>
<p>“Of course I had been taking cocaine at that time. At someone’s house, during a hunting weekend, I was offered a line, and since then I had consumed some more,” Harry wrote in one version of his book (per CBS News).</p>
<p>“It wasn’t very fun, and it didn’t make me feel especially happy as seemed to happen to others, but it did make me feel different, and that was my main objective. To feel. To be different.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/courteney-cox-prince-harry-tripped-on-mushrooms-at-my-house-and-he-did-not-have-my-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry also admitted to taking mushrooms</a> during a party at the home of actress Courteney Cox.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that his past actions will force Harry to return to the UK, but you can bet that he and wife Meghan Markle are feeling a bit anxious today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p></p>

<p>Kate Middleton doesn&#8217;t want her children to end up like Prince Harry.</p>
<p>Prince Harry has many good qualities. He is charitable, kind-hearted, has a strong sense of duty, and puts <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-corrects-mindy-kaling-on-how-to-address-her-during-awkward-with-love-meghan-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his wife</a> and children before all else.</p>
<p>But, in one respect, Kate doesn&#8217;t want George, or especially Charlotte or Louis, to be like their uncle.</p>
<p>To that end, a new report claims, Kate is working to make certain that they do not walk in Harry&#8217;s footsteps.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-lessons-has-kate-middleton-learned-from-what-happened-to-prince-harry">What lessons has Kate Middleton learned from what happened to Prince Harry?</h2>
<p>According to a new report by <em><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/kate-middleton-mission-stop-boys-turning-out-like-royal-exile-prince-harry-doesnt-want-history-repeating-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a></em>, Kate Middleton is using her background as a wealthy commoner now that she&#8217;s a royal parent.</p>
<p>Kate married into royalty. Her hope is that her own experiences will allow her to safeguard her children from walking down Prince Harry&#8217;s path.</p>
<p>Prince George is 11. Princess Charlotte is 9. Prince Louis is 7. Kate hopes that all three will grow up with a strong sense of duty, just like Harry. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1024x710.jpg" alt="Prince Harry on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-520638" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-2048x1420.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-960x665.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, Founder and Patron of the Invictus Games Foundation delivers remarks at the Closing Ceremonies of the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images for Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the report says that she hopes that they will not grow up under the burden of the traditional constraints that come with the monarchy.</p>
<p>Setting that boundary would be much more of a challenge for Prince William. He has only ever known royal life &#8212; and the expectation that he will someday become king <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/king-charles-accused-of-creating-toxic-work-environment-amid-cancer-battle-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like his father</a>.</p>
<p>Though Kate grew up in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kate-middleton-parents-net-worth-family-business-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealthy family</a>, they were still not part of the anachronistic institution into which she has married. That can make a tremendous difference when it comes to raising three royal children to </p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bestselling memoir, <em>Spare</em></a>, Prince Harry writes about feeling like a backup heir to his brother &#8212; and Kate Middleton clearly knows that.</p>
<p>According to the report&#8217;s inside source: &#8220;Although the royal couple embraces tradition, they aren&#8217;t afraid to adapt and step away from strict protocols when the situation calls for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insider continued: &#8220;William and Kate are dedicated to their children and prioritize family above all else.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="718" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1024x718.jpg" alt="Prince Harry on November 17, 2024." class="wp-image-520640" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-768x538.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-2048x1436.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-960x673.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1080x757.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_02-1200x841.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry during a TV interview during pre-game festivities prior to the start of the 2024 Grey Cup at BC Place on November 17, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Rich Lam/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Their approach highlights what’s truly important,&#8221; the source alleged. </p>
<p>The insider continued: &#8220;Giving the kids the freedom to explore their interests and have a childhood that feels as normal as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The source then noted: &#8220;A key part of Kate&#8217;s parenting philosophy is ensuring that Prince George, despite being the heir, doesn’t overshadow his siblings.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-report-leaves-something-out">That report leaves something out</h2>
<p>One of the biggest issues for Prince Harry came in adulthood, when he had his own wife and child. </p>
<p>British tabloids penned numerous hate pieces against Meghan Markle (as they continue to do), while he felt like the royal firm offered her up without extending the sorts of pressures and protections that William and Kate received.</p>
<p>We of course cannot verify if any part of <em>RadarOnline</em>&#8216;s report is true. But we hope that William and Kate will ensure that their own children&#8217;s spouses do not become such easy targets.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is in the midst of what she hopes will be a comeback of sorts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that Meghan&#8217;s career is dead, but she and husband Prince Harry are likely not where they thought they would be five years after moving to America.</p>
<p>In 2024, among other setbacks, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-ruined-her-spotify-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s podcast was canceled</a>, and polls indicated that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/meghan-markle-vs-kate-middleton-who-is-the-most-popular-royal-of-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less popular</a> than she had been in years past.</p>
<p>Now, the Duchess of Sussex is hoping that a new Netflix series and lifestyle brand can bring her back to the top. But she&#8217;s already running into roadblocks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-markle-prepares-to-enter-new-stage-of-her-career">Meghan Markle prepares to enter new stage of her career</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Meghan shared some behind-the-scenes footage from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-will-not-watch-meghan-markles-new-netflix-series-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her new show, <em>With Love, Meghan</em></a>.</p>
<p>The clip itself is somewhat unremarkable. We see Meghan dancing, bonding with the crew, and enjoying lighthearted moments between takes.</p>
<p>The moment that&#8217;s likely to generate the most conversation is the very brief cameo from Prince Harry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six more days until our show launches on @netflix! Celebrating the crew and everyone who helped make this happen! The countdown begins,&#8221; Meghan captioned the clip.</p>
<p>Fans were excited to see a conformation that the show will premiere next week after being <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markles-new-netflix-series-postponed-amid-la-wildfires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by the California wildfires</a>.</p>
<p>But according to a new report from the <em><a href="http://dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14440915/Meghan-posts-quickly-deletes-scenes-footage-new-Netflix-series-featuring-husband-Prince-Harry-dance-moves.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, &#8220;the footage was mysteriously deleted&#8221; shortly after it went live.</p>

<p>The clip was later reposted, but Meghan&#8217;s followers might still be feeling confused about why it was taken down.</p>
<p>Did the original post include something that Meghan and Harry decided to keep to themselves?</p>
<p>After all, the show is filmed in their home, so maybe they decided to take steps to protect their privacy. </p>
<p>Of course, there have been rumors that the house on camera does not really belong to Meghan and Harry, so you can bet that anti-Sussex conspiracy theorists will allege that the deletion had to do with that alleged deception.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-truth-of-the-matter">The truth of the matter</h2>
<p>We may not know exactly why Meghan deleted the post, but two things are certain:</p>
<p>One, it was certainly an intentional move, as Meghan is famously fastidious about her career and public image.</p>
<p>And two, the reasoning behind the decision was probably quite boring and scandal-free.</p>

<p>She may have done so at the behest of a PR consultant or someone else who noticed a glitch in the original video.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is a crucial time for the duchess, and she&#8217;s likely well aware that she can&#8217;t affort any setbacks.</p>
<p>Already, Meghan has run into trademarking issues with her lifestyle brand and was forced to delay the launch.</p>
<p>These matters can probably be resolved in court with relative ease, but at this stage in her career, Meghan probably doesn&#8217;t want to add to the impression that her enviable life is anything less than flawless.</p>

<p>We have new insight into a feud that continues to rock a nation.</p>
<p>As nearly every celebrity gossip follower knows at this point, the world famous brothers have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/prince-william-prince-harry-funeral-face-off/">not gotten along in quite awhile</a>.</p>
<p>From what we can gather, there&#8217;s been no contact between the siblings in many months.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="709" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1024x709.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520022" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-2048x1418.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-960x665.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1080x748.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1243351922-1200x831.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William and Prince Harry arrive for the state funeral and burial of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey on September 19, 2022 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Hannah McKay- WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, meanwhile, Prince Harry and Prince William’s former royal aide, Jason Knauf, is opening up about his rare insider perspective on the brothers’ years-long rift.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very sad, really.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye,” Knauf &#8212; who worked as a communication secretary for the brothers and their wives &#8212; said during a interview with 60 Minutes Australia on Sunday, February 23. </p>
<p>“But [William]’s chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same.”</p>

<p>Neither William nor Harry has said anything to the press about their relationship.</p>
<p>But Knauf admits &#8220;it’s been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them.”</p>
<p>Jason worked as a communications secretary to William and his wife, Princess Kate Middleton, as well as to Harry and <em>his</em> wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a>&#8230; before transitioning to the role of chief executive of William and Kate’s Royal Foundation in March 2019. </p>
<p>He knows both brothers rather well.</p>
<p>Although he stepped down from the royal household at the end of 2021, Knauf remains on the board of trustees for Prince William’s Earthshot Prize.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512900" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2182386712-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William attends Earthshot+ at Portside Tower on November 5, 2024 in Cape Town, South Africa. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Aaron Chown &#8211; Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to Harry and Markle, Jason said he worked “closely” with the former Royals and had “lots of great times.” He even referred to their 2018 wedding as an “amazing, magical experience.”</p>
<p>At some point, of course, Prince William will become king.</p>
<p>Is it possible such a monumental occasion will bring the siblings back together?</p>
<p>&#8220;I can’t speculate about the future. They achieved a lot together, and none of that can ever be taken away,&#8221; Knauf simply said on this topic.</p>
<p>No, but William was allegedly not very receptive to his loved one dating Markle&#8230; which kicked off their feud back in 2018.</p>

<p>In the pages of his recent biography, Harry even accused William of physically assaulting him during an argument over the actress in 2019. </p>
<p>The father of two explained he got into an argument with his brother after William called Meghan “difficult,” “rude” and “abrasive,&#8221; adding in the book:</p>
<p>“He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor,” Harry wrote about the altercation. </p>
<p>“I landed on the dog’s bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.”</p>

<p>Despite everything that the royal family has put Harry and his wife through, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/prince-harry-to-the-royal-family-take-me-back-i-can-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry is willing to help</a> during his father’s health crisis, as King Charles has cancer &#8212; that would include helping with royal duties in some capacity, if that’s what they need.</p>
<p>William, however, is staunchly against this.</p>
<p>“There’s one huge obstacle in Harry’s way, and that’s Prince William,” a royal expert, Kinsey Schofield, said in February.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/prince-william-blocking-prince-harry-royal-return-king-charles/">Harry will not be allowed to return</a> in any capacity if Prince William has any influence over the situation.”</p>
