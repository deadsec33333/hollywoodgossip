<p>The nominations for the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/who-will-host-the-oscars-2025/">2025 Academy Awards</a> were announced this morning.</p>



<p>And as usual, film fans are upset over a handful of shocking snubs.</p>



<p>For starters, Angelina Jolie did <em>not</em> receive a nomination for her role in <em>Maria</em>, a performance that many considered the finest of her career.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2169311741-1024x683.jpg" alt='Angelina Jolie attends a red carpet for "Maria" during the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 29, 2024 in Venice, Italy.

<p>And she wasn&#8217;t the only A-lister to receive a disappointing call from her agent today.</p>



<p>Denzel Washington was shut out for his work in <em>Gladiator II</em>, and Daniel Craig was snubbed for his revelatory performance in <em>Queer</em>.</p>



<p>But while some of Hollywood&#8217;s most revered talents might not be taking home any hardware this year, a slew of major talents are celebrating their first nominations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/demi-moore/page/2/">Demi Moore</a>, Kieran Culkin, Mikey Madison, Fernanda Torres, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/tom-cruise-new-girlfriend/">Monica Barbaro</a>, Zoe Saldaña, and Ariana Grande have all been recognized by the Academy for the very first time.</p>

<p>Alongside co-star Cynthia Erivo (who received her second nod today), Ariana was nominated for her bravura work in <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/wicked-movie-reviews-does-broadway-adaption-hit-the-right-notes/">Wicked</a></em>.</p>



<p>The film tied <em>The Brutalist</em> for this year&#8217;s second-most nominations with 10 each. The controversial cartel musical comedy <em>Emilia Perez l</em>ed the pack with 13 noms.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the rest of the major nominees. The Oscars will air on March 2, with Conan O&#8217;Brien hosting for the first time. </p>

<p>Denzel Washington will film his last movie one day. And he&#8217;s discussing some possibilities.</p>



<p>Though Denzel Washington can get a little ornery about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/denzel-washington-slams-meme-lovers-needs-to-lighten-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>, he is a legendary actor who has earned tremendous respect over his storied career.</p>



<p>He will also turn 70 years old in December. Some actors remain on screen until their 80s and beyond. Others choose retirement.</p>



<p><em>Gladiator II</em> won&#8217;t be Denzel Washington&#8217;s last movie. But what will?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-film-will-be-denzel-washington-s-last-movie">Which film will be Denzel Washington&#8217;s last movie?</h2>



<p>Back in August, Denzel Washington acknowledged that, at this stage in his monumental career, there aren&#8217;t many films left for him to do.</p>



<p>However, the Oscar winner has some candidates in mind for his last movie.</p>



<p>And, as if channeling the spirit of the (very much alive) <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/zendaya-tom-holland-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland</a>, he may have let a bit more slip out than he intended.</p>

<p>Amidst his press tour for <em>Gladiator II</em>, Denzel Washington spoke to Australia&#8217;s <em>Today</em>. You can watch that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM4wXMDBX68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> below.</p>



<p>He dished that Ryan Coogler is writing a role for him in the third <em>Black Panther</em> film.</p>



<p>The first to <em>Black Panther</em> films were incredible entries in the MCU. The prospect of a third featuring Denzel Washington and potentially being his final movie is </p>

<p>Denzel Washington is also part of a new Steve McQueen project. He is also working on a film adaptation of <em>Othello</em>.</p>



<p>“For me it’s about the filmmakers,&#8221; the actor explained. &#8220;Especially at this point in my career, I am only interested in working with the best.&#8221;</p>



<p>Denzel Washington admitted: “I don’t know how many more films I’m going to make. It’s probably not that many. I want to do things I haven’t done.”</p>

<p>“I played Othello at 22. I am about to play Othello at 70,” Denzel Washington commented. That production will co-star Jake Gyllenhaal.</p>



<p>“After that, I am playing Hannibal,&#8221; he noted. Washington refers there to the historical Carthaginian general, not to the iconic fictional antihero, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.</p>



<p>&#8220;After that, I’ve been talking to Steve McQueen about a film. After that, Ryan Coogler is writing a part for me in the next ‘Black Panther,'&#8221; he listed. Denzel Washington continued: &#8220;After that, I’m going to do the film ‘Othello,’ After that, I’m going to do King Lear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ultimately, Denzel Washington vowed: &#8220;After that, I’m going to retire.”</p>



<p>Incidentally, this is not the Oscar winner&#8217;s first connection to the <em>Black Panther</em> films. Prior to his tragic passing in 2020, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/08/chadwick-boseman-mourned-remember-by-stunned-friends-and-co-star/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the late Chadwick Boseman</a> revealed that Denzel Washington had paid for his acting classes one summer.</p>



<p>That lineup of films sounds like a fine send-off to a storied acting career. That said, perhaps the order will surprise even Denzel Washington. And maybe something else will crop up and turn out to be his <em>actual </em>last movie.</p>

<p>And that may be true.</p>
<p>But what about Ellen Pompeo?!?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="710" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg" alt="Ellen Pompeo in the Hospital" class="wp-image-409846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-735x679.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-335x310.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-347x321.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-520x481.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-in-the-hospital-640x592.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>On the latest episode of her podcast, the Grey&#8217;s Anatomy star sat down this week with former colleague Patrick Dempsey.</p>
<p>At one point, the conversation turned to a Season 12 episode of the ABC drama, which aired in February 2016 and which was directed by none other than Washington &#8212; as intense and as respected an actor as likely exists in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But if you thought Pompeo might be intimidated by his presence?</p>
<p>Well, she has a revealing story to tell&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>After praising Washington as a performer, Ellen admitted that she once she yelled an improvised line to another character during an emotional scene&#8230; and it didn&#8217;t go over well with the famous, one-time director.</p>
<p>&quot;I was like, &lsquo;Look at me when you apologize. Look at me,&#8217;&quot; Pompeo recalled yelling at the actor during the scene.</p>
<p>&quot;And that wasn&#8217;t in the dialogue,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>&quot;And Denzel went ham on my ass. He was like, &lsquo;I&#8217;m the director. Don&#8217;t you tell him what to do.&#8217;&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Once again, though, Pompeo made it clear in this retelling that she stood her ground against the actor. Big time.</p>
<p>&quot;I was like, &lsquo;Listen, motherf&#8211;ker, this is my show,&#8217;&quot; Ellen continued. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is my set. Who are you telling?&quot;</p>
<p>Clarifying laterr that she has the &quot;utmost respect for [Denzel] as an actor and director,&quot; Ellen said she was thrilled with the overall experience, but</p>
<p>&quot;Like, yo, we went at it one day.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="938" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-938x1024.jpg" alt="Meredith in Some Scrubs" class="wp-image-399592" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-938x1024.jpg 938w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-275x300.jpg 275w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-768x838.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-735x802.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-307x335.jpg 307w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-318x347.jpg 318w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-476x520.jpg 476w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-586x640.jpg 586w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-704x768.jpg 704w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-880x960.jpg 880w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs-990x1080.jpg 990w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/meredith-in-some-scrubs.jpg 1159w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;So, we didn&#8217;t get through it without a fight, but that&#8217;s actors for you,&quot; the actress told Dempsey.</p>
<p>&quot;Passionate and fiery and that&#8217;s where you get the magic, and that&#8217;s where you get the good stuff. So, it was an amazing experience, it really was.&quot;</p>
<p>It sounds incredible.</p>
<p>And how can one not respect Pompeo for standing her ground on the set of a show she has helped make iconic?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="914" height="954" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale.png" alt="Ellen Pompeo on the Finale" class="wp-image-344914" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale.png 914w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-287x300.png 287w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-768x802.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-735x767.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-321x335.png 321w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-332x347.png 332w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-498x520.png 498w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-613x640.png 613w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/ellen-pompeo-on-the-finale-736x768.png 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Recently, however, we heard another story about Pompeo&#8217;s power on set &#8212; and this one did not paint her in nearly as positive of a light.</p>
<p>Lynette Rice &#8212; who just released an unauthorized biography of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy titled&nbsp;<em>How to Save a Life: The Inside Story of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy &#8212;&nbsp;</em>spoke to E! News a few days ago and alleged that <a href="/2021/09/ellen-pompeo-accused-of-acting-like-a-diva-getting-greys-anatomy/">Pompeo once got a co-star fired</a>.</p>
<p>The author told E! that the Grey&#8217;s Anatomy cast often has felt the need to &quot;kiss the ring&quot; when it comes to Pompeo.</p>
<p>Translation? They often had to seek her permission to do almost anything on set.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Specifically, issues have arisen over when to take backstage pictures&#8230; who can take backstage pictures&#8230; and what then happens to these backstage pictures.</p>
<p>Talking to the aforementioned outlet, Rice told the story of an unnamed former cast member who ended up without a job because she defied Pompeo&#8217;s unwritten rules.</p>
<p>&quot;It was this weird thing that she was taking pictures behind-the-scenes.</p>
<p>&quot;But Ellen got to the point where it really became Ellen&#8217;s set, so you should really check in with mom, just let her know, &#8216;FYI, doing this, are you OK?&#8217; She didn&#8217;t do that.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As a result?</p>
<p>The anonymous series regular met her &quot;downfall,&quot; and ultimately was fired from Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, Rice says, adding as a major tease:</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;ve got to get the book to see who it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Pompeo has not yet commented on this allegation.</p>

<p>But <em>Radar</em> created quite the stir a couple days ago when it claimed such images were on the market and that the actor was on the verge of a <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2013/07/denzel-washington-cheating-scandal-photos-being-shopped/">divorce from Pauletta</a>, his wife of 30 years as a result.</p>
<p>The site alleges that it has seen these pictures and they depict the Oscar winner on a couch with an unidentified blonde, pulling her in for a kiss on the lips.</p>

            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>Pauletta&#8217;s supposed reaction to this news?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>&#8220;She moved to New York to contemplate if she&#8217;s ready to end the marriage for good,&#8221; an insider told <em>Star</em> magazine.</p>
<p>But this simply isn&#8217;t the case, a rep for the actor says, telling Gossip Cop after the allegations surfaced:</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not divorcing, not separating.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Ebony, Pauletta gushed over her husband of three decades.</p>
<p>“I live with this man,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I see the down part. I see the sad part. I see every part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has and knows he has stability in me as his wife. That’s what gives him strength, regardless if he misuses it… I can’t dwell on that. But I do know that gives him a great platform to go and fly.”</p>
