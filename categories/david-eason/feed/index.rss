<p>Jenelle Evans is preparing for the fight of her life.</p>



<p>Back in February of 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jenelle-evans-accuses-david-eason-of-being-a-pedophile-in-brand-new-recording/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle filed for divorce from David Eason</a>, and despite the fact that they&#8217;re both unemployed, it seems that neither party has gotten around to finalizing the split.</p>



<p>In fairness to Jenelle, that&#8217;s mostly on David, who took more than a year to respond to his estranged wife&#8217;s divorce and custody filings.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-david-eason-returns-fire-in-legal-battle-with-jenelle">David Eason returns fire in legal battle with Jenelle</h2>



<p>But this week, David finally found time in his busy schedule to respond to Jenelle&#8217;s complaint.</p>



<p>And as expected, he does <em>not</em> intend to make this process easy for his ex.</p>



<p>In court documents obtained by <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/03/27/exclusive-david-eason-responds-to-jenelle-evans-divorce-filing-demands-custody-child-support-of-daughter-ensley-more-full-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>, David requests full custody of Ensley, his seven-year-old daughter by Jenelle.</p>



<p>David admits that he hasn&#8217;t seen or spoken to Ensley, but he says that&#8217;s all Jenelle&#8217;s fault.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="Jenelle Evans on MTV." class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“[Jenelle] included the minor child, Ensley Eason; therefore, [David] is unable to contact the minor child…” his attorneys write in one recent filing. “…[doing this] made it impossible for [David] to contact [Jenelle] or the minor child….”</p>



<p>David goes on to claim that prior to the split, he was Ensley&#8217;s primary caretaker.</p>



<p>“[David] has been the primary caregiver of the minor child, Ensley, and the other minor children living in the marital home and was the one responsible for caring for the children, getting the children ready for school, feeding the children, completing homework, etc.,” his filing reads.</p>



<p>“[David] has been the one responsible for the minor child’s daily needs. David Eason was the one responsible for ensuring the minor child, Ensley, was dressed, fed, and ready for school and almost always transported the minor child, Ensley, to school and her extra-curricular activities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Given <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/david-eason-arrested-for-violating-restraining-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David&#8217;s long history of legal troubles</a> and substance abuse issues, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that he was the primary caretaker in that household &#8212; but then, it&#8217;s also impossible to imagine Jenelle acting like a responsible adult!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yes-david-is-also-after-jenelle-s-cash">Yes, David is also after Jenelle&#8217;s cash</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-04-at-9.59.59%E2%80%AFAM-1024x551.png" alt="Jenelle Evans offers her account of her two most recent breakups." class="wp-image-518453"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans offers her account of her two most recent breakups.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not surprisingly, David also requested that Jenelle pay him child support.</p>



<p>He asked the judge that “an order be entered herein awarding reasonable support, maintenance, and subsistence for the minor child of the parties to be paid or secured from the estate, earnings or other income of the Plaintiff, Jenelle Eason, as provided by law.”</p>



<p>“Jenelle Eason is an able-bodied female capable of providing support and maintenance for the use and benefit of [Ensley] when custody of [Ensley] is awarded to the defendant, David Eason,&#8221; his filing argues. </p>



<p>&#8220;David Eason will be entitled to support from the Plaintiff, Jenelle Eason, for the use and benefit of the minor child.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, in a rare display of decency, David <em>did</em> offer to split Ensley’s out-of-pocket medical expenses with Jenelle.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="563" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-1024x563.png" alt="Jenelle breaks down in tears on an episode of Teen Mom 2." class="wp-image-318527" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-1024x563.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-300x165.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-768x422.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-735x404.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-335x184.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-347x191.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-520x286.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-640x352.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-960x528.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad-1080x594.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/jenelle-evans-is-sad.png 1207w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle breaks down in tears on an episode of Teen Mom 2.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It is admitted that both parties have skills and trades which would allow them to earn an income sufficient to contribute to the support of the minor child,” his attorneys wrote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-tells-a-different-tale">Jenelle tells a different tale</h2>



<p>When Jenelle took the stand in an August 2024 court hearing.</p>



<p>“I’m looking to have sole and legal custody of Ensley and I think I’m a fit parent,” Jenelle said at the time.</p>



<p>“I think I’ve done most of the raising of Ensley, or all of the raising of Ensley since she’s been born, making sure she’s healthy and doing well in school, and making sure she’s at school on time, making sure she’s in extra-curricular activities. I pay attention to her mental health.”</p>



<p>David didn&#8217;t attend that hearing, but he&#8217;ll probably need to show up in court eventually if he wants to win custody of Ensley.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/david-eason-caught-on-camera-breaking-into-exs-home-trying-to-steal-all-kinds-of-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eason has a mile-long rap sheet </a>and a history of violent behavior, so it&#8217;s unlikely that he&#8217;ll be awarded full custody of a seven-year-old.</p>



<p>But the upcoming legal war is sure to make Jenelle&#8217;s life hell, and that&#8217;s probably reason enough for David.</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans is back in the news this week. And as usual, she&#8217;s making headlines for all the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jenelle-evans-dumps-august-keen-alleges-physical-abuse-infidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle&#8217;s messy breakup with August Keen</a> caught the attention of social media users (many of whom seemed to have forgotten that she existed).</p>



<p>And now, Jenelle&#8217;s feud with her 17-year-old former stepdaughter is stirring up even more controversy. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="Jenelle Evans on MTV." class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-gets-roasted">Jenelle Gets Roasted</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/02/05/david-easons-girlfriend-kenleigh-heatwole-exposes-jenelle-evans-threatening-message-to-former-stepdaughter-maryssa-youre-a-broken-girl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a> first reported, the trouble started when Maryssa posted her own take on the &#8220;You&#8217;re so funny&#8221; meme, in which social media users jokingly explain how their traumatic experiences shaped their sense of humor.</p>



<p>Maryssa&#8217;s version read, &#8220;Thank you, I grew up on &#8216;the land&#8217; with that one chick if ykyk.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Jenelle, Maryssa&#8217;s post was legitimately funny. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-04-at-9.59.59%E2%80%AFAM-1024x551.png" alt="Jenelle Evans offers her account of her two most recent breakups." class="wp-image-518453"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans offers her account of her two most recent breakups.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Getting roasted that thoroughly by someone who&#8217;s still in high school would be enough to drive anyone insane, and Jenelle is pretty much always one stubbed toe away from a total meltdown.</p>



<p>But on her own social media accounts, Evans initially played it (somewhat) cool:</p>



<p>“I’m not mad at her. She’s being influenced right now by different people around her to act the way she wants to. So I’m not going to post anything in retaliation,&#8221; Jenelle said during a livestream.</p>

<p>“I’ve been really nice to Maryssa. I didn’t know there was anything wrong between us….it’s whatever. Little kids are gonna talk s&#8211;t, ya know what I’m saying?” she continued.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the closest that Jenelle gets to taking the high road, and many of her followers were impressed by her newfound emotional maturity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, in private, Jenelle&#8217;s attitude toward the situation was considerably less chill.</p>



<p>Kenleigh Heatwole, who is the new girlfriend of Maryssa&#8217;s father (and Jenelle&#8217;s ex), David Eason, tweeted out what she claims are screenshots of messages that Maryssa received from Jenelle.</p>

<p>“You’ve got jokes? Me too. It’s sad you’re a broken girl and addicted to your dad’s love after what he did to you. I’ll pray for you,&#8221; Jenelle allegedly wrote to Maryssa.</p>



<p>“I did everything for you and you never even said thank you one time for me raising you, buying you everything and anything you’ve ever needed, and gave you a roof over your head,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want to match at this TikTok game we certainly can and I’ll tag you.”</p>



<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s not the kind of energy that a 33-year-old mom should be bringing to a conflict with a teenager. But it&#8217;s exactly what we expect from Jenelle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-messy-history">A Messy History</h2>



<p>As The Ashley points out, Jenelle kicked Maryssa out of the house at 16 when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jenelle-evans-accuses-david-eason-of-being-a-pedophile-in-brand-new-recording/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her marriage to David started going downhill</a>.</p>



<p>Evans later added insult to injury by slamming Maryssa during an Instagram Q&amp;A session.</p>



<p>“She refuses to talk to any of us,” Jenelle wrote in March of 2024. “She’s always been distant and I just don’t think I was ever looked at as her ‘stepmom.’ By the way I was disrespected so much by my ex [David], I feel like she wanted to feel the same way her dad did towards me. Very prideful!”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jenelle-evans-announces-move-to-las-vegas-says-she-lives-in-fear-of-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle moved to Las Vegas</a> shortly thereafter, but if the video about her boozy breakup with August is any indication, her life is still loaded with drama.</p>



<p>Evans was back in North Carolina this week for a court hearing pertaining to her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/david-eason-jenelle-evans-is-a-thief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restraining order against David</a>. But something tells us she probably didn&#8217;t take time to meet up with Maryssa for coffee.</p>

<p>David Eason has been arrested.</p>



<p>Yes, <strong><em>again.</em></strong></p>



<p>According to The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, a website always well-versed on all things Teen Mom, the estranged and often-violent husband of Jenelle Evans spent this <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/11/12/exclusive-former-teen-mom-star-david-eason-arrested-for-violating-jenelle-evans-restraining-order-against-him-trespassing-on-the-land/">past weekend in jail</a>.</p>

<p>Eason was reportedly taken into custody on Friday for violating a domestic violence restraining order that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-granted-restraining-order-against-violent-bigoted-husband/">Evans had placed against him</a>. David was <em>also</em> charged with trespassing. </p>



<p>Both charges are misdemeanors.</p>



<p>They relate to an incident previously reported on&#8230; back in October, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/david-eason-caught-on-camera-breaking-into-exs-home-trying-to-steal-all-kinds-of-stuff/">Eason was caught on security cameras</a> breaking on to the property he formerly shared with Evans in North Carolina.</p>



<p>David, his misguided girlfriend (Kenleigh Heatwole) and a few other individuals broke through a gate at the time and attempted to steal various tools, equipment, and motor vehicles from The Land.</p>

<p>Eason isn&#8217;t permitted on this property, as a result of the aforementioned protective order, and was actually escorted by a cop during the apparent break-in; the officer said he was present to supervise as Eason as retrieved his stuff from the shed.</p>



<p>“The deputy met the group and authorized them to use a SawZall tool to cut the lock of the gate leading onto the North Carolina property,” a local source told The Ashley last month. </p>



<p>“The deputy was under the impression that David was authorized to take the ATVs, motorcycles, dirt bikes, etc. but he was not.”</p>



<p>A county court clerk has confirmed that Eason was arrested on November 8 by the Pender County Sheriff’s Office and released on November 10 via a $1,000 bond set by the Magistrate to encompass both charges mentioned above.</p>

<p>Evans and Eason share one biological daughter and split up in March after many contentious years as husband and wife.</p>



<p>The latest drama between the spouses (excluding this arrest) centers on a troubling allegation leveled against her ex by Evans.</p>



<p>In testimony from a recent divorce hearing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jenelle-evans-accuses-david-eason-of-being-a-pedophile-in-brand-new-recording/">Evans said she came across</a> materials related to the “sexual exploitation of a minor&#8221; on David&#8217;s phone at some point in the past.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t elaborate. We aren&#8217;t privy to any other details in this case.</p>



<p>But Evans accuses Eason of not being fit to be around their child, Ensley, and asks that he is kept away from her until he undergoes a “psychological evaluation.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans went on to say that filed a police report back when she made this discovery &#8212; and then, on social media, the Teen Mom 2 alum wrote that she had reported what she had supposedly found to “police, FBI and custody court.”</p>



<p>We can’t say at the moment just where any kind of investigation stands in regard to this potentially ugly issue.</p>



<p>All we know right now is that Jenelle&#8217;s protective order expires next month and that Eason is due in court next month to answer for these new criminal charges.</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans leveled quite the serious allegation against David Eason.</p>



<p>As you likely know by now, Evans finally split from her violent husband back in March, stating at the time that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Eason was a deadbeat dad and a drunk</a>.</p>



<p>Now, however, via a recording from a recent divorce hearing during which Evans spoke in further detail about Eason and their marriage… the Teen Mom 2 alum has said something even more damning.</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="899" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1024x899.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513114" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1024x899.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-768x674.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-2048x1798.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-960x843.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1080x948.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-839957214-1200x1054.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason and Jenelle Evans attend the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (GETTY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, you can actually <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/11/08/exclusive-audio-hear-former-teen-mom-star-jenelle-evans-accuse-her-estranged-husband-david-eason-in-court-of-having-items-related-to-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor/">watch a tearful Evans testify</a> that she found memory cards from Eason&#8217;s phone that she says contained materials related to the “<strong>sexual exploitation of a minor</strong>.&#8221;</p>



<p>No other details are provided.</p>



<p>However, Evans accuses Eason of not being fit to be around their daughter, Ensley, and asks that he is kept away from her until he undergoes a “psychological evaluation.”</p>



<p>The judge <em>does</em> award Jenelle temporary legal and physical of the seven-year at the end of the hearing, although the allegations about Eason having child sex exploitation materials are not addressed.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="528" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-512971" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1024x528.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-300x155.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-768x396.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-960x495.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488-1080x557.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-next-947322488.webp 1117w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans rocks some glasses in this Teen Mom photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans went on to say that filed a police report back when she made this discovery &#8212; and then, on social media, Jenelle wrote that she had reported what she had supposedly found to “police, FBI and custody court.”</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say at the moment just where any kind of investigation stands.</p>



<p>In the wake of her divorce filing, Evans has moved to Las Vegas.</p>



<p>But the drama with Eason isn&#8217;t finished, as security cameras caught in a short while ago breaking into the property he formerly shared with his wife in North Carolina and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/david-eason-caught-on-camera-breaking-into-exs-home-trying-to-steal-all-kinds-of-stuff/">trying to take back some of his stuff</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-14-at-12.58.06%E2%80%AFPM-1024x737.png" alt="" class="wp-image-510954"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans does not look happy in this picture.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elsewhere, but relatedly it seems, Kenleigh Heatwole is dating Eason for some reason right now.</p>



<p>Shortly after Jenelle&#8217;s bombshell audio went public, she wrote the following on Instagram:</p>



<p>“Playing victim in situations they’ve created and then flip the story to manipulate people to think they are innocent.&#8221;</p>



<p>In another reel, Heatwole said she felt the same way as a person who thought:</p>



<p><em>Me trying to decide if I’m gonna stay calm or if I’m about to undo all my personal growth and say the most horrible things that will stay with them forever.</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="525" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510955" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-768x504.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans is on the phone in this Teen Mom scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Eason himself has not yet responded to his ex-wife&#8217;s latest accusations.</p>



<p>For her part, though, Kenleigh recently defended herself against those wondering why the heck she was dating some such as David Eason.</p>



<p>“He’s a lot sweeter than people portray him to be,” she insisted during an Instagram Live session.</p>

<p>The drama continues for Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>Over the past several days alone, we&#8217;ve reported that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-again/">Evans has been cut from Teen Mom</a> once again&#8230; and also that she has <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-sends-son-kaiser-to-live-with-grandmother-amid-domestic-violence-scandal-report/">sent one of her kids away</a> to live with his grandmother.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile, we appear to have evidence that her estranged husband, David Eason, broke into her home on Sunday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="945" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1024x945.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511687" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1024x945.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-300x277.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-768x709.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-960x886.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1080x997.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862-1200x1108.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-520070862.jpg 1903w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans and David Eason attends the 2016 MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros. Studios on April 9, 2016 in Burbank, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (GETTY)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on surveillance footage from Jenelle&#8217;s home in North Carolina, Eason, his girlfriend and three others cut off the locks to this property on Sunday night using bolt-cutters.</p>



<p>They proceeded to load up a number of motorcycles and other items from Jenelle&#8217;s garage and place them inside of a trailer.</p>



<p>TMZ has <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/10/22/jenelle-evans-claims-ex-david-eason-broke-into-property/">actually obtained footage</a> from this attempted robbery, which was brought to Jenelle&#8217;s attention thanks to an alert from her Ring camera system.</p>



<p>According to both TMZ and also The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, Eason brought a local deputy with him as an escort, who was under the impression that Eason was permitted to pick up these vehicles and items.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511719" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-839957216-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason and Jenelle Evans attend the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Evans is currently residing in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>As part of her divorce proceedings from Eason, she has taken out an order of protection against her often-violent ex.</p>



<p>The Ashley writes that Evans was “screaming via the Ring camera” at the on-scene officer to make it clear that Eason was <em><strong>not</strong></em> allowed to take any of the bikes, tools and/or pieces of yard equipment that were being swiped “right in full view of the cameras.”</p>



<p>The Ashley’s insider said that Jenelle then called the Sherriff’s Office and spoke to a Sergeant.</p>



<p>Once he was forced to put everything back, <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/10/22/david-eason-attempt-break-into-jenelle-evans-home-on-the-land-nearly-gets-arrested-for-trying-to-take-motorbikes-exclusive-details/">Eason got into an argument</a> with the deputy and, naturally, &#8220;narrowly avoided getting arrested,&#8221; this source adds.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="525" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510955" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-300x197.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/jenelle-evans-road-rage-fight-video-teen-mom-2-pp-768x504.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans is on the phone in this Teen Mom scene.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Eason and Evans are scheduled to come face-to-face next month for a hearing in regard to their divorce.</p>



<p>Earlier this summer, on an episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jenelle-evans-cut-from-teen-mom-again/">Evans referred to Eason</a> as &#8220;mentally abusive&#8221; and also told Briana DeJesus:</p>



<p>“He would throw objects, put holes in walls,&#8221; explaining of her move to Nevada:</p>



<p>“I feel like so much stuff has happened that it’s like, ‘I’ve got to get out and relocate and get that fresh start, leave all the bad memories behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alas, it sort of feels like there will never be an end to this saga, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans has left North Carolina for a new life in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>The troubled reality star announced her plans to move to Sin City during this week&#8217;s episode of <em>T<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/amber-portwood-leah-kristina-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">een Mom: The Next Chapter</a></em>.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, the decision to relocate had much to do with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/david-eason-jenelle-evans-is-a-thief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle&#8217;s messy divorce from David Eason</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-evans-reveals-intention-to-move-to-las-vegas">Jenelle Evans Reveals Intention to Move to Las Vegas</h2>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-returns-to-teen-mom-franchise-following-david-eason-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenelle was fired from the <em>Teen Mom</em> franchise</a> in 2019, it was largely due to David&#8217;s violent behavior.</p>



<p>Now that he&#8217;s out of the picture, she&#8217;s been permitted to return to the show that made her famous.</p>



<p>The Vegas bombshell came during a confessional in which Jenelle spoke candidly about her efforts to protect herself and her kids from her unstable ex.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="696" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-840011444-696x1024.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans attends the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California.

<p>&#8220;I think Vegas is definitely gonna be a space &#8212; life my safe haven and definitely a good safe haven for my kids. There&#8217;s just so much to look forward to for this move to Vegas,&#8221; Jenelle said.</p>



<p>&#8220;So much has happened in North Carolina, it&#8217;s just traumatized all of us in different ways,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>But despite her eagerness to set up her new life in Nevada, Jenelle was forced to return to North Carolina for a court date with David.</p>



<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to be here. But this week, I have a court case for a pending restraining order, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes,&#8221; she explained in a voice-over.</p>

<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel safe when I&#8217;m in North Carolina, because I don&#8217;t know if or where I can run into David.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s just capable of intimidating me. I feel harassed. I feel stalked. Now, every white truck on the highway, I&#8217;m staring at, and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s him,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jenelle-s-fight-for-freedom">Jenelle&#8217;s Fight For Freedom</h2>



<p>Over the course of her marriage, Jenelle took a lot of flak for defending <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jenelle-evans-this-is-why-i-finally-left-david-eason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David&#8217;s abusive behavior</a> toward children and animals.</p>

<p>Now, however, it appears that her actions were at least partially motivated by fear.</p>





<p>&#8220;My nerves are shot. I keep having panic attacks,&#8221; Jenelle told the camera.</p>



<p> &#8220;I keep thinking how I have to go on stand. It&#8217;s just all very scary. And I&#8217;m like, shaking. But I gotta do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sick of feeling this way. And even though he&#8217;s not here, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m still walking on eggshells, which sucks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following the hearing, Jenelle revealed to castmate Briana DeJesus that she was granted a six-month <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-granted-restraining-order-against-violent-bigoted-husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restraining order against David</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;All these fears in my head are just poof, gone now,&#8221; said a triumphant Evans.</p>



<p>Jenelle was recently spotted partying on the Las Vegas strip, so we guess the move went well.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s taken some criticism for leaving her kids at home to go out clubbing. But hey &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t be Jenelle if she weren&#8217;t stirring up controversy!</p>

<p>David Eason has reportedly found someone new to treat like absolute $hit.</p>



<p>The former Teen Mom star, who was fired by MTV years ago for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/">shooting and killing his family&#8217;s young dog</a>, is no longer married to Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>The polarizing cable network personality <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">filed to separate from Eason</a> in March.</p>



<p>He doesn&#8217;t seem very broken up about it, however.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="897" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1024x897.jpg" alt="David Eason and two kids" class="wp-image-503343" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1024x897.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-768x673.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-960x841.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1080x947.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688-1200x1052.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1128284688.jpg 1796w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason, Marissa Eason and Ensley Eason attend the Cosmopolitan NYFW fashion show during New York Fashion Week at Tribeca 360 on February 08, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on a number of recent TikTok videos, Eason is now dating someone named Kenleigh Heatwole.</p>



<p>On this social media platform, the often-violent bigot has turned the camera on himself while inside Kenleigh’s house&#8230; while making some meals in her kitchen&#8230; and also while singing, jet-skiing and, of course, throwing back some drinks at a bar.</p>



<p>Based on research conducted by our friends <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/07/02/david-eason-shows-off-his-new-galpal-plus-an-update-on-his-divorce-from-teen-mom-star-jenelle-evans-exclusive-details/">at The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>, it sounds as if:</p>



<p>Kenleigh is 25 years old.</p>



<p>She owns property in North Carlina.</p>



<p>She is a photographer and graphic designer.</p>



<p>She enjoys hunting, boating, and owns a Doberman &#8212; who should likely sleep with one eye open any time Eason is around.</p>

<p>In her aforementioned legal documents, Evans wrote that she has every &#8220;intent&#8221; to make her separation &#8220;permanent.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Throughout the duration of the marriage of the parties, the defendant has exhibited concerning and at times disturbing behavior towards the plaintiff,” she wrote in an attempt to expose Eason, later bringing up the incident that caused the couple to lost custody of its kids for about a month years ago:</p>



<p>“In May of 2019, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/jenelle-evans-david-eason-beat-and-killed-our-dog-because-thats/">Defendant shot and killed the family’s pet</a> French Bulldog Nugget in front of the minor child.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this same filing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Evans referenced the current felony charge</a> hanging over her spouse, which is the result of an alleged assault of her teenage son, Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle writes, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all been very ugly for a long time surrounding Eason, who has responded by claiming <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/david-eason-jenelle-evans-is-a-thief/">Evans is a thief</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not about to take sides in this messy split, but we are asking that Kenleigh Heatwole perhaps reconsider her romantic future.</p>

<p>Evans, for her part, was linked a short time ago to her manager, August Keen.</p>



<p>In her own recent TikTok video, we can Evans grab a man&#8217;s arm while the track “I Like The Way You Kiss Me” plays in the background.</p>



<p>However, after this rumor started to circulate around the Internet, Keen told In Touch Weekly simply:</p>



<p>&#8220;Jenelle is single.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jenelle Evans had her (latest) day in court on May 16.</p>



<p>The reality star &#8212; who has officially booked her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/jenelle-evans-returns-to-teen-mom-franchise-following-david-eason-split/">return to the Teen Mom franchise</a> &#8212; was granted a six-month restraining order on Thursday against her estranged husband, David Eason.</p>



<p>The legal document makes it illegal over that time period for Eason to contact Evans &#8230; to be on her property in North Carolina&#8230; and from talking about Jenelle at all on social media.</p>

<p>According to our friends at The Ashley&#8217;s Realty Roundup, both s<a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2024/05/16/david-eason-accuses-jenelle-evans-in-court-of-being-a-drug-addict-jenelle-defends-her-xanax-use-cries-when-asked-about-her-mother-barbara-exclusive/">pouses took to the stand</a> at this hearing.</p>



<p>“David accused her of being a drug addict, and said that Jenelle has taken Xanax the whole time they’ve been together,” a source told this website. </p>



<p>“Jenelle rebutted the claim that she’s a drug addict, and said she was prescribed Xanax and has been taking it for the last three years to help with her esophagus spasms. </p>



<p>&#8220;She told the judge that if she gets nervous or anxious, it will flare up her esophagus spasms and she will throw up.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Evans filed to separate from Eason</a> in February, stating at the time that her estranged husband was a drunk and a deadbeat dad.</p>



<p>The couple is parents to a young daughter named Ensley, while David has a teenage daughter from a previous relationship and Jenelle has a son named Kaiser with ex-Nathan Griffith and a son named Jace with ex Andrew Lewis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Eason was previously charged with a felony</a> for allegedly strangling Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle wrote in her separation filing, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>

<p>As for why a judge affirmed an order of protection at this hearing on Thursday, the aforementioned insider told The Ashley:</p>



<p>“The reason it was granted basically was that the amount of times David texted or talked about Jenelle could count as harassment.</p>



<p>&#8220;The judge granted it on the fact that Jenelle’s lawyer specifically claimed it was harassment, because David constantly talks about her, whether it’s in texts or social media or whatever. </p>



<p>&#8220;The restraining order was basically because they proved David was ‘harassing’ Jenelle.” </p>



<p>Indeed, Eason recently said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/david-eason-jenelle-evans-is-a-thief/">Evans was a thief and a cheater</a>.</p>

<p>Evans will need to re-file for another restraining order at these six months are up.</p>



<p>If Eason breaks the current one, he&#8217;ll be arrested and subjected to 48 hours in jail.</p>



<p>“He has some dark secrets no one knows but me,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jenelle-evans-im-afraid-my-husband-will-murder-me/">Evans told people on the Internet</a> in late April, saying she wasn&#8217;t permitted to say much more at the time due to an ongoing investigation&#8230; but adding in cryptic fashion that <em>IF</em> she did spill any of this tea:</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m scared and feel like my life would be on the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may not believe this, but David Eason has some mean things to say about Jenelle Evans.</p>



<p>The often-violent former reality star jumped on TikTok this past Saturday to both defend himself and also to tear into his estranged spouse, who finally <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">filed to separate from Eason in March</a>.</p>



<p>Amid accusations from Evans that he&#8217;s a drunk and deadbeat dad, Eason addressed speculation over the weekend that he&#8217;s in financial trouble by pointing a harsh finger in the direction of his ex.</p>

<p>“I would be making a lot more money but Jenelle took my money from me!” he told followers. </p>



<p>“If y’all want to know the truth! You’re all sitting out here talking about how I’m using her money. Well, how am I getting her money?”</p>



<p>Jenelle, of course, has tried to answer this question in the past.</p>



<p>According to a police report obtained by our friends at The Ashley’s Reality Roundup, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-to-police-help-my-husband-is-stealing-from-me/">Evans called local authorities</a> in North Carolina on March 6 to report that Eason had stolen her drivers license, her wallet and her credit cards.</p>



<p>This call was made just days after she filed for separation.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="767" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-1024x767.jpg" alt="David Eason and his family" class="wp-image-499298" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-768x575.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-728x546.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-480x360.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-960x719.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-1080x809.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1128284688-1200x899.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">David Eason, Marissa Eason, Ensley Eason and Jenelle Eason attend the Cosmopolitan NYFW fashion show during New York Fashion Week at Tribeca 360 on February 8, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>During this most recent TikTok exchange with all 12 or so of his fans, Eason said Jenelle “took all his clients” from him, presumably making a reference to his boat-cleaning business.</p>



<p>“She deleted everything on my phone, remotely,” Eason said, accidentally praising his ex for apparently having some impressive technological skills and adding: </p>



<p>“It cost me a lot of money.”</p>



<p>Eason has only spoken out a few times on his split from Jenelle, previously telling people on social media that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/david-eason-claims-jenelle-evans-cheated-on-him-threatens-to-eat-tiktok-users-dog/">Evans cheated on him a lot</a>.</p>

<p>“Why did we split? Because Jenelle cheated on me. She’s been cheating for years, actually,&#8221; Eason said about two months ago.</p>



<p>In legal documents obtained by The Sun several days prior to this allegation by David, Evans cited February 16 as the official date of the break-up and stating she has the “intent that the separation be permanent.”</p>



<p>She referred to “disturbing behavior” on the part of Eason, even bringing up <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/05/jenelle-evans-david-eason-beat-and-killed-our-dog-because-thats/">David having killed the family dog</a> in 2019.</p>



<p>When a TikTok user also mentioned this homicide back in March? Eason responded by naming the dead animal and firing back as follows:</p>



<p>“Where’s your f-cking Nugget? I will eat that motherf-cker! I’ll put hot sauce on his ass. I’ll make a jacket out of that motherf-cker.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="694" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-694x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-499304" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-694x1024.jpg 694w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-203x300.jpg 203w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-768x1134.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-1387x2048.jpg 1387w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-650x960.jpg 650w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-732x1080.jpg 732w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-813x1200.jpg 813w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-520070866-scaled.jpg 1734w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans and David Eason appear to have brought out the worst in each other.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking ahead, meanwhile, Eason doesn&#8217;t see himself walking down the aisle ever again.</p>



<p>“I’m not gonna say I’ll never date again, but I’ll never get married again!” Eason said on May 4 via TikTok. “That’s for sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: “There’s no reason to get married to anybody, ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sorry, ladies. Sounds like you won&#8217;t have a chance to lock down David Eason.</p>

<p>By his own admission, David Eason doesn&#8217;t always value the lives of others.</p>



<p>Case in most famous point?</p>



<p>The former Teen Mom participant <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/04/jenelle-evans-i-got-fired-again-all-because-david-killed-that-da/">shot and killed his family&#8217;s pet dog</a> back in 2019, prompting a Child Protective Services investigation and causing everyone to think of him as a fairly awful person.</p>



<p>Eason hasn&#8217;t done much in the years since to change our opinion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="888" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1024x888.jpg" alt="Jenelle Evans with ex David Eason" class="wp-image-498758" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-300x260.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-768x666.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-960x832.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1080x936.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862-1200x1040.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-520070862.jpg 1903w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jenelle Evans attends the 2016 MTV Movie Awards at Warner Bros.

<p>Now, meanwhile, Jenelle Evans says she&#8217;s afraid her estranged husband will move from murdering animals to murdering human beings.</p>



<p>Specifically, herself.</p>



<p>Via an Instagram Q&amp;A on April 26, Evans said the following about Eason:</p>



<p>“Everything he’s saying he’s just doing it to make himself ‘look better’ but in actuality he knows the person he truly is behind closed doors.</p>



<p>&#8220;He has some dark secrets no one knows but me.”</p>

<p>Early last month, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/jenelle-evans-files-to-separate-david-eason-is-a-drunk-and-a-deadbeat-and-im-done/">Evans filed to separate from Eason</a>.</p>



<p>She wrote in legal papers at the time that Eason was a deadbeat father and a drunk.</p>



<p>“Throughout the duration of the marriage of the parties, the defendant has exhibited concerning and at times disturbing behavior towards the plaintiff,” she wrote at one point, citing the aforementioned violent act against the family dog as evidence.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in this filing, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/david-eason-charged-with-new-felony-accused-of-strangling-stepson-jace/">Evans references the current felony charge</a> hanging over her spouse, which is the result of an alleged assault of her young son, Jace.</p>



<p>“On or about September 28 of 2023, a report was made to medical professionals by plaintiff’s oldest minor child,” Jenelle writes, adding that the sheriff’s office investigated the allegations and David was “subsequently charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.”</p>

<p>Back to the Q&amp;A&#8230;</p>



<p>When asked to divulge said secrets, Evans &#8212; who recently requested a domestic violence restraining order against David for herself and her children &#8212; said she was unable to do so.</p>



<p>“Not the right time but also I’m scared and feel like my life would be on the line,” she said, implying Eason would hurt her and later adding: </p>



<p>“There’s a huge investigation going on so I can’t comment on much at the moment.”</p>
