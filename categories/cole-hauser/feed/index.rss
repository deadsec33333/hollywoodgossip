<p>Cole Hauser could make a<em> Fast &amp; Furious</em> return, reprising his earlier role. Should he?</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/is-taylor-sheridan-a-republican-yellowstone-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone</a></em>, which returns November 10,<em> </em>has been a hit. The show has spawned spinoffs and fan theories and whole new fandoms for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/yellowstone-josh-lucas-engaged-brianna-ruffalo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its stars</a>.</p>



<p>One of those stars is Cole Hauser. But many also know him from the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> franchise.</p>



<p>After his success as Rip Wheeler, is it time for Cole Hauser to make a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> return?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cole-hauser-plays-rip-wheeler-on-yellowstone">Cole Hauser plays Rip Wheeler on &#8216;Yellowstone&#8217;</h2>



<p>On <em>Yellowstone</em>, Cole Hauser portrays the character of Rip Wheeler. </p>



<p>He is the foreman of the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch. He has a direct outlook on the world but a complex blend of motivations that help to make him a compelling character.</p>



<p>Cole Hauser has been a big part of bringing the character to life. There is, after all, more to acting than dressing the part and reading lines.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Cole Hauser on January 10, 2023." class="wp-image-512629" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_colehauser_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cole Hauser attends the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 10, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Yellowstone </em>viewers can attest that Rip Wheeler (what a name) balances ruthlessness and vulnerability. Sometimes, fans find themselves rooting for people who are clearly not good people.</p>



<p>Cole Hauser has done a commendable job portraying a character whose family trauma haunts him well into adulthood. His commitment to the Duttons, who took him in, explains &#8212; but does not excuse &#8212; much of his behavior.</p>



<p>But if you think that Cole Hauser looks vaguely familiar, you&#8217;re not wrong. His acting career has spanned decades, including cult classic masterpieces like<em> Pitch Black</em>. And one role in particular comes to mind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-before-yellowstone-cole-hauser-was-part-of-the-fast-amp-furious-franchise">Before &#8216;Yellowstone,&#8217; Cole Hauser was part of the &#8216;Fast &amp; Furious&#8217; franchise</h2>



<p>Fans are hopeful for a Cole Hauser <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> return because he has been in the films before. Specifically, one film: <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>.</p>



<p>That is the second film in the series, and perhaps the one with the most famous title. Cole Hauser took on the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> role of Carter Verone, a drug lord and an all-around not good dude.</p>



<p>Several antagonists from the <em>The Fast &amp; The Furious</em> franchise have undergone character arcs that make them more sympathetic, cooperative, and likable. But Carter Verone didn&#8217;t give off those vibes. And that&#8217;s due to Cole Hauser&#8217;s portrayal of him as an unscrupulous villain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="2 Fast 2 Furious - &quot;I&#039;ll Take My Cutter Back&quot; HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgTKQpmIEKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As part of the events of <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em>, Carter Verone ends up under arrest. But that doesn&#8217;t have to mean the end of Cole Hauser&#8217;s character.</p>



<p>Fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fastandfurious/comments/15ujy1v/we_need_cole_hauser_carter_verone_to_return_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> and beyond are suggesting that Cole Hauser could launch his <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> return. One commenter notes that a rich bad guy getting out of prison after 20 years is the &#8220;least unrealistic thing&#8221; for the franchise to do.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re specifically noting that Cole Hauser is getting added attention for his <em>Yellowstone </em>success. That sort of spotlight can mean that an obscure villain from a series&#8217; past can return with a vengeance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-everyone-is-on-board-however">Not everyone is on board, however</h2>



<p>But some longtime <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> fans don&#8217;t want to see a Cole Hauser return, but it&#8217;s not because of the actor himself. He&#8217;s acquitted himself well on screens large and small.</p>



<p>Some note that, if someone from <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em> is going to return, it should be Devon Aoki or Eva Mendes. They, these fans argue, would be more interesting.</p>



<p>Also? Cole Hauser did such a good job portraying the villainous Carter Verone that offering the character a return or a redemption arc could rub some fans the wrong way. Either way, he&#8217;s doing a bang-up job on <em>Yellowstone</em>.</p>
