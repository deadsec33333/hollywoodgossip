<p>Tragic news from the world of sports today, as former MLB star Octavio Dotel has passed away at the age of 51.</p>



<p>Preliminary reports indicate that Dotel was one of 44 people who were killed when the roof of a nightclub collapsed in the Dominican Republic.</p>



<p>Multiple news outlets initially reported that he had been removed from the rubble still alive.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-octavio-dotel-is-now-believed-to-have-passed-away">Octavio Dotel is now believed to have passed away</h2>



<p>According to a report from <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/08/world-news/at-least-13-dead-when-roof-collapses-at-popular-dominican-republic-nightclub/">The New York Post</a></em>, Dotel, along with eight others, was alive when he was discovered by rescue workers.</p>



<p>Sadly, he later succumbed to his injuries at a nearby hospital.</p>



<p>The retired MLB pitcher, who played for 13 teams over the course of his 15-year career, was one of more than 150 clubgoers who had packed in for a performance by merengue singer Rubby Pérez.</p>



<p>“It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” Dotel&#8217;s manager, Enrique Paulino, told reporters.</p>

<p>At press time, police indicated that rescue crews were still sifting through the debris to find additional survivors.</p>



<p>“We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” said a spokesperson.</p>



<p>The cause of the collapse remains unknown, and local officials say they&#8217;re doing everything in their power to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>

<p>“We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred,” President Luis Abinader wrote on X today, according to the <em>Post</em>.</p>



<p>“We stand in solidarity with the families of the victims, the injured, and all the Dominican people at this difficult time,” Charge d’Affaires Patricia Aguilera wrote on Facebook.</p>



<p>“We appreciate the tireless efforts of the rescue teams,” she added.</p>



<p>Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Monrecristi and sister of baseball legend Nelson Cruz, was also among the deceased.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available,</p>

<p>Is Hailee Steinfeld pregnant?</p>



<p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/hailee-steinfelds-engaged-to-josh-allen-and-now-swifities-are-pressuring-travis-to-propose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Allen and Steinfeld&#8217;s engagement</a> made headlines.</p>



<p>Their relationship even drew comparisons to a more high-profile celebrity-sports crossover romance: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.</p>



<p>Now, fans are offering the couple their congratulations for the baby on the way.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Josh Allen on January 12, 2025." class="wp-image-517728" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_joshallen_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Josh Allen #17 of the Buffalo Bills walks off the field after defeating the Denver Broncos 31-7 during the AFC Wild Card Playoffs at Highmark Stadium on January 12, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Elsa/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-josh-allen-and-hailee-steinfeld-are-engaged">Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld are engaged</h2>



<p>Buffalo Bills quarterback and reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen is so well known that his name was cropping up outside of sports circles even before his relationship with actress and singer Hailee Steinfeld became public.</p>



<p>Admittedly, a non-football viewer might have just heard about him because he&#8217;s unusually handsome. But that&#8217;s not a bad reason to be famous.</p>



<p>On the field, he&#8217;s been doing well. The Buffalo Bills have been on a winning streak.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="793" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-793x1024.jpg" alt="Hailee Steinfeld on October 30, 2024." class="wp-image-517729" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-793x1024.jpg 793w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-232x300.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-768x992.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-1586x2048.jpg 1586w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-743x960.jpg 743w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-836x1080.jpg 836w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-929x1200.jpg 929w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0124_haileesteinfeld_01-scaled.jpg 1982w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hailee Steinfeld attends the Netflix Arcane LA Premiere at The Egyptian Theatre Hollywood on October 30, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Riot / Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Off of the field, Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld became engaged in late 2024. In early December, Allen spoke about the happy news in Steinfeld&#8217;s <a href="https://beausociety.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beau Society</a> newsletter.</p>



<p>“I was very nervous. I think I was most nervous about you finding out about the proposal,” he admitted at the time.</p>



<p>“It was hard to keep secrets from you and have other people in your life keep secrets from you,&#8221; Allen pointed out. &#8220;Then, multiple times throughout the day a song would come on and I would tear up thinking about how special our day was going to be.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-hailee-steinfeld-pregnant">Is Hailee Steinfeld pregnant?</h2>



<p>“I said, ‘I couldn’t wait any longer.’ I said, ‘I can’t wait to start a family with you,’” Allen described in that stame newsletter. He continued: “I said your full name, and I asked you very nicely. I said please.”</p>



<p>Recently, fans believed that his desire to have a baby with the <em>Hawkeye </em>actress may be in the works.</p>



<p>Allen and Steinfeld appeared in gender reveal party photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFAWaI6IIHO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> and beyond. (According to the color coding of this event, by the way, someone&#8217;s expecting a daughter)</p>

<p>Congratulations poured in on social media, with numerous commenters congratulating Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld for being pregnant with their first child.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seems like every football player who has gotten someone pregnant has had a rough year,&#8221; one <a href="https://x.com/attitude__music/status/1865198394689368348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> warned with an unnecessarily ominous tone.</p>



<p>However, these were responses to Allen and Hailee attending a friend&#8217;s gender reveal party &#8212; and to month-old reports on their excitement to start a family, which came up in the interview after their engagement news.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-have-plenty-of-time">They have plenty of time</h2>



<p>Right now, Josh has plenty on his plate. Though his football season has come to an end, performing at Allen&#8217;s takes up a lot of time and energy year-round.</p>



<p>And the second season of <em>Arcane </em>just wrapped late last year. Social media is still processing the Netflix series with art, headcanons, and more. Hailee Steinfeld is also well known for portraying Kate Bishop in the MCU. If Marvel doesn&#8217;t inexcusably fumble this, we could have the long-anticipated <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/selena-gomez-agatha-all-along/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Avengers</a></em> project that fans have been wanting for years.</p>



<p>Obviously, both Allen and Steinfeld&#8217;s real lives should come first. We&#8217;re just saying &#8230; they&#8217;re already pretty busy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-miller-gardner-passed-away-after-falling-ill-during-family-vacation">Miller Gardner passed away after &#8216;falling ill&#8217; during family vacation</h2>



<p>&#8220;With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller. He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Yankees/status/1903854341737386272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1903854341737386272%7Ctwgr%5Eb99c374d46165f337905c8f057275ef561d353f9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fmlb%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F44370975%2Fex-yankees-brett-gardner-son-miller-gardner-dies-14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read the statement</a>.</p>



<p>“We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st.&#8221;</p>



<p>The location and exact cause of Miller&#8217;s death remain unclear. </p>



<p>&#8220;Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day,&#8221; the family&#8217;s statement continues.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss. </p>



<p>&#8220;Our prayers go out to Miller&#8217;s teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please respect our wishes for privacy as we mourn and search for healing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally, there&#8217;s been a great deal of interest in the cause of Miller&#8217;s death, but hopefully, the public will continue to respect the Gardner family&#8217;s privacy.</p>



<p>Whatever illness afflicted Miller seems to have struck other family members as well, so it&#8217;s safe to assume that it was some sort of contagious or foodborne pathogen.</p>



<p>Other than that simple assertion, all other speculation on the matter is without basis.</p>



<p>We will have further information on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we would like to express our condolences to the Gardner family during this enormously difficult time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-george-foreman-s-family-confirms-his-passing-issues-statement">George Foreman&#8217;s family confirms his passing, issues statement </h2>



<p>Foreman&#8217;s family issued a statement late Friday evening confirming his death:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-sports-legend-lost">A sports legend lost</h2>



<p>Foreman was a two-time heavyweight champion, an entrepreneur, author, and minister, who&#8217;s been a household name for generations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Big George&#8221; famously lost the first fight of his career when he squared off Muhammad Ali in 1974 in a bout that was dubbed &#8220;the Rumble in the Jungle.&#8221;</p>



<p>The match remains one of the most-watched sporting events of all time.</p>

<p>Foreman won the heavyweight gold medal with a dominant performance at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.</p>



<p>The most famous victory of his career came in his championship bout against Joe Frazier in Jamaica in 1973. </p>



<p>Foreman dominated the fight against his heavily favored opponent, leading to the famous Howard Cossell call &#8220;Down goes Frazier!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-legend-two-times-over">A legend two times over</h2>



<p>In his later years, Foreman became one of the most successful ad pitchmen of all time.</p>



<p>His George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine &#8212; later known simply as &#8220;the Foreman Grill&#8221; &#8212; remains one of America&#8217;s most popular kitchen implements.</p>



<p>At the time of his death, Foreman remained one of the world&#8217;s most famous athletes.</p>



<p>The sports legend is survived by 12 children. Our thoughts go out to his loved ones at this enormously difficult time. </p>

<p>As you&#8217;ve probably heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/blake-lively-banned-from-taylor-swifts-super-bowl-suite-amid-justin-baldoni-feud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Kansas City Chiefs suffered a humiliating defeat in Super Bowl LIX</a> last month.</p>



<p>And while the denizens of Chiefs Kingdom are surely still suffering, it&#8217;s possible that no spectator took the loss as hard as Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>As expected, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-booed-by-hostile-crowd-at-super-bowl-lix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor was in attendance</a> at New Orleans&#8217; Caesars Superdome.</p>

<p>And the pop icon <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looked devastated as the Chiefs fell to the Philadelphia Eagles</a> in a game that was essentially over before halftime.</p>



<p>For Taylor, of course, this was more than just a football game.</p>



<p>After all, multiple aspects of her life and her relationship with Travis Kelce were reportedly hanging in the balance before kickoff. And now, Swifties are wondering where the couple stands.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-get-engaged">Did Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Get Engaged?</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jalen Hurts #1 of the Philadelphia Eagles and Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs meet after Philadelphia beat Kansas City 40-22 to win Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana." class="wp-image-518862" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198618935-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jalen Hurts #1 of the Philadelphia Eagles and Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs meet after Philadelphia beat Kansas City 40-22 to win Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As Travis and the Chiefs attempted to make history with a third straight Super Bowl win, there were rumors that Kelce planned to celebrate by <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/travis-kelce-hey-i-might-propose-to-taylor-swift-at-the-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposing to Taylor</a> on the field.</p>



<p>Needless to say, that didn&#8217;t happen, as the only ones celebrating were Jalen Hurts and the Eagles.</p>



<p>We suppose it&#8217;s still possible that Travis proposed privately after the game, and the couple is still keeping it under wraps. But that seems unlikely, as the festive atmosphere he was reportedly hoping for failed to materialize.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="701" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-1024x701.jpg" alt="Ashley Avignone, Taylor Swift, Alana Haim, Este Haim, Danielle Haim and mgk attend Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana." class="wp-image-518860" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-300x205.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-768x526.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-2048x1401.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-960x657.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-1080x739.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198616405-1200x821.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley Avignone, Taylor Swift, Alana Haim, Este Haim, Danielle Haim and mgk attend Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-travis-retire">Will Travis Retire?</h2>



<p>Another thing that was rumored to be hanging on the outcome of the game was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/is-travis-kelce-benched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis&#8217; decision regarding retirement</a>.</p>



<p>The legendary tight end is 35, and insiders predicted that he would hang up his cleats if the Chiefs made history by becoming the first team to win three straight Super Bowls.</p>



<p>After all, such an achievement would be hard to top, and with thriving careers as an actor and podcast host, Travis wouldn&#8217;t be in danger of getting bored.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs walks off the field at half time against the Philadelphia Eagles during Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana." class="wp-image-518859" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198608678-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs walks off the field at half time against the Philadelphia Eagles during Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But we no know that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/travis-kelce-announces-nfl-retirement-decision-what-does-it-mean-for-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelce likely will not retire</a>. He&#8217;ll join the Chiefs for at least one more attempt at Super Bowl glory.</p>



<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t played that bad all year,” Kelce told reporters after his team fell to the Eagles in February (per <em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2025/02/10/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-retirement-super-bowl/78380382007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a></em>).</p>



<p>&#8220;Hats off to the Eagles, they got after us, all three phases. Couldn’t get it going offensively. Turnovers, penalties, playing behind the sticks on offense. Dropped passes, not taking advantage of the play calls and executing.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Travis intends to make some big decisions about his personal life during this offseason. But for now, he seems focused on licking his wounds.</p>

<p>Travis Kelce has arrived at a decision about his future.</p>



<p>No, the legendary tight end has not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/is-taylor-swift-engaged/">proposed to Taylor Swift</a>. Not yet at least. Not to our knowledge. We&#8217;re not talking about the athlete&#8217;s <em>personal</em> future.</p>



<p>When it comes to his <em>professional</em> future, however, and what it holds? Well&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming back for sure. Gonna try to get into the best shape I&#8217;ve been this offseason and get back to the mountaintop,&#8221; Kelce wrote in a text to television host Pat McAfee on Thursday. </p>



<p>Added Kelce, whose <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/">team got clobbered in the most recent Super Bowl</a>:</p>



<p>&#8220;Got a real bad taste in my mouth with how I played in that last game and with how I got the guys ready for battle. I can&#8217;t go out like that!!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>So there we have it. Kelce will return next year to try and win another championship ring with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519089" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198007775-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce talks during media availability prior to Super Bowl LIX at the New Orleans Marriott on February 6, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The future Hall of Famer was held to four catches for 39 yards in the Chiefs&#8217; 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.</p>



<p>That performance ended a season in which Kelce posted career lows in receiving yards (823) and touchdowns (3). He did lead the team in receptions, however, with 97.</p>



<p>Following the disappointing setback on February 9, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said he was &#8220;not sure&#8221; if Kelce would return to the NFL for another season.</p>



<p>Mahomes also said he&#8217;s going to &#8220;let Travis make that decision on his own,&#8221; adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s given so much to this team and to the NFL. And he&#8217;s been such a joy, not only for me to work with, but for people to watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelce has been selected to play in the Pro Bowl 10 times and was a first-team All-Pro pick four times and a second-team choice three times.</p>



<p>The guy is really good and always has been.</p>



<p>Of late, of course, Kelce has become far better known as Taylor Swift&#8217;s boyfriend.</p>



<p>With rumors of another <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-tour-another-coming-in-2026/">Taylor Swift tour coming in 2026</a>, some observers thought maybe Kelce would hang up his cleats and just follow the singer around the globe for awhile.</p>



<p>Alas, Travis Kelce as a perpetual groupie will need to wait at least one more year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia Eagles trounced the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX</a>.</p>



<p>But the game is still making headlines thanks to an unexpected controversy.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s customary for Super Bowl champs to pay a visit to the White House for a photo op with the president.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/donald-trump-taunts-taylor-swift-after-singer-gets-booed-at-super-bowl/">Donald Trump was in attendance at this year&#8217;s game</a> &#8212; a first for a sitting US president &#8212; and it was expected that winning team would follow tradition.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="705" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198619662-1024x705.jpg" alt="Jalen Hurts #1 of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to win Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

<p>But eight days after Jalen Hurts led his team to victory in New Orleans, it&#8217;s still unclear if the Eagles will show up at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.</p>



<p>The more time that passes, the more unlikely the visit becomes. But who&#8217;s to blame for the delay?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-administration-has-not-extended-an-invitation-to-the-eagles-insiders-claim">Trump administration has not extended an invitation to the Eagles, insiders claim</h2>



<p>Despite social media rumors to the contrary, the Eagles have reportedly <em>not</em> turned down an invitation to the White House.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll be flocking to the South Lawn anytime soon.</p>

<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/24/philadelphia-eagles-white-house-invite-donald-trump/?adid=social-tw">TMZ</a>, Saquon Barkley and company have not been invited to the White House.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear if that&#8217;s by design, or if the administration has simply been too busy taking a chainsaw to the federal workforce.</p>



<p>Either way, it&#8217;s beginning to seem unlikely that A.J. Brown will not be able to lend the president a copy of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/inner-excellence-author-eagles-player-going-viral-reading-book-sidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his favorite self-help book</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like both sides have mutually agreed to keep their distance. But because we live in the age of misinformation, thousands of X users (including some professional journalists) believe that the Eagles snubbed the White House.</p>



<p>&#8220;GO F YOURSELVES EAGLES. My husband is a fan so I got onboard but F this BS,&#8221; Megyn Kelly wrote, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/philadelphia-eagles-invitation-maga-white-house-trump-super-bowl-2035202">Newsweek</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eagles won&#8217;t visit The White House? Oh cool. Pull all their funding. Every dime. If the NFL hates America then America needs to start hating the NFL,&#8221; another user added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Philadelphia Eagles have rejected Trump&#8217;s invitation to the White House. You know what, I will never support that team again. F&#8211;k the Eagles,&#8221; a former fan opined.</p>

<p>Of course, the team received a good deal of support, as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;BRAVO to the Philadelphia Eagles for declining Trump&#8217;s invitation to the White House. The eagle is a widespread symbol of STRENGTH, POWER, FREEDOM, &amp; WISDOM. These team members proudly held on to their self-respect &amp; dignity!&#8221; one user tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trump openly rooted against the eagles and didn&#8217;t congratulate them… the eagles have every right not to do so,&#8221; sports journalist Chris Schaller chimed in.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not often that professional athletes who just won a major championship take so much flak. But that&#8217;s low on the list of the four million ways in which we&#8217;re living in unprecedented times.</p>

<p>Shocking news out of the world of sports today, as Lavar Ball has revealed that his right foot has been amputated.</p>



<p>Lavar, who is the father of Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball, has been a high-profile figure in the NBA for several years.</p>



<p>He first came to attention for making bold claims about the talents and career prospects of his three sons.</p>



<p>Amazingly, Lavar&#8217;s boasts turned out to be mostly justified.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="875" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-1024x875.jpg" alt="US entrepreneur LaVar Ball waves upon his arrival with his sons at Vilnius airport in Lithuania, on January 3, 2018, as the two teenagers arrive in the country to make their basketball pro career debut in the Lithuanian Vytautas club." class="wp-image-519661" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-1024x875.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-300x256.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-768x656.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-2048x1749.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-960x820.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-1080x923.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-900908276-1200x1025.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">US entrepreneur LaVar Ball waves upon his arrival with his sons at Vilnius airport in Lithuania, on January 3, 2018, as the two teenagers arrive in the country to make their basketball pro career debut in the Lithuanian Vytautas club.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (PETRAS MALUKAS/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ball-family-s-success-is-beyond-belief">The Ball family&#8217;s success is beyond belief</h2>



<p>Lonzo and LaMelo are both stars in the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/will-lebron-james-retire-from-the-nba-following-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a> (Lonzo with the Chicago Bulls, LaMelo with the Charlotte Hornets). And while LiAngelo never made it to the league, he&#8217;s found tremendous success in the world of music.</p>



<p>In addition to raising three very successful sons, Lamar is no slouch when it comes to securing the bag himself.</p>



<p>His Big Baller Brand apparel company has seen consistent sales since it launched back in 2016.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-going-on-with-lavar-s-health">What&#8217;s going on with Lavar&#8217;s health?</h2>

<p>News of Lavar&#8217;s amputation was first reported by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/19/lavar-ball-foot-amputated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>. At the moment, further information about his condition is hard to come by. But that&#8217;s not terribly surprising. </p>



<p>After all, this is a man who made his fortune in part by projecting strength and success. So it makes sense that he would choose to keep his health issues to himself.</p>



<p>Many have speculated that the amputation is a result of diabetes or some other lifelong condition, but we don&#8217;t know anything for sure.</p>



<p>It does seem, however, that the procedure was planned and not the result of an accident or injury.</p>

<p>Because we live in very dark times, some folks saw fit to make jokes about the situation. Thankfully, most social media users were quick to offer words of support.</p>



<p>&#8220;The fact that Lavar ball is still smiling after having his foot amputated is wild. People love to hate him but he’s done nothing but care about his sons and bring positivity to everyone,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/iam_johnw/status/1892291336021114946?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote one user</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;No Lavar Ball slander will be tolerated getting a foot amputated is no joke,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/67x4L/status/1892291582180635111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another added</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn prayers up for Lavar Ball just heard he had his leg amputated,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Troydan/status/1892302171732951254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third chimed in</a>.</p>

<p>Lavar&#8217;s sons have yet to speak publicly on the situation.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to the entire family as Lavar begins his recovery process.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Today, at the Eagles&#8217; victory parade, star safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson wore a hoodie with an offensive message directed at Taylor Swift fans.</p>



<p>The shirt was emblazoned with the slogan &#8220;Swifties Can LIX My Balls.&#8221; The Roman numerals refer to the number of this year&#8217;s Super Bowl. </p>

<p>How did we get to this point? And why is Johnson so angry at Swifties? Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>



<p>After Gardner-Johnson took a swipe at Travis Kelce &#8212; one that targeted his girlfriend, Taylor Swift &#8212; Swifties started  hitting back.</p>



<p>And some of these over-eager fans went too far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-c-j-gardner-johnson-say-about-taylor-swift">What did C.J. Gardner-Johnson say about Taylor Swift?</h2>

<p>Is there such a thing as a <em>sore winner</em>? Sometimes, it seems that way.</p>



<p>In the wake of the Philadelphia Eagles&#8217; Super Bowl victory on Sunday, C.J. Gardner-Johnson took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ceedy.duce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story to seemingly taunt Travis Kelce &#8230; while body-shaming Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>Posting a photo of himself in front of Kelce, Gardner-Johnson wrote: &#8220;Should&#8217;ve Stayed w that thick s&#8211;t.&#8221; The assumption is that he is referring to the body type of Taylor Swift in contrast to the body of Kelce&#8217;s ex, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kayla-nicole-stuns-taylor-swift-fans-reveals-shes-a-closet-swiftie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kayla Nicole.</a></p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨🚨WILD🚨🚨🚨<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Eagles</a> DB CJ Gardner-Johnson goes after Travis Kelce on his Instagram story this morning. <br><br>“Should’ve stayed with that thick sh*t.”<br><br>He is talking about Kelce breaking up with Kayla Nicole for Taylor Swift. <a href="https://t.co/qSaGEzlDKj">pic.twitter.com/qSaGEzlDKj</a></p>&mdash; MLFootball (@_MLFootball) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MLFootball/status/1888992114928701599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Just to get this out of the way &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kayla-nicole-stuns-taylor-swift-fans-reveals-shes-a-closet-swiftie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kayla Nicole seems to be a Taylor Swift fan</a>. It seems unlikely that she appreciates C.J. Gardner-Johnson using her to taunt her ex.</p>



<p>More importantly, Gardner-Johnson seems to be body-shaming Swift, implying that she is less desirable due to her body shape.</p>



<p>While we don&#8217;t imagine that this will hit home with the pop star billionaire, it does send a very harmful message to countless young women who might (understandably) thirst after Gardner-Johnson and believe themselves to be inadequate. Body-shaming is truly never okay.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-of-taylor-swift-are-exacting-revenge-upon-c-j-gardner-johnson">Fans of Taylor Swift are exacting revenge upon C.J. Gardner-Johnson</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, revenge is seldom as nice as it appears in stories. Damage is often misplaced. And, many would argue, the energy that goes into revenge would be more useful improving one&#8217;s own life.</p>



<p>But Taylor Swift fans took aim at C.J. Gardner Johnson in the aftermath of his post. They&#8217;re doing so by leaving <a href="https://x.com/_MLFootball/status/1889108737069375930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative reviews</a> towards a restaurant, King&#8217;s Grill.</p>



<p>King&#8217;s Grill is an eatery in Rockledge, Florida. The owner is Delatron Johnson, the mother of C.J. Gardner-Johnson. Which means that this business, and Gardner-Johnson&#8217;s mother, is collateral damage.</p>

<p>Many restaurant owners have accused Yelp of being a less than helpful service. However, the sudden influx of one-star reviews was enough to trigger an &#8220;Unusual Activity Alert&#8221; for the restaurant&#8217;s page.</p>



<p>As a result, no one can leave fresh comments or negative reviews. Presumably, this will change when the excitement dies down.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Google reviews have also undergone changes. It appears that the recent influx of reviews have simply been removed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-the-way">This is not the way</h2>



<p>Like Taylor Swift, C.J. Gardner-Johnson is responsible for his own choices. His mother and her restaurant are not.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s likely that an Eagles player has enough dough to keep a family restaurant afloat no matter what, that&#8217;s not really the point.</p>



<p>Perhaps these Taylor Swift fans &#8212; and Chiefs fans, who have also been getting in on the action &#8212; should consider what an appropriate, proportional response to Gardner-Johnson&#8217;s juvenile taunt might be. This is not it.</p>

<p>Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco have broken up.</p>



<p>The former professional football player and the Victoria&#8217;s Secret model had been dating for less than one year.</p>



<p>Now, it&#8217;s over. And just in time for Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>Looks like Johnny Football has fumbled this one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-johnny-manziel-and-josie-canseco-have-broken-up">Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco have broken up</h2>



<p>On Thursday, February 13, <em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/13/johnny-manziel-josie-canseco-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ Sports</a></em> reported that Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco have broken up.</p>



<p>The two had been together for less than a year.</p>



<p>In the past, Manziel has had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/02/johnny-manziel-denies-abusing-girlfriend-threatening-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrible breakups</a>. However, the report says that he and Canseco had an amicable split &#8212; with no bitter feelings over how things ended.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-683x1024.jpg" alt="Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco together on November 1, 2024." class="wp-image-519223" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0213_johnnymanziel_04-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Josie Canseco and Johnny Manziel attend Darren Dzienciol&#8217;s Haunted Hotel Presented by Utopia &amp; Casa Azul Organic Tequila at Fairmont Century Plaza on November 01, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Darren Dzienciol and Utopia &amp;amp; Casa Azul)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the report, Manziel was a good &#8212; even great &#8212; boyfriend to Canseco.</p>



<p>However, as he has made abundantly clear over the years, Manziel has some work to do on himself. That&#8217;s pretty vague, but we get the gist of the report.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a loving partner can help you through a tough time. But there are times when you need to work on yourself before you can be there as a real partner to someone long term.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-were-the-signs-that-johnny-manziel-and-josie-canseco-split">What were the signs that Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco split?</h2>



<p>Ahead of this breakup news, Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco were no longer following each other on Instagram.</p>



<p>Additionally, you don&#8217;t see many traces of each other on their pages.</p>



<p>There are cases where that&#8217;s part of a &#8220;purge&#8221; or a publicity stunt to promote something. But in this case, it just looks like an ominous hint at their split.</p>

<p>However, the vibes were <em>very </em>different back in January.</p>



<p>Alongside a slew of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kevin-costner-jennifer-lopez-talking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other celebrities</a>, Manziel and Canseco traveled to Aspen.</p>



<p>Mere weeks ago, the two appeared to be all over each other. It is remarkable how quickly things can change.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-relationship-lasted-for-less-than-one-year">Their relationship lasted for less than one year</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t know the exact date on which Johnny Manziel and Josie Canseco first locked eyes. But apparently they hit things off at Travis Scott&#8217;s charity softball event in 2024. (That same event is coming up again)</p>



<p>The two sparked romance speculation in April of 2024 when they looked incredibly cozy on a plane together.</p>



<p>Weeks later, speculation became confirmation when the two made their relationship status clear at Stagecoach. It&#8217;s unclear when, or if, either of them will announce the split. Some exes simply prefer to quietly move on.</p>
