<p>Very sad today out of the entertainment world:</p>



<p>Doug Kiker, a singer who impressed viewers on Season 18 of American Idol, has passed away.</p>



<p>He was 32 years old.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-521345" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/American-Idol-Season-18-Contestant-Doug-Kiker-Dead-at-32-He-Was-So-Loved-251.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">May singer Doug Kiker rest in peace.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (FOX)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This awful development was confirmed on Thursday by the loved ones of Kiker.</p>



<p>“It is with a heavy heart that we have to announce the passing of my brother, Douglas Kiker,” the singer’s sister, Angela Evans, wrote via Facebook, for example. </p>



<p>“He was sooo loved and will be missed by so many! You’re singing with the angels now Bubba. Please pray for our family as we go [through] this very difficult time.”</p>



<p>No cause of death has been announced at this time.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="942" height="623" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/doug-kiker-american-idol-2019-billboard-1548.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-521346" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/doug-kiker-american-idol-2019-billboard-1548.webp 942w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/doug-kiker-american-idol-2019-billboard-1548-300x198.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/doug-kiker-american-idol-2019-billboard-1548-768x508.webp 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Doug Kiker sings here on American Idol.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A native of Mobile, Alabama, Kiker competed on the ABC competition back 2020, earning the nickname at the time as “The Singing Garbage Man” due to his day job as a sanitation worker. </p>



<p>His audition moved then-judge Katy Perry to tears, as the aspiring artist performed Rascal Flatts’ “Bless the Broken Road.” </p>



<p>Although he was eliminated the following round after singing Marvin Gaye’s “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” Kiker was later invited back to virtually perform “Bless the Broken Road” with the aforementioned country trio.</p>



<p>“For a man who has no idea what his voice can do, for a man who has no idea what key he’s singing in, for a man who has no idea who the heck he can be, he’s here to do one thing: He’s trying to show his daughter that he’s somebody,” judge Lionel Richie said of Kiker on Season 18, adding: </p>



<p>“I want us all to let you know, you’re a hell of a man. I want you to come get this ticket. You’re going to Hollywood!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="493" height="286" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/X76PQIZHNNA73PVXI2KL4UBH5U-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521347" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/X76PQIZHNNA73PVXI2KL4UBH5U-copy.jpg 493w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/X76PQIZHNNA73PVXI2KL4UBH5U-copy-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Doug Kiker showed off impressive talent on American Idol in 2020.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (ABC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kiker’s sister Donna Kiker Carrillos-Ramirez also issued a statement on her relative&#8217;s passing.</p>



<p>“Today, I got the call that no one wants to get. We lost an amazing person today. He had the biggest smile and knew how to make you laugh,” Carrillos-Ramirez wrote via Facebook on Wednesday. “I know I didn’t raise him, but I never stopped loving him. </p>



<p>&#8220;My parents did an amazing job with him. Douglas Kiker, you will forever be missed. Fly high. Say hey to grandma.”</p>



<p>Kiker is survived by two children.</p>



<p>A GoFundMe has been set up for Doug by Donna.</p>



<p>&#8220;Help Us Lay Our Loved One to Rest It is with heavy hearts that we have to say goodbye to one of the most sincere souls and most hilarious person of all. Douglas, a beloved son, brother, father and friend,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/farewell-to-douglas-help-his-family">GoFundMe</a> reads.</p>



<p>&#8220;Any contribution, no matter the amount, will go directly to the funeral costs and allow us to navigate this difficult time without the added financial burden. Thank you for your love, support, and generosity during this incredibly difficult time. We greatly appreciate each and everyone of y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>

<p>They&#8217;re two of the best singers on the planet.</p>



<p>They are each American Idol champions.</p>



<p>And yet&#8230; Carrie Underwood and Kelly Clarkson haven&#8217;t exactly been the best of friends.</p>



<p>But is that all? Are the artists simply not close? Or has there always been some of rivalry between Clarkson and Underwood?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="680" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-1024x680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521252" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-300x199.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-768x510.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-2048x1359.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-960x637.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-1080x717.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-981588988-1200x796.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood attend the 2018 Radio Disney Music Awards at Loews Hollywood Hotel on June 12, 2018 in Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by VALERIE MACON / AFP)        (Photo credit should read VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of late, there&#8217;s been chatter over a possible feud between the superstars&#8230; most likely because <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ariana-grande-carrie-underwood-shade/">Underwood faced technical difficulties</a> during her performance of “America the Beautiful” at the Presidential inauguration in January.</p>



<p>By contrast, Clarkson knocked it totally out of the park when she sang at the Barack Obama inauguration in 2013.</p>



<p>Underwood also faced criticism for simply agreeing to perform at an event that honored Donald Trump.</p>



<p>“I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-im-not-maga-i-just-love-america/">Underwood said in response</a> to the backlash via statement to People Magazine, adding earlier this year:</p>



<p>“I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood on January 20, 2025." class="wp-image-517357" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/0121_carrieunderwood_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Country singer Carrie Underwood performs during inauguration ceremonies in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Many critics doubt that Clarkson would have accepted a similar invitation in the name of such a polarizing Commander-in-Chief.</p>



<p>“For years, fans have speculated that she and Kelly Clarkson don’t get along,” a source recently said to In Touch Weekly, continuing as follows:</p>



<p>“Aside from the obvious &#8212; they’re both moms and singers &#8212; they don’t really have much in common. They’ve just never really connected as friends.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="677" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-1024x677.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood performs on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; at Rumsey Playfield, Central Park on August 02, 2024 in New York City." class="wp-image-516650" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-300x198.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-768x508.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-2048x1354.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-960x635.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-1080x714.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2164966685-1200x793.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood performs on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; at Rumsey Playfield, Central Park on August 2, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Both American Idol champions have downplayed comparison in the past, along with any tension in their relationship.</p>



<p>Back in 2018, Clarkson Tweeted “we’re both winning in life and pretty blessed,&#8221; to which Carrie replied: “Whatever, girl, I voted for you!” </p>



<p>Fast forward to 2023 when Clarkson was a guest on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen and this same topic was broached. </p>



<p>“There’s no beef between us,” Clarkson insisted on air back then. “There’s nothing between us. We don’t even know each other well enough!”</p>

<p>Is Luke Bryan leaving <em>American Idol</em> next? </p>



<p>Fans of the reality show are starting to worry that the beginning of the end of <em>Idol</em> has begun.</p>



<p>With Katy Perry unexpectedly announcing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/katy-perry-leaving-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her exit</a> last year, the world is turning its eyes to the country king sitting on the panel next to her.</p>



<p>Will Luke Bryan leave the show soon? More importantly, will it even be his CHOICE?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-luke-bryan-leaving-american-idol-could-he-be-let-go-from-new-season">Luke Bryan Leaving &#8216;American Idol&#8217;: Could He Be Let Go From New Season?</h2>



<p>Luke Bryan joined&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/whoopi-goldberg-says-american-idol-sparked-the-downfall-of-society-appears-to-be-serious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a></em>&nbsp;as a judge for season 16, at the same time as Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.</p>



<p>The show was revived after its &#8220;farewell&#8221; season after fans demanded its return. </p>



<p>The trio have been beloved by fans, with many suggesting they are the perfect balance of judges. </p>



<p>But in February 2024, Katy Perry announced that the upcoming season of the show would be her last. The bombshell announcement was apparently made without any warning given to Luke and Lionel.</p>



<p>A few months later, <em>Entertainment Tonight </em>caught up with Luke and he admitted that he didn&#8217;t know his fate with the show. In fact, no one knows who will be back next season!</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been interesting,&#8221;&nbsp;the country star said of&nbsp;<em>Idol</em>&#8216;s changes for the upcoming <a href="https://www.etonline.com/luke-bryan-says-he-and-lionel-richie-dont-know-if-theyll-return-for-american-idols-new-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s been something Disney been really tightlipped about with me and Lionel and [host]&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/ryan-seacrest-leaving-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan [Seacrest]</a>. We currently haven&#8217;t heard what the story is on who&#8217;s coming back, and if Lionel and I are coming back. I think Disney is just trying to figure out what they want to do and we&#8217;re just kind of sitting back and waiting until they decide.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-luke-bryan-may-actually-want-out-of-idol">Luke Bryan May Actually Want Out Of &#8216;Idol&#8217; </h2>



<p>After the news of Katy leaving dropped, fans started circulating another interview Luke gave to <a href="https://www.etonline.com/luke-bryan-reveals-getaway-plan-with-wife-caroline-after-busy-year-exclusive-206229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Entertainment Tonight</em></a>&nbsp;in June 2023.</p>



<p>He confessed that he didn&#8217;t have a great work-life balance, especially when it comes to spending time with his wife and kids. </p>



<p>“I’m not really balancing it that well this year,” he shared. Referring to his wife, he added, “I’m like, ‘Baby, this is a rough year, let’s just get through it and then we’ll find a boat and go to the Caribbean or something.&#8217;”</p>



<p>As the rumor behind Katy&#8217;s exit suggests that she is hoping to have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/katy-perry-baby-number-2-american-idol-departure-orlando-bloom-family-career/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another baby with Orlando Bloom</a>, some are wondering if the same could be said of Luke.</p>



<p>So, maybe he&#8217;s ready to leave the show to spend more time with his family? If it&#8217;s a good thing for him, then we want it for him!</p>

<p>When asked about it in 2023, he confessed his plan was to remain “real active” professionally heading into 2024. </p>



<p>But beyond that? All good things must come to an end, they say!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-lionel-richie-and-ryan-seacrest">What about Lionel Richie and Ryan Seacrest?</h2>



<p>Again, no official announcement has been made about anyone leaving the show.</p>



<p>Heck, ABC didn&#8217;t even confirm Katy was leaving &#8212; though since she made the announcement herself, it&#8217;s pretty much a done deal.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Despite Luke&#8217;s guessing, we think Lionel is pretty safe. As for Ryan Seacrest, with his new gig hosting <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/ryan-seacrest-wheel-of-fortune-salary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wheel of Fortune</a> on the horizon, there&#8217;s some noise that he could be leaving <em>American Idol</em> by the fall to focus on that.</p>



<p>Then again, the guy juggled two TV shows before, and they were on different coasts! (R.I.P <em>Kelly and Ryan</em>&#8230;)</p>



<p>Chances are, as long as <em>Idol</em> is on the air, Seacrest will be at the helm! </p>



<p>As for Luke, we hope whatever happens, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s right for everyone involved!</p>

<p>All across the country, plenty of observers are judging Carrie Underwood at the moment.</p>



<p>As they do so, a common question is now being asked:</p>



<p><strong>Will Carrie Underwood return next season to judge contestants on American Idol?</strong></p>

<p>The artist was chosen this week to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-trump-inauguration/">perform at Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration</a> on Monday, January 20&#8230; but instead of receiving messages of congratulations from folks around the nation, Underwood has instead received a great deal of backlash.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t need to delve into <em>why</em>, do we?</p>



<p>Donald Trump has been elected President on <em>two</em> separate occasions, yet he&#8217;s likely the most polarizing person on the planet &#8212; with many believing he&#8217;s a racist, a rapist, a fascist or some combination of all these things.</p>



<p>And the singer is clearly aware of some of the negative responses out there.</p>

<p>“I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-im-not-maga-i-just-love-america/">Underwood said in a statement</a> to People Magazine a couple days ago, adding:</p>



<p>“I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”</p>



<p>Back in January 2017, Trump was turned down by a number of musicians who were asked to fill a similar role at his first inauguration.</p>



<p>In the end, 3 Doors Down, Toby Keith, Big &amp; Rich and Jackie Evancho were among a number of stars who signed on to take part in this celebration of the transition of power.</p>

<p>According to the Sun, meanwhile, American Idol producers are &#8220;not happy&#8221; that Underwood has entered the political fray in any matter whatsoever.</p>



<p>But this doesn&#8217;t mean the celebrity is about to get the heave-ho.</p>



<p>“Carrie’s job is not in jeopardy,&#8221; an <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/13302962/carrie-underwood-future-american-idol-revealed-blindsided-inauguration/">insider told the aforementioned</a> publication, emphasizing there has been “no talks of firing her. She will continue her role as a judge.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-1024x682.jpg" alt="Carrie Underwood performs onstage for ATLive at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on October 21, 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia." class="wp-image-516648" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1750765080-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carrie Underwood performs on stage for ATLive at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on October 21, 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for ABA)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The source went on:</p>



<p>“It doesn’t conflict with any of her Idol taping dates and [the inauguration] is before this season airs, so it doesn’t go against anything in her contract.</p>



<p>“But there are producers that don’t approve and are worried.&#8221;</p>



<p>Why? Because there&#8217;s been social media talk of an American Idol boycott and because executives simply had no idea this was a possibility.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone at the show knew about Carrie singing at the inauguration ahead of it coming out, it caught them all off guard&#8230; They don’t want the show to get political, they want it to be an escape from that.&#8221; this person said.</p>



<p>The goal of American Idol is to focus on entertainment only, The Sun explains, adding that Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie and Ryan Seacrest are far from psyched over their colleague&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>Underwood will be joined by performers including Kid Rock, the Village People, Billy Ray Cyrus, Lee Greenwood, Rascal Flatts, Jason Aldean and more over the weekend and Monday as part of Trump‘s inauguration events in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>An eight-time Grammy winner, Underwood will sing “America The Beautiful” at the swearing-in ceremony&#8230; with accompaniment from the Armed Forces Chorus and the United States Naval Academy Glee Club.</p>

<p>When Clay Aiken disses the current <em>Idol </em>judges, it&#8217;s not for the reasons that you might imagine.</p>



<p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/katy-perry-american-idol-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>American Idol</em> judges</a> have been more of a focus than the talent competition&#8217;s contestants.</p>



<p>However, the tone is very different from decades past. We&#8217;ve seen cringe moments go viral, but where is the abject cruelty?</p>



<p>Clay Aiken knows what it&#8217;s like to be on the receiving end of harsh criticism from <em>Idol </em>judges. And he thinks that the show was better for it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Clay Aiken on October 26, 2019." class="wp-image-513794" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1122_clayaiken_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clay Aiken attends the 2019 Politicon at Music City Center on October 26, 2019.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Ed Rode/Getty Images for Politicon)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-clay-aiken-dissing-current-american-idol-judges">Why is Clay Aiken dissing current &#8216;American Idol&#8217; judges?</h2>



<p>In 2003, Clay Aiken was a finalist in <em>American Idol</em>&#8216;s second season. He lost to Ruben Studdard that year, but managed to become one of the series&#8217; most famous alums.</p>



<p>These days, <em>Idol </em>is significantly less culturally relevant. The same might be said of Aiken himself, whose <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/11/clay-aiken-loses-congressional-bid-announces-return-to-televisio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed political career</a> and music hiatus have made him into something of a blast from the past.</p>



<p>However, he&#8217;s coming out with a Christmas album. That&#8217;s perfectly targeted at people who were watching <em>Idol </em>then or now. He&#8217;s also sharing his thoughts on what the show has become.</p>

<p>Speaking to <em>E! News</em>, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410212/clay-aiken-calls-out-current-american-idol-judges-for-being-too-nice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clay Aiken dissed</a> the current generation of American Idol judges.</p>



<p>“They don&#8217;t even give them anything constructive,” Aiken griped.</p>



<p>He characterized the judges&#8217; reactions: “It&#8217;s just like, ‘That was great. That was wonderful.’ Well, what are you there for then?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-clay-aiken-want-idol-judges-to-be-mean">Why does Clay Aiken want &#8216;Idol&#8217; judges to be mean?</h2>



<p>“I mean we could save so much time,” Aiken suggested, recommending that the series cut empty praise from the panel of judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Carrie Underwood.</p>



<p>“And we could sell like 50 more ads,&#8221; he quipped cynically, &#8220;if we just cut out the three minutes after every performance where we listen to three people say, ‘That was wonderful. You are a star.’”</p>



<p>He explained that he believes that the famously harsh critiques that he received from <em>Idol </em>judges helped him to improve.</p>

<p>“I grew from the criticisms &#8212; many of them not all of them,” admitted Clay Aiken. “I grew from the critiques that we got when I was on the show.&#8221;</p>



<p>He opined: &#8220;And I think that the show was at its best when it did help people get better. I tried to improve every week because of what I was told.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to Aiken, who sometimes <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/09/clay-aiken-slams-hacked-celebrities-they-deserve-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says unkind things</a> himself: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we do anyone a service when we just tell them that they&#8217;re great, and don&#8217;t tell them what they could do better at.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-does-have-positive-things-to-say-about-his-own-career">He does have positive things to say about his own career</h2>



<p>“I realized that I could do more to improve people&#8217;s lives by singing than I ever was going to be able to do in in the political world,” Clay Aiken claimed, promoting his Christmas album with an absurd line.</p>



<p>“Going into something that I think has the potential to make people happier, Christmas made sense, right?&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Because I&#8217;m cheesy already as a person.”</p>



<p>Clay Aiken appeared on <em>Idol </em>when our culture valued cruelty much more than it does now. Just because that experience molded him doesn&#8217;t mean that others would be better off for it.</p>

<p>Can Katy Perry return to <em>American Idol</em> after ditching the show?</p>



<p>Katy Perry quit <em>American Idol</em>. Though she wasn&#8217;t necessarily producers&#8217; first choice, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/carrie-underwood-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Underwood stepped up</a> to replace her at the judges table.</p>



<p>However, Katy&#8217;s new album has been an absolute flop, almost universally panned by critics.</p>



<p>With her comeback having blown up in her face, can Katy get back to the steady, extravagant pay of <em>American Idol</em>?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Katy Perry on September 26, 2024." class="wp-image-511478" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katy Perry attends the media call for the AFL 2024 Telstra Pre-Game Entertainment at Melbourne Cricket Ground on September 26, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Sam Tabone/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-katy-perry-return-to-american-idol-after-her-album-flopped">Can Katy Perry return to &#8216;American Idol&#8217; after her album flopped?</h2>



<p>From Season 16 through Season 22, Katy Perry was one of the celebrity judges on <em>American Idol</em>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/05/whoopi-goldberg-says-american-idol-sparked-the-downfall-of-society-appears-to-be-serious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial</a> and widely lampooned talent competition paid Perry 8 figures per season. Katy&#8217;s participation was, perhaps, a little cringe to many of her current and former fans, but she made off like a bandit.</p>



<p>Part of the reason for her departure was her new music. How did that go?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="769" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-769x1024.jpg" alt="Katy Perry on September 30, 2024." class="wp-image-511479" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-225x300.jpg 225w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-1537x2048.jpg 1537w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-546x728.jpg 546w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-721x960.jpg 721w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-811x1080.jpg 811w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-901x1200.jpg 901w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_02-scaled.jpg 1921w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katy Perry attends the Balenciaga Paris Womenswear Spring-Summer 2025 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on September 30, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Arnold Jerocki/Getty Images for Balenciaga)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this is the first that you&#8217;ve heard of Katy Perry&#8217;s album, <em>143</em>, well &#8230; there&#8217;s a reason for that.</p>



<p><em>143 </em>was a flop. It was not merely a financial disappointment, but has also been widely panned by music critics as, among other things, &#8220;creatively stagnant.&#8221; Ouch!</p>



<p>There was also controversy surrounding the album. Memorably, Katy Perry essentially ignored questions about her decision to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/katy-perry-dr-luke-timeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work with Dr. Luke</a>. In case anyone needs a refresher, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/10/pink-dr-luke-is-a-scumbag-and-im-glad-hes-getting-sued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that&#8217;s gross</a> &#8212; even when likable, popular musicians do it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-1024x683.jpg" alt="Katy Perry on September 11, 2024." class="wp-image-511480" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_03-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katy Perry attends the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards at UBS Arena on September 11, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-katy-perry-can-t-come-crawling-back-to-american-idol">Now, Katy Perry can&#8217;t come crawling back to &#8216;American Idol&#8217;</h2>



<p>“<em>American Idol</em> was a safe, steady gig for Katy,” an inside source <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/katy-perry-scrambling-to-get-back-on-idol-after-album-flop-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characterized</a> to <em>Life &amp; Style</em>.</p>



<p>“Now that her album has flopped, she’s scrambling to reclaim her spot at the judges’ table,&#8221; the insider alleged.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s a clear sign even she knows her days as a chart topping artist are behind her,&#8221; the source then shaded.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-720x1024.jpg" alt="Katy Perry on September 9, 2024." class="wp-image-511481" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-720x1024.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-211x300.jpg 211w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-768x1092.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-1440x2048.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-675x960.jpg 675w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-760x1080.jpg 760w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-844x1200.jpg 844w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_04-scaled.jpg 1801w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katy Perry attends the 2024 Kering for Women dinner at The Pool on September 09, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But Carrie’s got the gig now,&#8221; the insider pointed out. Notably, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/carrie-underwood-face-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Underwood</a> is a Country artist. </p>



<p>A number of talent competitions are <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/the-voice-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaning into Country</a> in order to cater to the tastes of their audiences. <em>American Idol </em>is only the latest to do so.</p>



<p>&#8220;And unless the new season is a ratings disaster,&#8221; the insider predicted, &#8220;there’s no way Katy is getting back in that chair!”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-1024x683.jpg" alt="Katy Perry on September 28, 2024." class="wp-image-511482" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1021_katyperry_05-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katy Perry performs before the AFL Grand Final match between Sydney Swans and Brisbane Lions at Melbourne Cricket Ground, on September 28, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Daniel Pockett/AFL Photos/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-her">What&#8217;s next for her?</h2>



<p><em>143 </em>may have been a flop and a career low point (so far) for Katy Perry, but it&#8217;s not an unlucky number. She&#8217;s sold 143 million units worldwide and has been a tremendously successful recording artist.</p>



<p>So while Katy Perry doesn&#8217;t have any Grammy Awards, she does have a tremendous fortune. Her hundreds of millions make her one of the world&#8217;s wealthiest musicians.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure that Katy Perry would prefer to have a steady stream of income. But we&#8217;re also confident that she and her famously handsome husband, Orlando Bloom, will be just fine without a Katy Perry <em>American Idol</em> comeback.</p>

<p>Carrie Underwood is returning to <em>American Idol.</em></p>



<p>The search for Katy Perry’s replacement is over, as the season 4 winner of the beloved reality competition show has been confirmed as the next member of the judging panel. </p>



<p>With so many high profile names being floated around to replace Katy, there’s a nice sort of symmetry in Carrie taking the role.</p>



<p>But what about the rest of the panel?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-carrie-underwood-replaces-katy-perry-on-american-idol">Carrie Underwood Replaces Katy Perry On &#8216;American Idol&#8217;</h2>



<p>According to <em>Deadline</em>, who was the first to report the news, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/carrie-underwood-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol-1236028161/#recipient_hashed=49bbb90ef70860c6d66c2236fcc42d2553a87206d049dc89dd6f450cda855393&amp;recipient_salt=e497a1d6b99d0571230fd256d8f21eb2f1e89d3a4139e8e3d2b2c43e7524ba0a&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Deadline_BreakingNews&amp;utm_content=540600_07-31-2024&amp;utm_term=19096437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie is expected</a> to sit alongside Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan on the panel for Season 23.</p>



<p>There was concern that, after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/katy-perry-pregnant-baby-number-2-american-idol-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy&#8217;s unexpected exit</a> from the show last season, ABC would <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/luke-bryan-leaving-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fire Luke</a> and Lionel and start fresh with a whole new panel of judges.</p>



<p>However, so far, that doesn’t seem to be the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it isn’t a done deal quite yet. According to sources that spoke to <em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/07/31/carrie-underwood-close-deal-katy-perry-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a></em>, Carrie and her team are in the final stages of locking her into a contract.</p>



<p>In other words, nailing down her salary and how long they’ll contract her for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, ABC’s<em> Good Morning America</em> additionally announced the news on Thursday, Aug 1 that Carrie would be joining the show, one day before Carrie is set to perform for the show&#8217;s concert series. </p>



<p>Again, love the symmetry; what a great place to make the official announcement!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-other-choices">The Other Choices</h2>



<p>For months, the debate over who should replace Katy Perry on Idol has raged on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were so many names being tossed around, it was honestly hard to keep track!&nbsp;</p>



<p>At one point, Luke Bryan hinted that an all-male panel might be in the works, with Justin Bieber joining the show. THere was also talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jelly-roll-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jelly Roll</a> completing the trio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Names like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/miley-cyrus-is-idol-producers-first-choice-to-replace-katy-perry-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miley Cyrus</a>, Pink, Meghan Trainor, and even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/taylor-swift-should-replace-katy-perry-on-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> were all being tossed around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the one many folks were really hoping for was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/adeles-replacing-katy-perry-on-american-idol-rumor-has-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adele</a>. As she’s set to wrap up her Las Vegas residency in the fall, the timing would’ve been perfect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, it would’ve kept her in the spotlight with enough time to work on new music if she wanted to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then again, that’s supposedly the reason Katy Perry left the show, so who knows!</p>

<p>Could Miley Cyrus wind up taking Katy Perry&#8217;s place on <em>American Idol</em>?</p>



<p>Yes, as you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/katy-perry-pregnant-baby-number-2-american-idol-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy is ending her time on <em>Idol</em></a>, and the hunt for a suitable replacement has kicked into high gear.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/miley-cyrus-is-1st-choice-to-replace-katy-on-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life &amp; Style</a></em>, Miley is producers&#8217; &#8220;first choice&#8221; for the job. But there&#8217;s a problem.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="728" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-1024x728.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus attends the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California." class="wp-image-504319" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-1024x728.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-300x213.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-768x546.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-2048x1455.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-960x682.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-1080x768.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1986573144-1200x853.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Miley Cyrus attends the 66th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 04, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-miley-cyrus-be-able-to-reach-a-deal-with-american-idol-producers">Will Miley Cyrus Be Able to Reach a Deal With American Idol Producers?</h2>



<p>Apparently, Katy received a massive salary for her work on the show.</p>



<p>And with ratings on a slight decline, <em>Idol</em> producers were hoping to shell out slightly less money for their next judge.</p>



<p>But Miley won&#8217;t come cheap, and it&#8217;s possible that her salary demands will prevent this deal from happening.</p>



<p>“The big issue hanging over Katy’s mostly successful run on <em>Idol</em> has been the enormous paycheck she managed to negotiate from the start of her judging term that only increased incrementally in the years since,” a source tells <em>Life &amp; Style</em>. </p>

<p></p>



<p>“With Katy finally getting back to making music full-time, Disney and ABC are looking to replace her with just as famous a name at a somewhat discounted price.”</p>



<p>Miley isn&#8217;t too thrilled about being the discount option. </p>



<p>But the source says she&#8217;s very much interested in joining <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/luke-bryan-leaving-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Bryan</a> and Lionel Richie at the judges&#8217; table next season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-american-idol-afford-miley">Can American Idol Afford Miley?</h2>



<p>“Miley really does love the competition space,” the insider says. </p>



<p>“She has a lot more fun judging and mentoring than she has in her various forays into acting as an adult. And she also knows her fans actually show up to watch her on these shows.”</p>



<p>Yes, Miley fans will check out any show that she&#8217;s a part of. And that loyalty could serve as a powerful bargaining chip in her upcoming negotiations.</p>



<p>“That’s really her secret weapon in extracting a big fee from Disney and ABC,” the insider says. </p>

<p>“Miley’s been in this situation before and she knows how to make it work in her favor,&#8221; the source continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;The only thing that’s keeping the two sides apart at the moment is Miley’s fee, but she is absolutely the first choice to replace Katy in this franchise.”</p>

<p>Of course, <em>Idol</em> producers are not without options.</p>



<p>As we&#8217;ve previously discussed, many fans of the show think that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/adeles-replacing-katy-perry-on-american-idol-rumor-has-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adele should replace Katy</a>.</p>



<p>And of course, there&#8217;s a sizable contingent that believes Katy&#8217;s former rival <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/taylor-swift-should-replace-katy-perry-on-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift should be the next Idol judge</a>.</p>



<p>But both of those options would probably be even more expensive. </p>



<p>And while Adele and Taylor both have pipes, few modern entertainers can top Miley when it comes to personality and camera presence.</p>

<p>Adele is poised to be the next judge on <em>American Idol</em>, replacing <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-wedding-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Perry</a>. </p>



<p>After her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/katy-perry-leaving-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise announcement</a> that she would be bowing out after this season, Katy has kept a tight lip on who would be filling her seat between Luke Bryan and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/sofia-richie-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lionel Richie</a>. </p>



<p>Of course, it may just be that she isn&#8217;t privy to the conversation &#8211; a conversation that&#8217;s already thrown around names like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jelly-roll-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jelly Roll</a> and Fantasia Barrino. </p>



<p>But now there&#8217;s a rumor picking up steam and fan support. Say hello &#8230; to Adele. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-adele-replacing-katy-perry-is-perfect-timing-and-casting-for-idol">Why Adele Replacing Katy Perry Is Perfect Timing and Casting For &#8216;Idol&#8217;</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it: there isn&#8217;t a female pop icon who hasn&#8217;t hosted one a singing competition series in the last decade. Britney, Mariah, Christina &#8211; even <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/taylor-swift-should-replace-katy-perry-on-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> made time to guest mentor on <em>The Voice</em> five years ago. </p>



<p>So, there&#8217;s obviously no fear that judging <em>American Idol</em> is a step down. On the contrary, it&#8217;s a perfect career move for someone who might, oh you know, looking to slow down and have another kid!</p>



<p>Yes, while the rumor is Katy&#8217;s leaving the show to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/katy-perry-pregnant-baby-number-2-american-idol-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expand her family </a>and reignite her music career, Adele might be taking the job for the exact same reason!</p>



<p>“Adele has been focusing on having <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/adele-pregnant-baby-2-girl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a baby</a> with Rich [Paul, her boyfriend of three years], but she doesn’t want to be touring at the same time,” a source told <em><a href="https://heatworld.com/celebrity/news/adele-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heat World</a></em>, a UK-based magazine. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="715" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508-1024x715.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-501020" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508-768x536.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508-960x670.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508-1080x754.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149763508.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Luke Bryan, Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Ryan Seacrest attend the &#8220;American Idol&#8221; Season 22 Top 10 Event at The Aster on April 22, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It takes a lot out of her and she’s looking at gigs that would get her the same pay cheque, but with less work involved, as she wants to get pregnant soon. Her team were still shocked when she said she was interested in doing TV work and that she had her eye on Katy’s spot on <em>American Idol</em>.”</p>



<p>Hey, better to have a steady incoming than be chasing pavements? (How many song titles have you noticed so far, btw?)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adele-has-an-in-as-katy-s-her-friend-and-neighbor">Adele Has An In As Katy&#8217;s Her Friend and Neighbor</h2>



<p>Now, if the studio is keen to have someone like you, Katy Perry, than Adele is a perfect choice. And, if Adele really wants the job, she&#8217;d likely have Katy in her corner. </p>



<p>The female superstars are actually neighbors, living in the same &#8216;hood in Los Angeles. Because of that, they&#8217;ve been friends for years, which means Katy could put a good word in for Adele. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-501021" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150184995.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Katy Perry attends the 35th Annual Colleagues Spring Luncheon &amp; Oscar de la Renta Fashion Show at Beverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel on April 25, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The timing also couldn&#8217;t be more perfect. Her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/adele-cancels-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Weekends with Adele </em>Las Vegas residency</a> is coming to a close, and once the show is water under the bridge, she&#8217;ll be working on new music and new addition to the family. </p>



<p>“Once I am done with all my obligations and all of my shows, I want to have a baby,” Adele told her audience at a recent show. She even knows exactly what she wants. </p>



<p>“I want a girl because I’ve already got a boy,” Adele shared.</p>



<p>Well, here&#8217;s hoping the one and only Adele gets everything she wants in the upcoming year. And if that includes replacing Katy Perry on <em>American Idol</em>, well, it&#8217;s better than turning tables.</p>



<p>(Ok, that was a lazy easter egg, but couldn&#8217;t help it. It&#8217;s a favorite!)</p>

<p>It took three hours on an emotional and pulsating finale.</p>



<p>Not to mention an endless string of performances by a number of aspiring and talented artists.</p>



<p>But American Idol finally crowned its latest champion on Sunday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/American_Idol_GettyImages-2153264362_1280.webp" alt="American Idol Season 22 finalists" class="wp-image-500261" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/American_Idol_GettyImages-2153264362_1280.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/American_Idol_GettyImages-2153264362_1280-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/American_Idol_GettyImages-2153264362_1280-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/American_Idol_GettyImages-2153264362_1280-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/American_Idol_GettyImages-2153264362_1280-960x540.webp 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">American Idol Season 22 finalists on stage.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Disney/Christopher Willard)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>With finalists Jack Blocker, Abi Carter and Will Moseley <em>all</em> giving it their all to close out Season 22, the votes were tallied to finish off the aforementioned finale and the winner was announced as&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230; <strong>ABI CARTER</strong>!</p>



<p>Abi took to the stage several times during Sunday&#8217;s episode, truly cementing her victory with her final performance in which she sang her original tune, as well as a rendition of Bon Jovi&#8217;s &#8220;Bed of Roses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moseley finished second and Blocker came in third.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I didn&#8217;t feel real until coming on this carpet and then talking with people has made me feel real again,&#8221; <a href="https://www.etonline.com/american-idol-crowns-new-champion-for-season-22-find-out-who-won-225752">Carter told Entertainment Tonight</a> after learning the amazing news. </p>

<p>The finale featured performances by such huge names as Jon Bon Jovi, Fantasia Barrino, Jason Mraz, Wynonna Judd, Seal and New Kids on the Block.</p>



<p>In a pre-recorded video, Billie Eilish even appearance sans said the following to Carter: </p>



<p>&#8220;I wish you nothing but the best. I&#8217;m here to support you, and I love ya.&#8221;</p>



<p>Carter then fell to the floor in shock, which is pretty much how we&#8217;d react if Eilish ever sent us a similar video.</p>

<p>This episode, meanwhile, also marked the end of Katy Perry&#8217;s run as an American Idol judge.</p>



<p>As we hold out hope that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/jelly-roll-replacing-katy-perry-american-idol/">Jelly Roll takes her place</a>, the pop singer has sounded ready to move on for a little while now.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean I love Idol so much,&#8221; Perry, who shares three-year-old daughter Daisy Dove with fiancé Orlando Bloom, said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in February. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s connected me with like the heart of America, but I feel like I need to go out and feel that pulse, that pulse to my own beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perry has also big a huge fan of Carter&#8217;s throughout the winner&#8217;s journey, prompting Abi to say after the concluding show:</p>



<p>&#8220;Katy Perry has just taken me under her wing in a little way, and I felt so honored.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s such a legend and to have somebody that has so much experience in this industry be able to look at me and be like, &#8216;I have faith in you,&#8217; that&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Congratulations to Abi Carter and all of this year&#8217;s contestants!</strong></p>
