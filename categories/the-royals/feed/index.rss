<p>Back in 2023, the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry&#8217;s debut memoir </a>created quite a stir within royal circles.</p>



<p>The book, titled <em>Spare</em>, contained many surprising revelations about Harry&#8217;s childhood and early adult years.</p>



<p>But it was not as critical of the other members of the royal family as some readers had expected and &#8212; in many cases &#8212; hoped.</p>



<p>Still, it seems that Harry&#8217;s brother and sister-in-law are so offended by the very existence of the book that they refuse to give it a chance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-and-william-reportedly-refuse-to-read-harry-s-book">Kate and William reportedly refuse to read Harry&#8217;s book</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-14522965/Royal-Family-thought-hearing-Prince-Harry-memoir-called-Spare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to</a> a recent biography of King Charles by royal expert Robert Hardman, neither Will nor Kate has read Harry&#8217;s memoir.</p>



<p>And it seems that neither of them has any intention of doing so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither of them read it. He is a grown-up, 40-year-old with the BBC app on his phone so he knows what it says,&#8221; one palace insider remarked. &#8220;But he has people like me to tell him what else he needs to know. We gave him the key points.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are spearheading a new campaign called Heads Together in partnership with inspiring charities, which aims to change the national conversation on mental wellbeing." class="wp-image-522982" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are spearheading a new campaign called Heads Together in partnership with inspiring charities, which aims to change the national conversation on mental wellbeing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Nicky J Sims/Getty Images for Royal Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the book may not have proved as damaging as some royals feared, it still generated a good deal of controversy at a very vulnerable time for the royals (it hit stores just months after the death of Queen Elizabeth II).</p>



<p>Hardman says the royals cryptically referred to bad press from overseas as &#8220;headwinds that we face from across the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was one way of describing an extraordinary 12-week run of non-stop disobliging headlines and combative allegations, all of them entirely beyond the control of the King and his staff. Storm-force gales might have been a better metaphor,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weathering-the-storm">Weathering the storm </h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1060279056-4-1024x685.jpg" alt="Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend a service marking the centenary of WW1 armistice at Westminster Abbey on November 11, 2018 in London, England.

<p>Hardman added that despite the challenges presented by the book&#8217;s publication, the lasting impact was negligible.</p>



<p>&#8220;That this should all be unfolding in the first phase of a new reign might once have been considered disastrous. However, there were two unexpected aspects to these ‘headwinds’ which would work in Charles III’s favour,&#8221; he explained, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;First, the constant diet of extraneous negativity, though awkward and at times embarrassing, made very little impact, according to polls, on public attitudes towards the monarchy. Second, it appeared to have no discernible impact on the King himself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, there are still concerns about Harry&#8217;s literary career, due mainly to the fact that &#8220;large chunks of more recent events&#8221; were left out of Spare.</p>



<p>&#8220;This suggested either a sequel or, perhaps, a memoir by Meghan in due course,&#8221; Hardman wrote.</p>



<p>There has been talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/meghan-markle-tell-all-memoir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan writing a memoir</a> of her own. But considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-hates-america-and-should-self-deport-conservative-group-argues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s book almost got him deported</a>, we&#8217;re guessing he&#8217;s content to focus on other pursuits for a while.</p>

<p>We have some terrible news to report regarding a woman who has already lived an incredible difficult life.</p>



<p>Virginia Giuffre first made headlines when she publicly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/02/queen-elizabeth-ii-covid-diagnosis-andrew-scandal-prompt-concern/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault</a>.</p>



<p>Now, she&#8217;s revealed that she has just four days to live after being badly injured in a car accident.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-31-at-1.44.10%E2%80%AFPM-1024x519.png" alt="Virginia Giuffre tells her story during an interview with the BBC." class="wp-image-522503"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Virginia Giuffre tells her story during an interview with the BBC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (BBC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-virginia-giuffre-claims-doctors-have-given-her-four-days-to-live">Virginia Giuffre claims doctors have given her four days to live</h2>



<p>In an Instagram post that appeared online earlier today, Virginia stunned her followers by revealing that she does not expect to live out the week.</p>



<p>She explained that she&#8217;s in renal failure after nearly being killed in a head-on collision.</p>



<p>&#8220;This year has been the worst start to a new year, but I won’t bore anyone with the details but I think it important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving 110km as we were slowing for a turn that no matter what your car is made of it might as well be a tin can,&#8221; Giuffre captioned the photo below, in which she appears to have suffered serious head injuries.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve gone into kidney renal failure, they’ve given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes,&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;S&#8211;T in one hand and wish in the other &amp; I guarantee it&#8217;s still going to be s&#8211;t at the end of the day. Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life. Godbless you all xx Virginia.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s good news, however, as members of Virginia&#8217;s family expressed hope that she might pull through.</p>



<p>&#8220;Virginia my daughter, I love you and praying for you to get the correct treatment to live a long and healthy life. If there is anything in this world I can do to help you, please let me know. My spirit with you now and holding your hand,&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DH0vvDKzDvu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her father commented on the post</a>.</p>

<p>Giuffre says that she met the infamous sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort. She claims that Epstein introduced her to Andrew in 1999, while she was still in her teens.</p>

<p>Giuffre alleges that Andrew forced her to have sex with him three times between 1999 and 2002.</p>



<p>After Virginia came forward, a photo showing her and Epstein standing alongside his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, circulated online.</p>



<p>She told the <em><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article219494920.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami Herald</a></em> that Epstein lost interest in her in 2003, when she was 20, because she was &#8220;too old.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/07/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epsteins-confidante-arrested-by-fbi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence</a> on sex trafficking charges.</p>



<p>Andrew has not been charged with any crime, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/09/prince-andrew-to-face-sexual-assault-accuser-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giuffre did file a civil suit against him</a> in 2021.</p>



<p>After months of legal wrangling, the two parties reached a settlement “in principle” in early 2022. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Kate Middleton has shared a new message in honor of Mother&#8217;s Day in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>The parent of three &#8212; who shares Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6, with Prince William &#8212; marked this occasion on March 30 with a touching tribute to Mother Nature.</p>



<p>In doing so, she also acknowledged the journey she has been on for the past many months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over the past year, nature has been our sanctuary,&#8221; Princess Kate captioned her Instagram post, which featured a video comprised various outdoor scenes.</p>



<p>This is a clear reference to Middleton having battled some form of cancer since around this same time in 2024.</p>



<p>Thankfully, as we learned in January, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-says-shes-in-remission-from-cancer-one-year-after-starting-treatment/">Royal Beauty is now in remission</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This Mother’s Day, let us celebrate Mother Nature and recognize how our bond with the natural world can help not only nurture our inner selves, but remind us too of the role we play within the rich tapestry of life,&#8221; Middleton continued, concluding the post with her first initial, <em>C</em>.</p>

<p>In the social media montage, Middleton donning a patterned beige dress and touching a tree as the sunlight surrounds her. </p>



<p>In another moment caught on camera, someone who appears to be her husband, walks through tall grass with their dogs at his heels. </p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s kids are not included, out of respect for their privacy we&#8217;re assuming.</p>



<p>This latest The tribute to nature comes after Kate’s controversial 2024 Mother’s Day post, which she later confessed to altering after keen observers noticed some strange details.</p>

<p>Back then, the beloved princess shared a snapshot of herself sitting and smiling next to her three children. </p>



<p>As the picture made its way around the internet, many observers noticed some oddities &#8212; including Charlotte and Louis appearing blurry, Kate’s zipper looking edited and her hair seemingly being airbrushed.</p>



<p>“Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,” Middleton subsequently wrote to explain what transpired. </p>



<p>“I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused.</p>



<p>The statement did little to shut down the speculation that the Royal Family was hiding something&#8230; especially because Middleton had undergone abdominal surgery in January 2024 and had retreated from the public eye during her recovery. </p>



<p>At the time, she wasn’t scheduled to attend any public events until after Easter.</p>



<p>Kate was then forced to tell the world about her cancer diagnosis <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-cancer-treatment-complete-video/">and eventual treatment</a>.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since.</p>



<p>Middleton has recently been seen out and about, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kate-middleton-drinks-guinness-makes-post-cancer-return-to-st-patricks-day-festivities/">even drinking beer</a>.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is one of the most famous women on the planet. But she&#8217;s got an army of haters, and unlike some A-list celebs, her defenders are not quite as outspoken.</p>



<p>Thanks to her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix series</a> and housewares brand, the Duchess of Sussex is finally making a name for herself as a lifestyle guru, but her success has attracted a new level of criticism.</p>



<p>These days, high-profile media figures are dunking on Meghan, a trend that seems to stem from the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-netflix-show-is-awful-should-end-the-career-of-thirsty-star-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative response to her show</a>.</p>

<p>Now, in a move that would&#8217;ve been unimaginable just a few years ago, former Meghan and Harry ally Graydon Carter is roasting the duchess at every opportunity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graydon-carter-blasts-meghan-markle-with-literary-zinger">Graydon Carter blasts Meghan Markle with literary zinger</h2>



<p>In a new conversation with <em><a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/graydon-carter-on-guest-lists-dress-codes-and-meghan-markle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview</a></em> magazine, the former <em>Vanity Fair</em> editor labeled Meghan the “Undine Spragg of Montecito.”</p>



<p>The comment refers to the main character in Edith Wharton&#8217;s 1913 novel <em>The Custom of the Country</em>. And it&#8217;s not meant as a compliment.</p>



<p>Undine Spragg is a conniving, hyper-ambitious woman who marries and divorces several times in an effort to secure the wealth and position she covets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26950.The_Custom_of_the_Country?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads</a> describes her as &#8220;a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating&#8221;  and one who engages in &#8220;social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-custom-of-the-country/characters/undine-spragg#:~:text=Undine%20Spragg%20is%20the%20daughter,society%20in%20New%20York%20City." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LitCharts</a> “feels little satisfaction in achieving her goals and often finds herself haunted by her failures.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, that&#8217;s not the kind of character you want to be compared to. And that&#8217;s not the only time that Carter has taken a shot at Meghan in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Meghan appeared on the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em> in 2017. Carter claims he never heard her name until the day when one of his colleagues suggested her as a cover model.</p>



<p>“Jane Sarkin, who booked our covers, came in and said, ‘We should do a cover on Meghan Markle,’” he recently told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/24/royal-family/meghan-markle-thought-she-landed-vanity-fair-cover-for-charity-work-not-prince-harry-relationship-ex-editor-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“I said, ‘I have no idea what that is, why should we do a story on her?’” Carter asked.</p>



<p>“So she said, ‘Because she’s going to marry Prince Harry.’”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain's Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary." class="wp-image-522389" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2151923812-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looks on as she attends a Sit Out with Britain&#8217;s Prince Harry (unseen), Duke of Sussex, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters in Abuja on May 11, 2024 as they visit Nigeria as part of celebrations of Invictus Games anniversary.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by KOLA SULAIMON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Carter says Meghan became irate when she learned that the magazine was more interested in her love life than her charity work.</p>



<p>“Excuse me, Is this going to all be about Prince Harry? Because I thought we were going to be talking about my charities and my philanthropy,&#8221; Meghan allegedly complained.</p>



<p>“This woman is slightly adrift on the facts and reality,” Carter noted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-graydon-carter-says-princess-di-would-not-be-team-meghan">Graydon Carter says Princess Di would not be Team Meghan</h2>



<p>Carter was a longtime friend of Princess Diana&#8217;s, and he also shared his thoughts on what Di might think of Harry&#8217;s wife.</p>



<p>“I would think she would feel great sorrow for her son to have been pulled away from his family like this, especially his brother but also his father,” he said. “Anytime someone comes between siblings, that’s a disaster, horrible for a family.”</p>



<p>So, yeah. Meghan probably isn&#8217;t thrilled with Graydon Carter at the moment.</p>

<p>Prince Harry finds himself at the center of yet another controversy this week.</p>



<p>But in a refreshing change of pace, this one has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/gwyneth-paltrow-seems-to-mock-meghan-markle-in-shady-instagram-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Markle&#8217;s new career as a lifestyle influencer</a>.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, Harry has been active in humanitarian work throughout his adult life.</p>



<p>One of his earliest projects is the Sentebale organization, which Harry founded way back in 2006 in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-surprising-decision">Harry&#8217;s surprising decision</h2>



<p>And now, in a shocking turn of events, Harry and co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho have announced that they will both be stepping down from the organization.</p>



<p>The duo made their decision clear in a statement issued to the <em><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-harry-resign-charity-sentable-dps2tkq5n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London Times</a></em>. Harry said that he&#8217;s &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; to step away from the organization that&#8217;s meant so much to him, but says the current situation is “untenable situation” due to a conflict with Senetable chairwoman Dr. Sophie Chandauka and the board of trustees.</p>



<p>“What’s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this,&#8221; said Harry and Seeiso in a joint statement.</p>

<p>“With heavy hearts, we have resigned for our roles as patrons of the organization until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees,” they continued.</p>



<p>“It is devastating that the relationship between the charity’s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair.”</p>



<p>Harry and Seeiso explained that they will not cut ties with the charity entirely, explaining, “Although we may no longer be patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care.”</p>



<p>Sentebale, which helps children and adolescents struggling to come to terms with their HIV and AIDS diagnoses says it has not yet received formal “resignations from the royal patrons.&#8221;</p>

<p>“We are pleased to confirm the restructuring of our board on March 25, 2025, to introduce experts with the capabilities and networks to accelerate Sentebale’s transformation agenda as announced last year,” a rep for the organization told <em><a href="https://people.com/prince-harry-devastated-as-he-quits-african-charity-sentebale-founded-princess-diana-honor-11703464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>.</p>



<p>Details are scarce at the moment, and it sounds like distancing himself from the situation is the right call for Harry&#8217;s career and reputation.</p>



<p>Still, this is the latest in a long line of minor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-urged-to-leave-us-after-judge-orders-release-of-immigration-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR setbacks for Harry and Meghan</a>, and you can be sure that the Sussexes&#8217; harshest critics will seize on this opportunity to sling mud at the couple.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Well, apparently the fact that so many of them have cut ties with the Duke of Sussex tells us just about everything we need to know.</p>



<p>Yes, according to royal journalist Tom Quinn, the rumors of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/meghan-markle-prince-harry-losing-friends-in-la-amid-latest-pr-crises-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry getting dumped by his pals</a> are 100 percent true.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-turned-harry-woke-former-friends-allege">Meghan turned Harry &#8216;woke,&#8217; former friends allege</h2>



<p>These days, Quinn is promoting a new book titled <em>Yes Ma’am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants</em>. And he may have ruffled some feathers while promoting the tome in a new interview with Fox News.</p>



<p>“Meghan was blamed for … making Harry ‘too woke,’” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-blamed-by-prince-harrys-pals-making-him-too-woke-royal-exit-author" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quinn told the outlet</a> this week. </p>



<p>“One of Harry’s best friends said, ‘I can’t understand what Harry sees in her. She’s a tree hugger. She’s so woke.’ For Harry’s traditional friends, being woke was not a good thing,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;But I think Harry was, in a way, entranced by the fact that Meghan was able to offer him an alternative world from the one he’d always known.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-harry-s-friends">The beginning of the end for Harry&#8217;s friends</h2>



<p>Quinn went on to reveal that there was a specific incident that led to widespread discouragement among Harry&#8217;s closest friends.</p>



<p>“There’s a famous occasion where Meghan went with Harry and some of his friends from school and from the army — she went on a pheasant shoot at Sandringham, the royal family’s country home,” Quinn explained.</p>



<p>“She hated it because all of Harry’s friends were making the sorts of jokes that suggested they disliked everything to do with ‘woke.’ They made rude comments about tree-huggers. They just don’t like that kind of thing because, to a large extent, it’s seen as left-wing. They just didn’t like it.”</p>



<p>But while Harry&#8217;s friends seem to have assumed that he shifted his political beliefs in order to appease Meghan, Quinn notes that he may have found <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her views and beliefs</a> genuinely compelling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-new-beliefs">Harry&#8217;s new beliefs</h2>



<p>“With Meghan, [Harry] shifted across,” Quinn said. “He became much more sympathetic as she is about wanting to do good in the world. </p>



<p>&#8220;The idea of Harry being worried about those things before Meghan — it would never have occurred to him. I think Meghan really took him away from that [old] world, and they didn’t like that.”</p>



<p>Quinn&#8217;s book is primarily about the palace staff who serve the royals, so it should come as no surprise that one of the hottest Harry takes came from an employee.</p>

<p>“That terrible modern word ‘woke’ has often been used, and although I don’t like it, I can see why it is applied to Harry — he did become far more concerned about social issues and the rights of minorities than he’d ever been before Meghan’s arrival,” a former palace aide told Quinn.</p>



<p>The source added that Harry went from “being pretty easygoing” to being “more disgruntled” after he met Meghan.</p>



<p>Well, if he&#8217;s disgruntled, he&#8217;s certainly hiding it well. In most pics with Meghan, Harry looks to be happier than ever.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-urged-to-leave-us-after-judge-orders-release-of-immigration-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry deportation drama</a> continued this week, as conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation successfully pushed for the release of documents related to Harry&#8217;s visa.</p>
</p>
<p>But as many legal experts predicted, the docs were heavily redacted, and there was nothing in them that might lead to Harry being expelled from the US.</p>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, political opponents of the Duke of Sussex still want him out of the country.</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>And now that they can&#8217;t force the courts to do it (frankly, it was dumb that they ever thought they&#8217;d be able to), the haters are trying a more direct approach:</p>
</p>
<p>They&#8217;re directly encouraging Harry to uproot his family and move them halfway across the world as punishment for partying in his twenties.</p>
</p>
<p>(The Heritage group claims that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/its-meghan-markles-fault-that-prince-harry-might-get-deported-for-doing-drugs-royal-expert-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry should be deported for doing drugs</a> during a trip to the US many years ago, a lapse in judgment that he failed to disclose in his visa application.)</p>
</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heritage-foundation-lawyer-urges-harry-to-return-to-uk">Heritage Foundation lawyer urges Harry to return to UK</h2>
</p>
<p>Samuel Dewey, a lawyer for the Heritage Foundation, made his case against Harry in a new interview with the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14516167/Heritage-foundation-prince-harry-visa-lawsuit-hates-america-meghan-markle.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>.</p>

</p>
<p>He argued that Harry &#8220;really ought to go&#8221; due to his criticism of President Donald Trump.</p>
</p>
<p>Harry actually has <em>not</em> been a terribly vocal critic of the Trump administration, but Dewey points to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/prince-harry-shades-tf-out-of-donald-trump-hes-weak-and-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments the Duke made</a> about &#8220;weak moral character in the world&#8221; and alleges the remark was referring to the president.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in a country he clearly hates. He&#8217;s clearly furious at the American voters and attacking them for the result of the 2024 election. Harry should just go home,&#8221; Dewey added.</p>
</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dewey-says-harry-lied-about-past-drug-use-on-visa-application">Dewey says Harry lied about past drug use on visa application</h2>
</p>
<p>Despite recent free speech crackdowns in the US, it still remains very unlikely that a figure as prominent as Prince Harry would be deported for criticizing the president. Thus, the Heritage group has focused their argument on the claim that Harry lied about his past drug use when applying for a visa.</p>
</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1024x713.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-521782" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1080x752.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1-1200x836.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></p>

</p>
<p>&#8220;If Harry lied he should be prosecuted and deported if necessary,&#8221; says Dewey.</p>
</p>
<p>The lawyer goes on to claim that Harry received special treatment, a fact that he claims is evidenced by discrepancies in files held by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;d say I used drugs or was in on a diplomatic visa that would be in the DHS files,&#8221; Dewey claims.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you wouldn&#8217;t have this situation where the judge says I don&#8217;t have the full story. That&#8217;s what we read from these documents.&#8221;</p>

</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>This latest push to kick Harry out of the US comes on the heels of months of efforts to have his files made public.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;We would strongly urge President Trump and the new administration to release the records to the American people so they judge for themselves without relying on the interpretation of the Biden administration,&#8221; Heritage director Nile Gardiner wrote in a message to the White House.</p>
</p>
<p>In the end, those docs were as disappointing as the much-vaunted <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/19/jfk-files-release-what-we-learned-updates/82542231007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JFK files</a>, but the Heritage Foundation remains optimistic:</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing changes the big picture and I remain positive we will see Prince Harry&#8217;s full immigration records,&#8221; Gardiner added.</p>
</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p></p>

<p>Kate Middleton and Prince William have been going through <em><strong>it</strong></em> for awhile now.</p>
<p>There was Meghan Markle and Prince Harry defecting out of the family and the country&#8230; there was the COVID-19 pandemic&#8230; and most recently, of course, there was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-cancer-health-update/">Middleton&#8217;s cancer diagnosis</a> in early 2024.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that Prince Charles has also been diagnosed with this awful disease.</p>
<p>Such tumultuous events would be enough to tear nearly any couple apart, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>

<p>This hasn&#8217;t been the case for Middleton and William, however, according to Royal historian Amanda Foreman.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a sense of protectiveness and partnership,&#8221; Foreman says in the <a href="https://people.com/kate-middleton-prince-william-nightmare-5-years-exclusive-11699262">latest issue of People Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last five years have been a nightmare for them in every possible way &#8212; the past year even more so. That either crushes a marriage, or it brings them together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foreman emphasizes that the spouses are closer than ever these days, which is especially important because &#8220;the international stage is so unstable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither Kate nor William has said a ton in public about their relationship or the trials that have tested it of late.</p>
<p>But Middleton has completed her cancer treatments. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kate-middleton-drinks-guinness-makes-post-cancer-return-to-st-patricks-day-festivities/">She&#8217;s out there drinking beer</a>. We can all pray that the worst is behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult,” William said in November to reporters. </p>
<p>“I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done. But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.”</p>

<p>Middleton returned to her Royal duties after announcing in January that her cancer was in remission. </p>
<p>Prince William and his wife have remained mostly tight-lipped about their estranged relationship with Harry and Markle, choosing instead to focus on their own romance.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen more of the pair <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-go-full-on-pda-in-rare-valentines-day-photo/">acting all cute and cuddly</a> in public then ever before.</p>
<p>As you might expect these days, Kate and William are primarily focused on their children: Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6.</p>

<p>One year after Kate revealed to the world that she was sick, royal biographer Robert Hardman tells People: “There is definitely a feeling of resetting the dial &#8212; of being back.”</p>
<p>Adds Ailsa Anderson, a former press secretary to Queen Elizabeth: </p>
<p>“Fast-forward, and what a difference a year makes. She’s even more beloved in the nation’s hearts than she was.”</p>

<p>Meghan Markle is making headlines for her skills in the kitchen (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>And no, we&#8217;re not talking about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-uses-daughter-lilibet-to-promote-netflix-show-cant-do-anything-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan&#8217;s new Netflix cooking show</a>.</p>
<p>Despite mixed reviews and relatively low ratings (more on that later), the series has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renewed for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>The renewal was a much-needed win for Meghan following a rough 2024. But the reaction to the duchess&#8217; latest Instagram post probably dampened her celebratory mood.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1024x572.png" alt="Meghan Markle in a scene from her upcoming Netflix cooking show." class="wp-image-515840" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1024x572.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-2048x1145.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-960x537.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM-1080x604.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-02-at-2.03.23-PM.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle in a scene from her upcoming Netflix cooking show.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-gets-blasted-as-walking-scam-in-response-to-latest-post">Meghan gets blasted as &#8216;walking scam&#8217; in response to latest post</h2>
<p>Things started out innocently enough.</p>
<p>Meghan posted an Instagram Story in which she whipped up some green waffles for her kids in honor of St. Patrick&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>But viewers quickly noticed that the ridges on the waffle maker in Meghan&#8217;s video did not match up with those on the finished product.</p>
<p>So Meg&#8217;s latest bit of content might not have been completely authentic. That might not be such a big deal, were it not for the fact that authenticity and reliability are huge parts of Meghan&#8217;s public persona these days.</p>

<p>As she continues to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-launches-new-podcast-about-female-entrepreneurs-immediately-gets-roasted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roll out her new lifestyle brand</a>, Meghan is trying harder than ever to present herself as the kind of mom who can offer helpful tips and tricks to other moms.</p>
<p>But her waffle video did not move her closer to that goal. In fact, it had the opposite effect.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-haters-have-a-field-day">Meghan&#8217;s haters have a field day</h2>
<p>“Meghan Markle’s relentless compulsion to lie about everything is baffling—even over something as trivial as a waffle. She posted a video of herself using a waffle maker with a divider, yet the so-called ‘homemade’ waffle she presented looked exactly like a store-bought one, missing the dividers that should have been there,” one viewe wrote on X, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/18/royal-family/fans-accuse-meghan-markle-of-faking-activity-with-kids-for-social-media-shes-a-walking-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t be surprising at all! The effort she puts into staging even the simplest things is almost impressive. Imagine going through all that just to fake a waffle — it’s like she can’t help herself,” a second person agreed.</p>

<p>“She didn’t fresh make them for her kids. She used these frozen waffles,” a third chimed in, along with a photo from the Kellogg’s that they say Meghan stole for her Story. “Why the big deal? Because her post is showing she made it all from scratch. She is a total manipulative liar. About everything.”</p>
<p>“I immediately saw the difference when I saw the video. I couldn’t grasp the reason to lie about waffles. What kind of person needs to do that? Meghan Markle is a walking scam,” a fourth added.</p>
<p>Obviously, the commentary is unnecessarily harsh, but sadly, that&#8217;s par for the course with Meghan.</p>
<p>The truth is, she probably did cut come corners while putting her latest video together. But clearly, the harshest criticism is coming from people who already hated her for some absolutely unhinged reason.</p></p>

<p>In his 2023 memoir, <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/prince-harry-cops-to-tender-penis-while-attending-brothers-iconic-wedding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spare</a></em>, Prince Harry revealed that he struggled with substance abuse in his younger years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the sort of revelation that&#8217;s not uncommon in celebrity autobiographies, but in Harry&#8217;s case, the confession could come with some unpleasant legal consequences.</p>
<p>Some of the drug use Harry talked about took place while he was visiting the US. And now, political enemies of the Duke of Sussex would like to see him kicked out of the country as a result.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-major-legal-setback-for-harry">A major legal setback for Harry?</h2>
<p>Last year, conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/its-meghan-markles-fault-that-prince-harry-might-get-deported-for-doing-drugs-royal-expert-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanding the release of Harry&#8217;s visa application</a>, as well as other documents related to his migration to the US.</p>
<p>Now, a judge has ruled in the foundation&#8217;s favor and ordered that Harry&#8217;s files must be released by the end of today.</p>
<p>What might that mean for Harry and his family? Well, it&#8217;s possible that there will be no consequences at all.</p>
<p>But as many have pointed out, the Trump administration prides itself on its aggressive approach to deportation, and making an example out of a high-profile political opponent like Harry might be a tempting prospect for the White House.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of discretion that the government has, but merely admitting to drug use very often is not disqualifying from entering the country, but lying about drug use can be more serious and potentially could be disqualifying,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-harry-us-immigration-files-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a> legal contributor Jessica Levinson said today.</p>
<p>And according to a new report from the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14510253/prince-harry-visa-documents-unsealed-duke-papers-row-drug-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, at least one high-profile UK politician has sided with the Heritage Foundation by &#8220;urging&#8221; to self-deport.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Harry is here illegally it would be hypocritical for him to get special treatment given the mass deportations occurring now,&#8221; says Chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, Greg Swenson</p>
<p>&#8220;Smartest thing for Harry would be to leave the US, avoid the proceedings and leave voluntarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the Trump White House might protect Harry&#8217;s right to remain in the US, Swenson replied, &#8220;It probably won&#8217;t rank high enough as an issue. I don&#8217;t think he will intervene.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="713" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1024x713.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-521557" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1024x713.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-300x209.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-768x535.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-2048x1426.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-960x668.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1080x752.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1252743584-1200x836.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrives for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andy Stenning  &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Royal journalist Richard Fitzwilliams added that if Trump intervenes at all, it probably won&#8217;t be on Harry&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Fitzwilliams told <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/royal/prince-harry-leave-us-bombshell-documents-royal-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GB News</a>: &#8220;We know what the Sussexes think politically. They are strongly anti-Trump.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harry-s-confession">Harry&#8217;s confession</h2>
<p>In his book, Harry admitted to using cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, and other illicit substances while spending time in the US as a young man.</p>
<p>“Of course I had been taking cocaine at that time. At someone’s house, during a hunting weekend, I was offered a line, and since then I had consumed some more,” Harry wrote in one version of his book (per CBS News).</p>
<p>“It wasn’t very fun, and it didn’t make me feel especially happy as seemed to happen to others, but it did make me feel different, and that was my main objective. To feel. To be different.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/courteney-cox-prince-harry-tripped-on-mushrooms-at-my-house-and-he-did-not-have-my-permission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry also admitted to taking mushrooms</a> during a party at the home of actress Courteney Cox.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that his past actions will force Harry to return to the UK, but you can bet that he and wife Meghan Markle are feeling a bit anxious today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p></p>
