<p>That&#8217;s great news for fans of the franchise who have longed for it to receive better recognition for showing the lives and struggles of these young mothers.</p>
<p>You know who <em>isn&#8217;t</em> loving this news? Farrah Abraham.&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Great news for MTV and for <em>Teen Mom</em> fans!</p>
<p>MTV&#8217;s official Twitter account tweeted out this:</p>
<p>&quot;NEWS: #TeenMom Is nominated for Best Unstructured Reality Series at the 2018 #CriticsChoice Awards! @AmberLPortwood&quot;</p>
<p>Their competition in this category includes:</p>
<p><em>Born This Way</em></p>
<p><em>Ice Road Truckers</em></p>
<p><em>Intervention</em></p>
<p><em>Live PD</em></p>
<p><em>Ride With Norman Reedus</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re willing to bet that most people haven&#8217;t even heard of every series on the list, but this is the Critics Choice &#8212; it&#8217;s about which series they believe is best-executed, not necessarily which show is most popular with all viewers.</p>
<p>But Farrah Abraham was not in a celebratory mood:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="731" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-731x1024.jpg" alt="Farrah Abraham in White" class="wp-image-276604" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-731x1024.jpg 731w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-1097x1536.jpg 1097w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-1463x2048.jpg 1463w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-735x1029.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-239x335.jpg 239w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-248x347.jpg 248w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-371x520.jpg 371w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-457x640.jpg 457w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-549x768.jpg 549w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-686x960.jpg 686w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-771x1080.jpg 771w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/farrah-abraham-in-white-scaled.jpg 1828w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Farrah replied to the tweet, writing:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think it will win as it&rsquo;s very structured, manipulated by the network.&quot;</p>
<p>So, this is the sort of stuff that Farrah &#8212; like so many disaffected reality stars &#8212; love to say about a reality show once they&#8217;ve left.</p>
<p>Farrah&#8217;s tweet continued: &quot;production &amp; almost scripted story lines at this point&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>So, nothing that we haven&#8217;t heard from her before.</p>
<p>Cattily, MTV&#8217;s Twitter account replied to Farrah:</p>
<p>&quot;Well it&#8217;s a honor being nominated it&#8217;s at pretty big award show.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Honestly, part of what must have gotten under Farrah&#8217;s skin was that MTV had directly tagged Amber Portwood in the announcement.</p>
<p><a href="/2017/12/farrah-abraham-congratulates-matt-baier-slams-amber-portwood-of/">Farrah <em>really</em> doesn&#8217;t like Amber Portwood</a>.</p>
<p>But another issue that Farrah has lately is that she, well, is being forced by a producer to choose between <a href="/2017/10/farrah-abraham-i-was-fired-from-teen-mom-og-for-being-a-sex-work/">continuing with her sex work or being a <em>Teen Mom OG</em> star</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s a little more complicated than that; we&#8217;ll get to that)</p>
<p>We all remember how <a href="/2017/11/farrah-abraham-mtv-didnt-fire-me-but-they-are-committing-hate-cr/">Farrah Abraham has rambled about &quot;hate crimes,&quot;</a> which she apparently believes are just things that people hate.</p>
<p>She accused Viacom, MTV&#8217;s parent company that also owns like, most things that aren&#8217;t owned by Disney (we&#8217;re exaggerating &#8230; barely) of shaming her.</p>
<p>She first announced that she was fired &#8230; and then clarified that she was <em>not</em> fired, merely hate-crimed and sex-shamed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><a href="/2017/12/farrah-abraham-the-real-story-behind-her-teen-mom-og-firing/">The real story behind&nbsp;Farrah&nbsp;Abraham&#8217;s &quot;firing&quot;</a>&nbsp;is that a producer who represents neither Viacom nor MTV presented&nbsp;Farrah&nbsp;with the ultimatum: quit&nbsp;camgirling&nbsp;or quit&nbsp;<em>Teen Mom</em>.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t have the authority to do that. He also appeared to stage the situation so that Farrah&#8217;s reaction could be caught on camera. Maybe he was just looking for drama.</p>
<p>However, he caused a serious rift between Farrah and MTV and Viacom, because Farrah tends to explode with anger and resentment instead of, you know, realizing that one dickish&nbsp;producer overstepped his bounds.</p>
<p>In the process, she may have alienated herself from the decision-makers who <em>do</em> matter.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what Farrah&#8217;s response to MTV&#8217;s nomination was &#8212; she&#8217;s still bitter and resentful and, as usual, spent a lot of time and energy taking it out on the wrong people while making things worse for herself.</p>
<p>It is, if nothing else, very on brand for her.</p>

Ben Affleck&#8217;s day ended much better than it started.</p>
<p>Less than 12 hours earlier, Affleck was among the notable <a href="/2013/01/oscar-nominations-what-was-the-biggest-snub/">Oscar snubs</a>, left off the list of nominees at the prestigious 85th Annual Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Nice way to salvage the day.</p>

<p>When the camera panned to the married father of three, his jaw dropped as he looked around and realized the star-studded audience was on its feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; Affleck said, collecting his Best Director award. &#8220;I would like to thank the Academy &#8230; I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding! This is the one that counts.&#8221;</p>
