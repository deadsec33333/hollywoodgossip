</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-announce-separation-destroy-our-belie/">Chris Pratt and Anna Faris announced their separation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because 2017 was a nightmare and love is dead, basically.</p>
<p>Like most splits, this one was complex. it doesn&#8217;t really sound like there was a &quot;bad guy&quot; in this lovable couple.</p>
<p><a href="/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-did-his-success-ruin-their-marriage/">Chris Pratt&#8217;s success may have been a factor in their breakup</a>. A lot of people jokingly tweeted &quot;this is why I&#8217;m never letting my man get hot&quot; after the news broke.</p>
<p>Because Chris and Anna are parents, this isn&#8217;t just about them, and they&#8217;re <a href="/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-anna-faris-trying-couples-counseling/">undergoing couple&#8217;s counseling</a> during their divorce process.</p>

<p><a href="/2017/04/aaron-rodgers-and-olivia-munn-its-over/">Olivia Munn&nbsp;and Aaron Rodgers broke up</a> this past spring.</p>
<p>Olivia Munn is an actress, while Aaron Rodgers is a sportsball player. Specifically, of the football variety.</p>
<p>Their relationship &#8212; which endured for three years &#8212; was controversial with Aaron&#8217;s fans, for perhaps the stupidest of reasons.</p>
<p>Some Green Bay Packers fans believed that Olivia Munn somehow siphoned away his strength, through &quot;distraction&quot; or, we guess, sorcery, causing him and his team to perform less adequately.</p>
<p>When <a href="/2017/08/aaron-rodgers-finally-talks-about-his-olivia-munn-breakup/">Aaron Rodgers finally opened up about their split</a>, he admitted that outside pressure &#8212; combined with the stress of dating while famous &#8212; did make their relationship harder.</p>
<p>But their break-up was amicable, at least.</p>

<p>And now, according to a report in <a href="https://okmagazine.com/"><em>OK! Magazine</em></a>, Chris Pratt and Olivia Munn are dating.</p>
<p>&quot;It started as a convenient rebound but blossomed into something very real and exciting,&quot; their source reports.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s sweet!</p>
<p>&quot;Chris and Olivia have a genuine connection.&hellip; She and Chris really like each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, they&#8217;ve been friends for a while, so that makes sense. But neither know what the future holds.</p>
<p>&quot;They both want to see where this goes.&quot;</p>

<p>According to this report, they initially leaned on one another as friends.</p>
<p>(They always got along well, even as far back as 2016)</p>
<p>However, that friendship blossomed into something else.</p>
<p>The source claims that Anna Faris is furious. But, honestly, even if that&#8217;s true, wouldn&#8217;t she presumably be furious about anyone he might choose to date?</p>
<p>Reportedly, that&#8217;s not giving Olivia Munn any pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Olivia isn&rsquo;t fazed by what Anna or anyone else thinks.&quot;</p>
<p>Good. She&#8217;s accustomed to unfair criticism.</p>

<p>Chris Pratt is 38. Olivia Munn is 37. This is super age-appropriate and mature.</p>
<p>Which makes sense. We&#8217;ve never seen Chris Pratt as the kind of guy who celebrates (or copes with) being single by banging a bunch of college-aged models.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, with Disney&#8217;s recent acquisition of tens of billions of dollars worth of FOX properties, whether Olivia Munn gets to continue to be part of the X-Men cinematic universe (following her role as Psylocke in <em>X-Men Apocalypse</em>) is up in the air.</p>
<p>While we think that it&#8217;s a coincidence &#8212; again, she and Chris have been friends for years &#8212; some critics are bound to argue that she&#8217;s somehow using Chris Pratt in the hopes that their &quot;association&quot; will convince Disney to keep her onboard.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s &#8230; absurd. People just love to hate Olivia Munn for some reason.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s fresh, it&#8217;s chock full of action. It even has a talking raccoon and a barely-talking tree, the latter of whom may very well leave you in tears.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s one thing this summer blockbuster is missing &#8211; and that&#8217;s an abundance of cats.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the creative folks at The Pet Collective are here with an answer to that problem. Feast your eyes, readers, on&nbsp;Guardicats of the Galaxkitty, a video that features&nbsp;Chris Prcat&nbsp;(get it?) as&nbsp;Cat Lord (get it?!?), as he and his friends do battle over something really shiny.</p>
<p>Check out the funny video now, but do NOT refers to the main character as <a href="/stars/grumpy-cat/">Grumpy Cat</a>. He won&#8217;t be happy.</p>

<p>In the past, of course, it&#8217;s been left to pugs to recreate famous movies, as these <a href="/2013/12/pugs-recreate-elf-totally-awwww-inspiring/">pugs recreated Elf</a> and these pugs told the <a href="/2013/12/home-alone-as-told-by-adorable-pug-puppies/">story of Home Alone</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, did you catch the Pugs of Westeros?!? You must view this photo gallery:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>With insane box office and glowing reviews, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is shaping up to be the movie of the summer.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s really no need for Chris Pratt to continue promoting the film that&#8217;s made him an A-list Star-Lord. But even so, Chris keeps dropping viral gems all over the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="/2014/08/chris-pratt-slams-orlando-bloom-shows-off-amazing-rap-skills/">Pratt showed off his rap skills</a> with an amazing Eminem impression. Today, he gives us a tour of Peter Quill&#8217;s awesomely futuristic/retro ship, the Milano.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/chris-pratt-guardians-of-the-galaxy-set-tour"></a></figure>
<p>The ship name and the old school tape deck aren&#8217;t the only things that might gave you a flashback here.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re of a certain age, the impeccable homage to <em>MTV Cribs</em> will bring you back to a time when C-list pop stars showed you &quot;where the magic happens&quot; every week.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Yes, Chris&#8217; mastery of the douchey <em>Cribs</em> narration style is almost as impressive as his <a href="/2014/08/chris-pratt-weight-loss-pics-see-the-transformation/"><em>Guardians</em> body transformation</a>.</p>
<p>GOTG is still in theaters, and we already can&#8217;t wait for a sequel &#8211; if only so that we can see Chris make the media rounds again.</p>
<p>Another <a href="/2014/08/guardians-of-the-galaxy-howard-the-duck-cameo-is-leaked-internet/">Howard the Duck cameo</a> would be nice, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Despite (or perhaps because of) the film&#8217;s bizarre premise and cast of characters, <a href="/2014/08/guardians-of-the-galaxy-reviews-an-outstanding-space-odd-yssey/"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> reviews</a> have been overwhelmingly positive, and the latest Marvel adaptation is expected to be a major box office hit.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/guardians-of-the-galaxy-trailer-number-2"></a></figure>
<p>So, naturally spoilers and leaked footage abound on the Internet today, with one surprise tidbit generating global cries of, &#8220;WTF?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the 1986 film <em>Howard the Duck</em>, consider yourself lucky. Like <a href="/2014/08/selena-gomez-behaving-badly-movie-receives-the-worst-reviews-of/">Selena Gomez&#8217; latest movie</a>, <em>Howard</em> was a notorious box office flop and is still considered to be one of the worst movies ever made.</p>
<p>But, believe it or not, Howard actually shares a few things in common with the much-bigger-budget, much-more-well-received <em>Guardians</em>:</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Not only do both films share a common release date (the Duck laid an egg 28 years ago today), they&#8217;re both based on characters from Marvel comics that both critics and audiences doubted would translate to the big screen.</p>
<p>In the case of Howard, they were right. But while the studio has since become the first name in superhero blockbusters, let no one say that Marvel can&#8217;t laugh at itself.</p>

<p>The comic book publisher&#8217;s films have become famous for their end-credit skits and teasers, and <em>Guardians</em> is no different. Howard appears on screen and utters one line (Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll keep it to ourselves.) before the film fades to black.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping they&#8217;re not hinting at a gritty reboot.</p>
<p>Oh, and before anyone gripes about including a &#8220;spoiler&#8221; in the headline, the Howard thing is literally like a 2-second joke during the end credits. We really doubt advance knowledge of it will ruin the movie for you. If you feel otherwise, seek help.</p>

Zoe Saldana&nbsp;is green. And Bradley Cooper is a talking raccoon.</p>
<p>If nothing else,&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy very much has our attention.</p>
<p>But should it have our money? Should we go see Marvel&#8217;s latest superhero movie this weekend? A number of critics around the Internet have weighed in and here&#8217;s a rundown of what they have to say&#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review"></a></figure>
<p><em>The people who made this movie must have had a swell time in the process, and it&#8217;s nice to see a summer epic that takes itself so unseriously.</em> &#8211; Joe Morgenstern</p>
<p><em>The motley crew&#8217;s repartee makes for comedy that&#8217;s surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back. </em>&#8211; Tom Russo</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p><em>If you&#8217;re old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; will be your new favorite movie. If you&#8217;re not, it will set a standard for everything you see. </em>&#8211; Joe Williams</p>
<p><em>Nothing short of an infectiously fun, funny and highly entertaining blast to behold.</em> &#8211; Jim Judy</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s more fun than a band of misfits joining forces to battle some ruthless interstellar bad guys?</em> &#8211; Leonard Maltin</p>
<p><em>This swashbuckling space age romp treats saving the universe as just a bit of fun. Very refreshing and probably just as well. </em>&#8211; Allan Hunter</p>
<p><em>Without being shackled to fanboy expectations of how iconic costumed characters should be depicted, filmmaker James Gunn (&quot;Super&quot;) runs wild with the opportunity. </em>&#8211; Jon Niccum</p>
<p><em>Entertaining in this or any galaxy. It&#8217;s certainly the most fun I&#8217;ve had in a theater this year.</em> &#8211; Gary Wolcott</p>

<p>In the following footage, we witness more gun fights than before, along with more spaceship explosions, more Peter Quill swagger&hellip; and so much more Groot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also treated to our first looks at Glenn Close as Prime Rael, commander of the Nova forces; and at Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser.</p>
<p>Guardians of the Galaxy comes out on August 1. Marvel at the latest preview for this upcoming superhero flick now and ask yourself: Could Chris Pratt be any more awesome?!?</p>

<p>The first trailer for&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy debuted&nbsp;on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night, as fans of this Marvel classic now have their first look at a light-hearted take on a series of comic book characters led by Chris Pratt.</p>
<p>Set to&nbsp;Blue Swede&#8217;s &quot;Hooked on a Feeling,&quot; the footage features Pratt trying to look tough as&nbsp;Star-Lord, along with Bradley Cooper voicing&nbsp;Rocket Raccoon and&nbsp;John C. Reilly evaluating&nbsp;an unusual group of potential heroes.</p>
<p>Guardians of the Galaxy will be released on August 1 and it looks hilariously awesome.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to Latino Review, it appears as if that speculation might be over and it isn&#8217;t Henry&#8217;s name attached to the space dwelling raccoon, rather it is none other than <a href="http://latino-review.com/2013/08/exclusive-we-found-out-who-marvel-wants-for-rocket-raccoon-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy/">Bradley Cooper</a>!</p>

<p>The site, that is often the source of movie rumors, is saying that Cooper is at the top of Marvel&#8217;s list for the voice of Rocket Raccoon.</p>

<p>The cast of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is already chock full of interesting names, including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and the recently announced <a href="/2013/08/vin-diesel-as-guardians-of-the-galaxys-groot/">Vin Diesel as Groot</a>.</p>
<p>Will Bradley Cooper be joining this list? Hopefully Marvel and Gunn will announce soon to put a stop to this endless speculation!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/scandal/"><em>Scandal</em></a> star tweeted out earlier, &#8220;OK UK hold on, I&#8217;m comin&#8217;. Joining @James Gunn again &#8211; #Slither #Super &#8211; this time for @Marvel #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy. Gonnabegreat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside of his very savvy twitter usage, the tweet doesn&#8217;t give much information beyond that of Henry&#8217;s involvement in the upcoming film. Most of the main characters have already been cast, outside of Rocket Raccoon.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>Could Gregg Henry be Rocket Raccoon? We&#8217;ll just have to wait and find out.</p>
