<p>This is a message the group would like to send, in light of a former member claiming the contrary.</p>

<p>A few days ago, a singer named <a href="/2017/10/ex-pussycat-dolls-member-calls-out-group-as-a-prostitution-ring/">Kaya Jones made scathing accusations</a> on Twitter, alleging that she and her fellow artists were basically forced to sleep with record executives back when she was a part of the Dolls.</p>
<p>&quot;How bad was it? People ask &#8211; bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my bandmates &amp; a 13 million dollar record deal,&quot; Jones Tweeted.</p>
<p>She went on to say that <a href="/2014/09/simone-battle-dies-of-apparent-suicide-former-x-factor-contestan/">Simone Battle</a>, a member of spinoff group G.R.L., killed herself in 2014 due to her experiences in the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I want the den mother from hell to confess why another 1 of her girl group girls committed suicide? Tell the public how you mentally broke us.&quot;</p>
<p>The person to whom Jones is referring here is Robin Antin, the founder of The Pussycat Dolls.</p>
<p>She responded to Jones&#8217; allegations by labeling them as &quot;<a href="/2017/10/pussycat-dolls-founder-responds-to-that-whole-prostitution-thing/">disgusting lies</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>She also said Jones was never an official group member; she was only ever on a trial basis.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Now, The Pussycat Dolls as a whole have spoken out.</p>
<p>The all-girls group has released a lengthy statement in which it strongly denies all Jones has said about what it&#8217;s like to be a member.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pussycat Dolls has always and will always stand for female empowerment and sisterhood,&quot; the group says, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;We stand in solidarity with all women who have bravely spoken publicly of their horrific experiences of abuse, harassment and exploitation.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we cannot stand behind false allegations towards other group members partaking in activities that simply did not take place.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pussycat Dolls were founded by Antin in 1995.</p>
<p>You may remember the band for such tracks as &quot;Don&#8217;t Cha&quot;, &quot;Buttons&quot; and &quot;Stickwitu.&quot;</p>
<p>They spawned a few spinoff groups and even a Las Vegas revue.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Reads more of their statement:</p>
<p><em>To liken our professional roles in The Pussycat Dolls to a prostitution ring not only undermines everything we worked hard to achieve for all those years but also takes the spotlight off the millions of victims who are speaking up and being heard loud and clear around the world.</em></p>
<p><em>While we were not aware of Kaya&#8217;s experiences that allegedly took place during her short time working with us, before the group signed a recording contract, we can firmly testify that we were not privy to any misconduct taking place around us. </em></p>
<p><em>If Kaya experienced something we are unaware of then we fully encourage her to get the help she needs and are here to support her.</em></p>
<p>Finally, in conclusion,&nbsp;The Nicole Scherzinger-led group says the following:</p>
<p><em>Since its inception, The Pussycat Dolls and founder Robin Antin have supported and empowered women from all walks of life to flourish in their careers. </em></p>
<p><em>Should any member or associate allude to any form of abuse or harassment whatsoever, it will be taken very seriously and investigated. </em></p>
<p><em>We truly wish Kaya the best and hope she gets the help she deserves.</em></p>

<p>Late last week, <a href="/2017/10/ex-pussycat-dolls-member-calls-out-group-as-a-prostitution-ring/">Jones went off on a Twitter rant</a> that railed against her time as a member of The Pussycat Dolls.</p>
<p>The artist used harsh language to describe an allegedly horrible situation, comparing the group to a &quot;prostitution ring&quot; and saying she was forced to &quot;sleep with whoever they say.&quot;</p>
<p>She said members of the band were &quot;abused,&quot; sometimes &quot;hooked on drugs&quot; and she compared her experience as a Pussycat Doll to &quot;war.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning her attention to&nbsp;<a href="/2014/09/simone-battle-dies-of-apparent-suicide-former-x-factor-contestan/">Simone Battle</a>, a singer in spin-off group G.R.L. who committed suicide three years ago, Jones wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;I want the den mother from hell to confess why another 1 of her girl group girls committed suicide? Tell the public how you mentally broke us.&quot;</p>
<p>Without stating her name, this was clearly a reference to&nbsp;Robin Antin, the choreographer who started The Pussycat Dolls.</p>
<p>And now Antin has fired back.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>On Monday morning, Antin talked to The Blast and called the allegations, &quot;disgusting, ridiculous lies.&quot;</p>
<p>She addedthat that Jones, who was in the group from 2003-2005, is &quot;clearly looking for her 15 minutes [of fame].&quot;</p>
<p>As for why her name may not sound familiar to music fans? Antin said Jones was only ever a &quot;trial&quot; member. She was never an official Pussycat Doll.</p>
<p>This could also explain the response of&nbsp;Asia Nitollano.</p>
<p>That artist, who sang with The Pussycat Dolls in 2007, scoffed at Kaya&#8217;s remarks over the weekend as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Kaya Jones? Lol She was not apart of The Pussycat Dolls the recording group so I do not know her&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;But judging from google she looks like she just wants her 15min of fame. (Side note&#8230; it says she&#8217;s a Trump supporter&#8230; but yet she&#8217;s Canadian, which means her vote doesn&#8217;t count!!!!</p>
<p>&quot;Same with this comment about The Pussycat Dolls; she wasn&#8217;t in the group so her opinion doesn&#8217;t count!!!!&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>What about&nbsp;Battle&lsquo;s suicide?</p>
<p>Antin&nbsp;told The Blast that bringing up this topic was &quot;unfathomable and disrespectful to everyone who works towards suicide prevention and awareness,&quot; writes the website.</p>
<p>And Antin says adds that mentioning a suicide in such a brazen way not only affects the family, but the millions of people that loved and cared for Simone.</p>
<p>She has a pretty strong point there, doesn&#8217;t she?</p>
<p>If Jones is going to claim Battle killed herself due to her experience in her singing group and all that included&#8230; well&#8230; she better have some pretty hard evidence to back up such an assertion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Kaya Jones made some waves on Twitter late last week.</p>
<p>Who is Kaya Jones, you may be wondering?</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a former member of the all-girls singing group The Pussycat Dolls&#8230; although she&#8217;s here to to take issue with saying this group really had anything to do with &#8220;singing&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Or at least with the concept of making any kind of meaningful art.</p>
<p>&#8220;My truth. I wasn&#8217;t in a girl group. I was in a prostitution ring,&#8221; Jones Tweeted, adding:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh &amp; we happened to sing &amp; be famous. While everyone who owned us made the $.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, Jones is NOT saying she and her fellow artists charged money to have sexual intercourse with anyone and that her managers acted as actual pimps.</p>
<p>Not in the traditional sense of the term <em>prostitution</em>, that is.</p>
<p>Not exactly, at least.</p>
<p>But no one cared about her well-being and she was only asked to sing material others put in front of her, while executives raked in the cash she helped earn.</p>
<p>&#8220;How bad was it? People ask &#8211; bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my bandmates &amp; a 13 million dollar record deal,&#8221; Jones Tweeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we were going to be #1.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The Pussycat Dolls were founded by choreographer Robin Antin in 1995.</p>
<p>Among their many rotating members over the years, the most famous is likely Nicole Scherzinger.</p>
<p>You may remember the group for such hits as &#8220;Don&#8217;t Cha&#8221;, &#8220;Buttons&#8221; and &#8220;Stickwitu.&#8221;</p>
<p>They broke up in 2009, but Billboard ranked the Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s, as they spawned merchandise opportunities, spin-off girl groups and reality programs.</p>
<p>Without mentioning Antin by name, Jones called out the &#8220;den mother&#8221; of the group during her social media diatribe, writing:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the den mother from hell to confess why another 1 of her girl group girls committed suicide? Tell the public how you mentally broke us.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is almost certainly a reference to G.R.L. singer <a href="/stars/simone-battle/">Simone Battle</a>, who killed herself in September of 2014.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Simone Battle took her own life in 2014. May she rest in peace.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;To be a part of the team you must be a team player,&#8221; continued Jones of what she and other members were told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning sleep with whoever they say. If you don&#8217;t they have nothing on you to leverage…Yes I said leverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning after they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs they use it against you. Correct. Victimizing the victim again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The singer went on to compare herself to a member the armed forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I have so much respect for our military. I&#8217;ve been through [war]. But my scars you can&#8217;t see. At least real war is honest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we report it? Because we were all abused! I personally have been warned if I tell I will…you know end up dead or no more career.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear why Jones has spoken out about these alleged issues now, but it&#8217;s safe to assume she is responding to the controversy surrounding <a href="/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-accused-of-raping-asia-argento-forcing-himself/">Harvey Weinstein and all the women he harassed</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nicole Scherzinger has not commented on this damning accusations.</em></p>
<p>However, Asia Nitollano, an ex-member of the Pussycat Dolls, who was briefly in the group in 2007, jumped on Twitter and strongly denied everything Jones claimed in her rant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Kaya Jones? Lol She was not apart of The Pussycat Dolls the recording group so I do not know her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she was in the Vegas show then I know nothing about that nor have I ever heard such a thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;But judging from google she looks like she just wants her 15min of fame. (Side note&#8230; it says she&#8217;s a Trump supporter&#8230; but yet she&#8217;s Canadian, which means her vote doesn&#8217;t count!!!! )</p>
<p>&#8220;Same with this comment about The Pussycat Dolls; she wasn&#8217;t in the group so her opinion doesn&#8217;t count!!!!&#8221;&#8221;</p>

As executive producer, she will help scour a group of contestants for future dolls.</p>
<p><em>American Idol</em> producer Nigel Lythgoe is also on board for the program, which will select and groom the new crop of PCD members. Sounds AMAZING.</p>
<p>The newbies are &#8220;10 times better than the original group,&#8221; <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://whtc.com/news/articles/2011/sep/16/nigel-lythgoe-lining-up-kim-kardashian-more-for-re/" target="_blank">one source says</a>. Not that this is a bold statement, really. No offense, Nicole Scherzinger.</p>

            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Kim Kardashian will be evaluating talent despite possessing none</em>.</p>
<p>Insiders say she has a good relationship with PCD founder Robin Antin, and her ass had a good time performing with the group in Vegas a few years ago.</p>
<p><a href="/stars/kim-kardashian.html">Kim Kardashian</a> is telling friends she&#8217;s &#8220;super excited&#8221; to work with Nigel, who also runs <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em>, as &#8220;he&#8217;s the best in the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>That he is. Or was, before his decision to bring Kim on board.</p>

<p>But while that title is still on the line, this much is for certain: the group that made Scherzinger famous has undergone a major face-lift.</p>
<p>Four-fifths of The Pussycat Dolls have officially been replaced. Melody Thornton, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, and Kimberly Wyatt are out; and the following singers/dancers are in:</p>

<p>Led by creator Robin Antin, the new Dolls will enter the recording studio as soon as Scherzinger completes her run on <em>DWTS</em>. They&#8217;ll be forced to come up with new ways to essentially say the same thing in all their songs: <em>f-ck me. F-ck me hard!</em></p>

<p>But the all-girl group (who really hate it when you loosen up their buttons and then just front) has finally broken up, as Kimberly Wyatt told Great Britain&#8217;s <em>The Daily Mirror</em>.</p>
<p>“The girls and I have just finished our huge world tour and are taking a break from the band and doing our own thing. We’re all concentrating on our own projects and deciding what the future will hold.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Wyatt, that future will likely include more <a href="/2009/07/kimberly-wyatt-nicole-scherzinger-sucks/">bashing of Nicole Scherzinger</a>. We can&#8217;t wait!</p>

Will you front?</p>
<p>While Nicole Scherzinger and Melody Thornton are each members of the Pussycat Dolls, they haven&#8217;t always gotten along so well.</p>
<p>Just last week, Thornton said it was a &#8220;<a href="/2009/06/the-pussycat-dolls-hating-on-nicole-scherzinger/">huge misconception</a>&#8221; that her and the other singers were content to just sit around as Scherzinger worked on a solo album. Meow, indeed!</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s settle this catfight once and for all. Every song the Dolls release is based around sex, so there&#8217;s only one question that will dictate which artist is truly the group&#8217;s star:</p>
<p>With which would you prefer to have sexual intercourse?</p>

<p>When asked by Great Britain&#8217;s <em>The Sun</em> about her fellow Pussycat Doll&#8217;s professional aspirations, singer Melody Thornton didn&#8217;t hold back:</p>
<p>“Nicole’s always had extra things going on as opposed to the rest of us, but we have aspirations as well,&#8221; <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/usa/2468750/Further-feud-rumours-for-Pussycat-Dolls.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she said</a>. &#8220;It’s definitely a huge misconception that we are just chilling and happy to just be members of the group.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to choose a side in thie burgeoning cat fight, readers: Team Nicole or Team Melody?</p>

<p>Or at least filming a cameo for the new Pussycat Dolls video.</p>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a small part,&#8221; says a source about the pop star&#8217;s visit to the L.A. set of the group&#8217;s video shoot for their new single, &#8220;When I Grow Up.&#8221;</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>Possibly saving her trademark moves for her own album (or because she&#8217;s lost them for good) Spears is not expected to dance or perform in the video.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip of the video being filmed this week:</p>
<p>[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFNK6iXkxvs[/youtube]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em></em><em>The Pussycat Dolls create yet another groundbreaking music video.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As for the recovering Britney Spears, she&#8217;s possibly dating producer <a href="/2008/05/britney-spears-dating-jason-trawick/">Jason Trawick</a> but definitely treading lightly as she tries to regain a career.</p>
<p>While her recent TV meetings have been strictly exploratory, <em>How I Met Your Mother </em>star Neil Patrick Harris said the cast of that show would be happy to have her back for a third time saying, &#8220;The door is open for her.&#8221;</p><p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2008/06/britney-spears-to-make-cameo-in-pussycat-dolls-video/">Britney Spears to Make Cameo in Pussycat Dolls Video</a> was originally published on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com">The Hollywood Gossip</a>.</p>
