<p>Brian Austin Green has taken his feud with Machine Gun Kelly public.</p>



<p>And we could <em>not</em> be more here for it.</p>



<p>As you might recall, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/megan-fox-pregnant-2/">Megan Fox announced in November</a> that she&#8217;s pregnant with her fourth child &#8212; the first three with ex-husband Green and this latest one with Kelly.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks after we learned about this blessed piece of news, however, we also learned that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/megan-fox-and-machine-gun-kelly-its-over-again/">Kelly had broken up with Fox</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522290" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1167814973-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Austin Green at BuzzFeed&#8217;s &#8220;AM to DM&#8221; on August 13, 2019 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t know why exactly.</p>



<p>But Green spoke to TMZ shortly after this break-up took place and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/brian-austin-green-rips-machine-gun-kelly-for-dumping-pregnant-megan-fox/">told Kelly to &#8220;grow up&#8221; because</a> Fox is expecting his child.</p>



<p>Now, meanwhile, Green has re-shared a screenshot of his direct message with Machine Gun Kelly on his Instagram Stories after the musician messaged him to scream at the actor for repeatedly asking when his baby with Fox is due.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop asking when our child is gonna be born. you the FEDS.&#8221; Kelly recently wrote to Green, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;Quit calling TMZ and focus on that apology you owe me for speaking my name in public.&#8221;</p>



<p>It would seem as if Green is taunting Kelly by asking about the aforementioned due date.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-660x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522291" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-660x1024.jpg 660w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-193x300.jpg 193w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-619x960.jpg 619w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154-696x1080.jpg 696w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/Brian-Austin-Green-instagram-032725-f9d4a3a7aa844f67b2544365aeb10154.jpg 758w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption><span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;You chose the wrong one to f-ck with mr child actor. go back to cereal commercials,&#8221; Kelly added.</p>



<p>This prompted a pretty funny response from Green.</p>



<p>Underneath the photo on his Instagram Stories, Green wrote, &#8220;😂😂😂😂 I didn&#8217;t know &#8216;child actor&#8217; was something bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leo, careful,&#8221; Green continued, seemingly referencing Leonardo DiCaprio, who rose to fame way back in the day on the sitcom Growing Pains. &#8220;He may be coming for you next.&#8221;</p>



<p>Back on February 3, Green wrote in a since-expired Instagram Stories post: </p>



<p>&#8220;Bro. Just be honest for once in your life. Stop caring so much about how you’re perceived that you will try and drag other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Green shares three kids &#8212; Noah Shannon, 12, Bodhi Ransom, 10 and Journey River, 8 &#8212; with Fox.</p>



<p>Despite their divorce, the two clearly remain on good terms.</p>



<p>“I just want the best for her, I want the best for the baby, I want the best for our kids,” added Green a few weeks ago, continuing as follows when it comes to Kelly and Fox no longer being together in the wake of creating a human being:</p>



<p>“That’s a shame. That’s a shame. I’m heartbroken about it because I know she’s been so excited and the kids are so excited for life and the change and all of that.” </p>

<p>Green, for his part, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/sharna-burgess-and-brian-austin-green-welcome-first-child/">welcomed a baby with girlfriend Sharna Burgess</a> in the summer of 2022.</p>



<p>“[Fox] gets along really well with Sharna. Megan trusts her around the boys,” an insider told People Magazine this past December.</p>



<p>“Brian’s a great dad, too. Megan feels fortunate that her boys are loved and always taken care of.”</p>

<p>Brian Austin Green is standing up for his ex-wife.</p>



<p>As you may have heard this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/megan-fox-and-machine-gun-kelly-its-over-again/">Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox have split</a> up&#8230; just one month after we learned that the actress was pregnant with the couple&#8217;s child.</p>



<p>Seriously, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/megan-fox-pregnant-2/">Fox just announced</a> this blessed news a few weeks ago.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="747" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1024x747.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515192" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1024x747.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-300x219.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-768x561.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-2048x1495.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-960x701.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1080x788.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-457097598-1200x876.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green attend Ferrari Celebrates 60 Years In America on October 11, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for Ferrari North America)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>We don&#8217;t know many details behind the shocking break-up, but observers have been under the assumption that Machine Gun Kelly is the one who wanted out of the relationship.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Green thinks, at least.</p>



<p>The actor spoke on December 12 to a TMZ cameraman and expressed both surprise and anger over his former spouse no longer being with Kelly, placing the blame for this situation directly on the shoulders of the eccentric musician.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had no idea,&#8221; Green first said when asked about Fox and Kelly ending their romance.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-515193" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-456702632-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green attend the Underground Event Screening of Paramount Pictures&#8217; &#8216;TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES&#8217; at UFO Sound Studios on October 5, 2014 in Berlin, Germany.  <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures International)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After the TMZ reporter alleged that Kelly was unfaithful to his former fiancée, Green replied: </p>



<p>&#8220;How old is he? Do you know? He&#8217;s in his 30s. Nice… In your 30s, like &#8212; I don&#8217;t know. Grow up. She&#8217;s pregnant.&#8221;</p>



<p>To be clear, there&#8217;s been no confirmation that Kelly cheated on Fox.</p>



<p>But Green shares three kids with the brunette beauty (Noah Shannon, 12, Bodhi Ransom, 10 and Journey River, 8) and the two have remained close in the wake of their own divorce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want the best for her, I want the best for the baby, I want the best for our kids,&#8221; added Green in this same interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a shame. That&#8217;s a shame. I&#8217;m heartbroken about it because I know she&#8217;s been so excited and the kids are so excited for life and the change and all of that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Green and Fox have quite the history: </p>



<p>They met in 2004 while filming the sitcom Hope &amp; Faith and then got married in 2010. </p>



<p>The stars went their separate ways at one point during the 2010s, and then got back together, and then ended things for good when Fox filed for divorce from Green in November 2020&#8230; mere days after she and Kelly stepped out as a couple for the first time. </p>



<p>Fox and Kelly got engaged in 2022.</p>

<p>This past March, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/megan-fox-confirms-end-of-machine-gun-kelly-engagement/">Kelly and Fox called off</a> their eventual wedding. But they stayed together.</p>



<p>Green, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/sharna-burgess-and-brian-austin-green-welcome-first-child/">welcomed a baby with girlfriend Sharna Burgess</a> in the summer of 2022.</p>



<p>“[Fox] gets along really well with Sharna. Megan trusts her around the boys,” an insider told People Magazine on Friday, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Brian&#8217;s a great dad, too. Megan feels fortunate that her boys are loved and always taken care of.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Poor <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/tori-spelling-had-a-miserable-2023-a-complete-timeline/">Tori Spelling has had a miserable 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Health problems, the mold infestation behind them, searching for a new home, Dean announcing their split, and her hospitalization &#8230; it&#8217;s been so much. <em>Too </em>much.</p>



<p>Despite everything, Tori isn&#8217;t letting the chaos and humiliation destroy her.</p>



<p></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tori Spelling shared this outdoor selfie in April of 2023. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Brian Austin Green has known Tori for a long time. Obviously. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar, they&#8217;re both <em>Beverly Hills 90210</em> alums.</p>



<p>And he spoke <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1385535/brian-austin-green-shares-how-tough-tori-spelling-is-doing-amid-difficult-chapter">to <em>E! News</em></a><em> </em>about how she&#8217;s handling the endless barrage of BS and misery that life has thrown her way.</p>



<p>&#8220;I talked to her today,&#8221; he shared. &#8220;She&#8217;s doing great.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Austin Green returned as a heightened version of himself. He will play David Silver during the filming of the reboot within a reboot. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (FOX)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Assessing her character and fortitude, he then noted: &#8220;Tori is tough.&#8221;</p>



<p>He elaborated: &#8220;She&#8217;s going through stuff that is difficult for her right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>That is a bit of an understatement, truth be told.</p>

Gorgeous!<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;ll absolutely get through it,&#8221; Brian Austin Green affirmed.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; he predicted, &#8220;it&#8217;ll make her a stronger person.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh really? If the rest of 2023 ends up being like her spring and summer have been, she&#8217;ll be able to juggle bowling balls by January.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On social media, Tori Spelling models a stylish and comfortable-looking garment. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering why anyone is asking for BAG&#8217;s thoughts on Tori, well, they&#8217;re reuniting this weekend.</p>



<p>90s Con 2023 began Friday, September 15 in Tampa, Florida. Yes, 90s Con. Feel old yet?</p>



<p>A number of Beverly Hills, 90210 actors united there, including Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, and Jason Priestley. Plus Brian and Tori.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Once again at Urgent Care with her family, Tori Spelling shared photos to warn followers about the hidden dangers of mold. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This spring, Tori Spelling shared that she had found the culprit behind the months and months of medical mysteries and even hospitalizations that her family had faced.</p>



<p>The family home &#8212; a rental &#8212; had a mold infestation that rendered it unsafe for human habitation. Unsafe for many other animals, also.</p>



<p>Chronic exposure to the mold spores had taken a toll on their health.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In this lengthy caption from May 2023, Tori Spelling shared her family&#8217;s story of repeated illnesses. The culprit? Dangerous mold in their home.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>So, even after they left the home, they did not immediately escape the long-term effects of mold exposure.</p>



<p>As many of Tori&#8217;s followers quickly warned her, these symptoms could persist for months or even years.</p>



<p>With that in mind, Tori signaled her plans to undergo brain scans (along with the rest of her family). Chronic mold exposure can lead to chronic inflammation of the brain. Which is, for the record, bad for you.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taking to her Instagram Story, Tori Spelling revealed that she and her family members need to undergo brain scans after living with an extremely hazardous mold infestation.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And then, of course, came the house-hunting. Tori and Dean may be famous, but they&#8217;re not exactly loaded. Especially not with five (amazing) kids to feed and clothe.</p>



<p>Then Dean announced the end of their marriage. He deleted the post, but not the sentiment.</p>



<p>We hope that Brian Austin Green is right. Maybe Tori will only grow stronger from her miserable girl summer.</p>

<p>Blessed and exciting news to share today out of Hollywood:</p>



<p>Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess are first-time parents!</p>



<p>The long-time actor and his professional dancer girlfriend welcomed their first baby together three days ago, according to Green on Instagram, as the star wrote the following last night, along with two heart emojis:</p>



<p>&#8220;Zane Walker Green born 6/28 at 12:12.&#8221;</p>

<p>Green included with this caption a black and white photo of the newborn wrapped in a blanket &#8230; holding on to his index finger.</p>



<p>Burgess shared the same snapshot and caption on her Instagram page, although the new mom added to the caption by stating:</p>



<p> &#8220;My heart is now forever outside of my body.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>For Green, this is his FIFTH child overall.</p>



<p>He has a now-20-year old son with ex Vanessa Marcil; and three more sons with ex Megan Fox: Noah, 9, Bodhi, 8, and Journey, 5.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the former Beverly Hills, 90210 cast member told People Magazine that his children are &#8220;super excited&#8221; to bring a new addition into the family.</p>



<p>&#8220;They check on Sharna every day and they rub her belly and talk to the baby. They&#8217;re counting down the days!&#8221; Green told this outlet, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;[The baby] is definitely coming into a super warm household and family and he&#8217;ll be surrounded by a lot of love. It&#8217;s exciting.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Green and Burgess made their romance Instagram official way back in January 2021 after the the Dancing with the Stars pro uploaded a photo of the pair kissing on a hotel balcony..</p>



<p>The 36-year old captioned the post, <em>HIM</em>.</p>



<p>In February of this year, she then announced she was pregnant.</p>



<p>&#8220;And suddenly my world would never be the same,” the Australia native wrote via Instagram at the time. </p>



<p>&#8220;Forever greater, forever expanded and deeper. Forever abundant and unconditional. </p>



<p>&#8220;Baby Boy July 4th (ish) 2022. @brianaustingreen I love our family, I love that it’s growing and I love you. How did we get so lucky.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Burgess was actually on birth control when she conceived, revealing in a March Instagram Story that the baby news was NOT something she saw coming.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were thinking of trying mid to late this year lol. But the Universe made her own plan, found a window and went for it,&#8221; she said at the time. </p>



<p>&#8220;Why not now? We are big believers in everything happening for a reason. </p>



<p>&#8220;There was definitely Divine timing with this one and we are excited about it, trusting in it.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Congratulations to Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Earlier this week, <a href="/2020/11/megan-fox-calls-out-brian-austin-green-for-halloween-photo-how-d/">Megan Fox called out Brian Austin Green for exposing their kid</a> in an Instagram photo.</p>
<p>Now, Megan has posted pics of her kids on the &#8216;Gram several times before, but she <em>really </em>went off on BAG for what seemed to most fans nothing more nefarious than a fun Halloween pic.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>&quot;Why does Journey have to be in this picture? It&#8217;s not hard to crop them out. Or choose photos that they aren&#8217;t in,&quot; an irate Megan commented on Brian&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a great halloween with them yesterday, and yet notice how absent they are from my social media,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>From there, Megan switched to a slightly more conciliatory tone, seemingly in an effort to convey to Green that she really, really does not want her ex posting pics of her children.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I know you love your kids. But I don&#8217;t know why you can&#8217;t stop using them to posture via Instagram,&quot;&nbsp; Fox wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;re so intoxicated with feeding the pervasive narrative that I&#8217;m an absent mother, and you are the perennial, eternally dedicated dad of the year,&quot; she continued.</p>
<p>&quot;You have them half of the time. Congratulations you truly are a remarkable human! Why do you need the internet to echo back to you what should be inexhaustibly evident in the way your children love you?&quot;</p>

<p>At first, the celebrity community seemed split on this issue, as both parties have a whole host of famous friends.</p>
<p>But today, Courtney Stodden weighed in, and she&#8217;s got insider info that could tip the scales.</p>
<p>Now, you might be asking yourself &#8212; what the hell does Courtney Stodden have to do with this mess?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Well, not a whole lot, but<a href="/2020/06/brian-austin-green-dating-courtney-stodden-after-megan-fox-split/"> Green banged Stodden</a> a while back, and it seems he didn&#8217;t make a good impression on her.</p>
<p>More accurately, he pissed her off after the fact and undermined her celebrity status by revealing that&nbsp;<a href="/2020/08/brian-austin-green-shades-megan-fox-i-care-about-our-kids/">he didn&#8217;t know who she was until they slept together</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;During my time spent with him, when I was over at his house, his kids were never there. They were always with Megan. She wasn&rsquo;t an absent mother. And yet, like she says &#8211; she doesn&rsquo;t plaster them all over her social,&quot; Stodden wrote on Instagram on Tuesday.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;There were times Brian would tell me that he couldn&rsquo;t see me because he had his kids &#8211; and I later found out that this wasn&rsquo;t true, he was actually just seeing other women at those times,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;Like, dude &#8211; you&rsquo;re allowed to see other people, just be honest about it. To me and to them. And don&rsquo;t use your kids as your lie.&quot;</p>
<p>Courtney claimed that Green was dating &quot;many women at once&quot; while they were together, all while &quot;acting like this doting single dad.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;How could all of us women who he&rsquo;d tried to play be mad at such a loving father?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole experience was a bit gross. Women and children are not props. How long until men realize this?&quot;</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>At first, the public seemed to be mostly on Brian&#8217;s side, and the consensus seemed to be that Megan had overreacted.</p>
<p>But if Courtney is right, and Brian really was using his kids to help him juggle multiple relationships at the same time &#8230; well, that&#8217;s undeniably scummy.</p>
<p>The ball is in your court, BAG! Time to clear your name!</p>

<p>But they will be parents forever.</p>
<p>And it was in this capacity, as a mother to a young child, that Fox called out Green over the weekend. In very public fashion.</p>

</p>
<p>On Sunday, the actress left a lengthy comment on the actor&#8217;s Instagram page, taking serious issue with how Green revealed the face of the former couple&#8217;s son, Journey, to the world.</p>
<p>Green and Fox, <a href="/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-it-really-is-over/">who broke up for good in May</a>, share three children together and have famously kept them out of the spotlight ever since birth.</p>
<p>Hence, Fox&#8217;s anger here.</p>
<p>The former Beverly Hills, 90210 star posted an Instagram photo of himself and son Journey in honor of Halloween this past Saturday, prompting a livid response from Fox.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&#8220;Why does Journey have to be in this picture?&#8221; Fox wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not hard to crop them out. Or choose photos that they aren&#8217;t in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a great halloween with them yesterday, and yet notice how absent they are from my social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you love your kids. But I don&#8217;t know why you can&#8217;t stop using them to posture via Instagram.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pretty reasonable reply, huh?</p>
<p>We have to assume that Fox and Green agreed years ago to never publicize their kids in anyway and that agreement shouldn&#8217;t end just because their romance did.</p>
<p>Fox did go ahead and make things personal, though.</p>
<p>She was clearly pissed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so intoxicated with feeding the pervasive narrative that I&#8217;m an absent mother, and you are the perennial, eternally dedicated dad of the year,&#8221; continued the actress.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have them half of the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations you truly are a remarkable human!</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you need the internet to echo back to you what should be inexhaustibly evident in the way your children love you?&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Green did not response publicly to Fox&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>To his credit, however, after Fox posted her remark, Green took her advice:</p>
<p>He deleted the post and shared the same photo with their son cropped out.</p>
<p>See for yourself:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Green revealed in May that he and Fox broke up in late 2019, more than nine years after they wed.</p>
<p>They appeared to reconcile at various points since then, only to call things off once and for all this spring.</p>
<p>Fox has since entered into a significant relationship with Machine Gun Kelly, with Green recently alleging that he <a href="/2020/08/brian-austin-green-shades-megan-fox-i-care-about-our-kids/">caught his ex-wife in bed with the rapper</a>.</p>
<p>Yikes, huh?</p>

<p>In August, Fox posted on Instagram a photo of her with her new boyfriend&#8230; with towels wrapped around their waists, writing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Achingly Beautiful Boy&#8230; My heart is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Green appeared to counter her post with one of his own, perhaps throwing a bit of shade via a slideshow of photos of their sons, as well as a pic of his 18-year-old son Kassius Marcil-Green, writing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Achingly beautiful boys&#8230;&#8230; My heart is yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CEfKvyXHl_F/?utm_source=ig_embed">Instagram Live</a> over the weekend, Brian Austin Green spoke about his former marriage to Megan Fox.</p>
<p>When it comes to the idea of rekindling their relationship, he admits: “I never say never.&#8221;</p>
<p>“You never know,&#8221; Brian says. &#8220;I kinda feel like people are on paths in life.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="792" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-792x1024.jpg" alt="Megan Fox and BAG Photo" class="wp-image-273512" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-792x1024.jpg 792w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-232x300.jpg 232w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-768x993.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-1188x1536.jpg 1188w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-1584x2048.jpg 1584w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-735x950.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-259x335.jpg 259w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-268x347.jpg 268w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-402x520.jpg 402w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-495x640.jpg 495w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-594x768.jpg 594w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-743x960.jpg 743w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-835x1080.jpg 835w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/megan-fox-and-bag-photo-scaled.jpg 1980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>He waxes philosophical, saying: &#8220;and sometimes your paths are together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Brian narrates, &#8220;you travel that path together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continues: &#8220;and you see eye to eye.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; Brian says, &#8220;sometimes those paths do different things.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Megan, he gushes that the two of them had “amazing 15-year relationship” and continue to love their “three beautiful kids,”</p>
<p>However, he acknowledges that their lives have now moved in separate directions.</p>

<p>“We shared a lot together,&#8221; Brian affirms during his Instagram Live.</p>
<p>He continues, acknowledging: &#8220;and we really went through a lot together.&#8221;</p>
<p>“So right now the paths are different,&#8221; Austin characterizes the current state of things.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Austin says that their personal journeys have diverged &#8220;and she is on her path.&#8221;</p>
<p>He states taht Megan is simply &#8220;doing what she feels she needs to be doing to be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I’m on my path,&#8221; Brian adds, &#8220;doing what I feel I need to do to be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it’s not for a lack of love for the kids,&#8221; Brian strongly emphasizes.</p>
<p>He iterates &#8220;or lack of being responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian correctly states that &#8220;it’s really important to take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s important for us as parents to take care of ourselves,&#8221; Brian points out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish her all the best,&#8221; he expresses regarding his ex.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he adds a little oddly, &#8220;I wish myself the best as well.” He does note that perhaps his and Megan&#8217;s paths might once again &#8220;run parallel&#8221; to each other.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>You hear Brian Austin Green say that he&#8217;s open to rekindling things with Megan, and you naturally think two things.</p>
<p>One, of course he is. Everyone on the planet is &#8220;open&#8221; to being with Megan Fox.</p>
<p>Two, that&#8217;s kind of sad and has some vague Divorced Dad Energy, if not anything approaching that of Ben Affleck.</p>

<p>But in reality, he&#8217;s just expressing a realistic view of how many possibilities the future may hold, and wouldn&#8217;t want to rule it out now and end up eating crow.</p>
<p>Additionally, he doesn&#8217;t want to come across as bitter that his hot, younger wife moved on &#8212; with Machine Gun Kelly, of all people.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not saying that he&#8217;s secretly bitter. He and Megan share similar worldviews in a lot of ways, and part of that includes an attitude of acceptance, if you know what we mean.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s really no question that he and Megan are always going to put their kids first.</p>
<p>Self-care, yes. But never at the expense of their children&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>Megan once moved to a new house because she was convinced that her unborn child didn&#8217;t like the current one. So yes, they&#8217;ll put the kids first, even in goofy ways.</p>

<p>Brian Austin Green doesn&#8217;t seem to love that, and he is using their children to shade his ex and her new man.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old Green and 34-year-old Fox <a href="/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-it-really-is-over/">ended their ten year marriage</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Married in June of 2010, they split late this spring, just weeks before their 10 year anniversary.</p>
<p>Megan has already moved on to a younger man &#8211; the 30-year-old Machine Gun Kelly.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In a recent Instagram post, Megan and MGK showed off their hot bodies in a sexy mirror selfie.</p>
<p>Megan showed her famously gorgeous torso, making sure that she wore just enough to be &#8220;Instagram appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to cultural double standards, MGK wore even less, though he is absolutely covered with tattoos.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>If you can tear your eyes away from their unclothed torsos and past the implications of them both wearing towels, take a look at the caption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Achingly beautiful boy, my heart is yours,&#8221; Megan captured this double-trouble thirst trap.</p>
<p>Notably, she has deactivated comments on it. Considering how much hate she has received from trolls over the last 12 years, we do not blame her.</p>

<p>Brian freely admitted that he was disappointed late last year when Megan, filming abroad, felt &#8220;freer and more like herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the two had resolved to keep things amicable despite their split.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps especially upon seeing her go official with her &#8220;friend&#8221; Machine Gun Kelly, he is getting a bit shadier.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Alongside a series of photos of his sons, Brian copied Meghan&#8217;s caption, making one word plural.</p>
<p>&#8220;Achingly beautiful boys, my heart is yours,&#8221; he quipped.</p>
<p>Unlike Megan, he did not deactivate comments, with many commenters telling him that they saw exactly what he did there.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Typically, we strongly recommend against any adult describing any minor as &#8220;achingly beautiful,&#8221; regardless of whether it&#8217;s a joke.</p>
<p>We hope that we do not have to explain why. But in this case the point Brian was making was obvious.</p>
<p>Many have also questioned how tasteful it is to use your own children to shade your ex-wife. Because &#8230; yikes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Still, having your ex flaunt her new man for the world to see in such fashion can&#8217;t be an easy pill to swallow, especially under these circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found out in my own way,&#8221; Brian said in a recent podcast interview about his ex going from friends to sexytimes with MGK.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that’s as much detail as I’ll give you on that one,&#8221; he stated, setting a boundary.</p>
<p>Brian added: &#8220;I didn’t read about it or anything like that.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;You can if you ignore it and avoid it which is what I try and do,&#8221; Brian said of the now public dalliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to no read anything or look at anything and not involve myself in it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Brian said that he tries to &#8220;Just keep my head down and do what I do and focus on the kids. I know she’s going to do the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>On that same podcast, Brian complained about feeling &#8220;betrayed&#8221; by Courtney Stodden and Tina Louise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s unfortunate for me in this situation is I&#8217;ll literally go on one date with someone,&#8221; he complains.</p>
<p>BAG continues: &#8220;Not even a date, just out to lunch with somebody and it&#8217;s written, &#8216;his new fling, he&#8217;s playing two women at the same time.'&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;No. I literally spent one time with each of these women. I&#8217;m not playing anybody,&#8221; Brian insists.</p>
<p>He gripes: &#8220;My life is just much more under a microscope than somebody else&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea that Instagram was so much of a dating site until I was single,&#8221; Brian reflects, arguably showing his age a little.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;Because up until then, I posted pictures of benches, trees, the ocean, and my kids doing stuff here and there,&#8221; Brian explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a total married dad on it,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Then all of a sudden I started getting DMs when Megan and I separated.&#8221;</p>
<p>BAG remarks: &#8220;Instantly, no shame in their game at all.&#8221;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&#8220;I remember when I hung out with Courtney getting a call from somebody afterward saying, &#8216;There are pictures of you and Courtney Stodden,'&#8221; BAG recalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I was like &#8216;How do you know her name?&#8217; I had no idea who she was or any of the past anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had done no research at all,&#8221; he confesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until I was told, &#8216;This is the past, this is who this person is, this is what you might have to experience.'&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;Then you have that moment of, &#8216;Oh s&#8211;t, what have I done? S&#8211;t.&#8217; Hindsight again, 20/20. I wish I would have known beforehand,&#8221; Brian says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Courtney was a really nice person though, I don&#8217;t want to bad mouth her,&#8221; he emphasizes, and we strongly agree.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have done some of the things she&#8217;s done, been the person she&#8217;s been, is the person she is,&#8221; BAG shades, &#8220;but when I spent time with her, super kind, super polite.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Megan and Brian initially seemed devoted to keeping things civil and maintaining an amicble co-parenting relationship for the sake of their kids.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s more than a little disappointing to see that their split has turned this ugly.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping they&#8217;re able to turn things around and bury the hatchet sooner rather than later.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The last thing 2020 needs is a Brian Austin Green vs. Machine Gun Kelly rap battle.</p>
<p>Seriously, haven&#8217;t we been through enough already?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping we didn&#8217;t just speak that monstrosity into existence!</p>

<p>It looks like Brian may be moving on from his marriage with none other than Courtney Stodden.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>On Saturday, June 13, Brian Austin Green was spotted out and about with the beautiful Courtney Stodden.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old actor and the 25-year-old singer and media personality were seen together in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Restaurants have for some reason reopened in California despite the pandemic, and the two stopped by to grab some Mexican food.</p>
<p>That sounds delicious &#8230; but was it also a date?</p>

<p>To be clear, they didn&#8217;t pack on any PDA.</p>
<p>For all that we know, this could have just been a friendly outing between a man and woman who are both moving on from long-term marriages.</p>
<p>That said, observers could not help but note that they looked like a very cute (potential) new couple.</p>
<p>And though Courtney had a mask with her as a common sense safety precaution, she was also spotted smiling.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Brian married Megan Fox in 2010, at a time when she was one of the most discussed and thirsted-after celebrities on the planet.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s still a gorgeous actress, but these days, must of her time is spent devoted to her children.</p>
<p>Now, it has been more than three weeks since the pair announced their split.</p>
<p>Megan has been widely rumored to have moved on by dating Machine Gun Kelly.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1004" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-1024x1004.jpg" alt="Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox in 2014" class="wp-image-346276" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-1024x1004.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-300x294.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-768x753.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-1536x1506.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-2048x2008.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-735x721.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-335x329.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-347x340.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-520x510.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-640x628.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-960x941.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/brian-austin-green-and-megan-fox-in-2014-1080x1059.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Courtney Stodden was catapulted to fame when she became a child bride.</p>
<p>At 16, Courtney married actor Doug Hutchison, who at the time was 50 years old.</p>
<p>Their 2011 marriage, permitted by Courtney&#8217;s parents, caused a significant stir as propelled Courtney into the limelight.</p>
<p>Their marriage had its ups and downs. In 2018, Courtney filed for divorce, and that divorce was finalized in January 2020.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Since this outing between her ex and Courtney, Megan has confirmed her relationship with Machine Gun Kelly.</p>
<p>Courtney and Brian, however, have yet to put a label on what may have been a simple lunch.</p>
<p>Some on social media have speculated that it may have been a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you want to generate media buzz, there are much worse ways to do it than go grab a bite to eat in pleasant company.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, though, Courtney and Brian might make a lot of sense for each other &#8212; if they choose to pursue a relationship.</p>
<p>Brian is not too unlike Courtney&#8217;s ex, in that he is an older actor.</p>
<p>Courtney, like Megan, has a sensitive soul and has been outrageously portrayed for years.</p>
<p>Are these superficial similarities? Absolutely. But they are what we have to go on.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Some nay-sayers may argue that this relationship is nothing but a rebound &#8212; possibly for both of them.</p>
<p>Courtney has spent two-fifths of her life married, though part of that marriage was just on paper.</p>
<p>Similarly, Brian has spent a decade in his marriage, and he and Megan were already head over heels before they exchanged vows.</p>
<p>Is diving into this relationship now going to doom them to fail &#8212; if that is indeed what they are doing?</p>

<p>Well, not necessarily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that some rebound romances turn out to be successful for years (just look at Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, right?).</p>
<p>But not all romances have to last a decade and end in marriage (and then in either death or divorce).</p>
<p>People are allowed to have a good time and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. After a breakup, that can be very healing.</p>

<p>Very witty puns and segues aside, the aforementioned actor has now come out and confirmed an ongoing rumor:</p>
<p>He and his lovely wife are going their separate ways.</p>
<p>Green confirmed the demise of his decade-long marriage on Monday&#8217;s episode of his podcast, during which the star addressed photos of the Transformers actress out with Machine Gun Kelly that surfaced last week.</p>
<p>Green explained he started to feel distant from Fox since in late 2019 when she left the country to film Midnight in the Switchgrass with the rapper.</p>

<p>After Fox returned home, &quot;things hadn&rsquo;t really changed,&quot; Green said, elaborating as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;She said, &#8216;I realized when I was out of the country working alone that I feel more like myself and I liked myself better during that experience and I think that might be something worth trying for me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;I was shocked and I was upset about it, but I can&rsquo;t be upset at her because she didn&rsquo;t ask to feel that way. It wasn&rsquo;t a choice she made, that&rsquo;s the way she honestly felt.</p>
<p>&quot;We talked about it a little more and said let&rsquo;s separate for a bit&hellip; and so we did.&quot;</p>

<p>Green and Fox also separated in the summer of 2015&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; but the separation clearly didn&#8217;t take because they announced Fox was pregnant the following April and the couple then welcomed their <a href="/2016/08/megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-welcome-third-child/">third child in August 2016</a>.</p>
<p>Green said on his podcast that he and Fox still plan to &quot;do vacations and holidays as a family,&quot; adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will always love her. And I know she will always love me and I know as far as a family what we have built is really cool and really special.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>E! News, meanwhile, confirms that Fox and Machine Gun Kelly&nbsp; are &quot;hooking up.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear when this romance started, but Green didn&#8217;t sound especially bitter on his podcast. He didn&#8217;t accuse his wife of infidelity.</p>
<p>But he did get choked up at one point and said of Fox:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sucks when life changes and something that you&rsquo;re used to, that you&rsquo;ve been doing for 15 years, you try and not get rid of but you change. There&rsquo;s the unknown aspect &hellip; there&rsquo;s that pit in my stomach &hellip;</p>
<p>&quot;I really don&rsquo;t want Megan and I to be at odds &hellip; she&rsquo;s been my best friend for 15 years and I don&rsquo;t want to lose that.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Pretty sweet sentiment there, huh?</p>
<p>The stars share sons Journey River, 3, Bodhi Ransom, 6, and Noah Shannon, 7.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been incredibly protective of their kids&#8217; privacy over the years, too.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;Machine Gun Kelly? Green talked openly about Fox&#8217;s new loverr.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve never met him, but Megan and I talked about him and they&#8217;re friends at this point,&quot; Green said on air.</p>
<p>&quot;And from what she&#8217;s expressed, he&#8217;s a really just nice, genuine guy. I trust her judgment. She&#8217;s always had really good judgment.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t want people to think that [they] are villains or I was a victim in any way with any of this &#8212; because I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn&#8217;t something new for us. This is something new for people to experience and hear about in the press &#8230; but it&#8217;s not new for us.&quot;</p>

<p>For the record, no divorce papers have been filed yet.</p>
<p>And Green even said the following toward the end of his podcast:</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows if this is the end of the journey.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, we have a lot of life left. So the paths have started gone in separate ways for now. They could come back together. They may not. We don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
