										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> &lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span><p>Shailene Woodley covers the new issue of Vanity Fair, and as expected, the earth mother actress gave the mag a ramblingly naive interview in which she tackles the Big Issues: fracking, global warming, GMOs&#8230;and how weird <em>Divergent</em> fans can be.</p>
<p>And not just <em>Divergent</em>, fans, mind you, but any screamingly obsessed young folks. Take it away, Shai:</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole fan thing is very strange to me,&#8221; says Woodley. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had anybody that I have gone crazy for&#8230;And so it&#8217;s a weird thing for me to relate to, especially the screaming sort of young fandom the <em>Twilight</em>, <em>Hunger Games, Divergent </em>world caters to.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/2014/06/shailene-woodley-scoffs-at-jennifer-lawrence-comparison-we-both/?PageSpeed=noscript">Woodley has scoffed at Jennifer Lawrence comparisons</a> in the past, so this isn&#8217;t the first time she&#8217;s mentioned <em>Divergent</em> and <em>HG</em> in the same breath.</p>
<p>Her comments are certainly understandable, but in addition to the fact that they may alienate her youthful fan base, is Shailene subtly (and perhaps unintentionally) throwing shade on the J-Laws and K-Stews of the world?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>After all, by talking about how weird overzealous fans are, doesn&#8217;t she imply that stars who don&#8217;t openly reject that culture are also a bit strange? </p>
<p><a href="/2014/03/shailene-woodley-throws-shade-at-the-twilight-saga-what-a-terrib/">Woodley dissed <em>Twilight</em></a> in the past and some might interpret her remarks to Vanity Fair as a continuation of the inter-franschise beef.</p>
<p>Or perhaps we&#8217;re reading too much into Shailene&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>After all, the actress has a history of endearingly unguarded, off the cuff comments that have angered oversensitive fans.</p>
<p>Many accused <a href="/2014/05/shailene-woodley-is-not-a-feminist-fails-to-grasp-concept-of-fem/">Woodley of making anti-feminist comments </a>earlier this year after she stated that she doesn&#8217;t identify with the movement. </p>

<p>Lionsgate announced today that the Divergent trilogy’s concluding book, Allegiant, will be split into two films, with Allegiant &#8211; Part 1 coming out on March 18, 2016; and Allegiant &#8211; Part 2 on March 24, 2017.</p>

<p>&#8220;Veronica Roth brings her captivating story to a masterful conclusion in Allegiant, a rich, action-packed book with material that is ideally suited to two strong and fulfilling movies,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Co-Chairmen Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger in a statement, adding:</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The storytelling arc and world of the characters lend themselves perfectly to two films, a storytelling strategy that has worked very well for us on the two Twilight Breaking Dawn films and about which we’re tremendously enthusiastic for the two upcoming Mockingjay films of The Hunger Games franchise.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Divergent has raked in $117 million at the domestic box office in its opening three weeks of release.</p>
<p>The second film of the saga, Insurgent, will hit theaters March 20, 2015.</p>

<p>And then circle <strong>March 20, 2015</strong> on your calendar.</p>
<p>Hours after the film opened with an impressive $4.9 million on Thursday night, Lionsgate announced that it&#8217;s officially moving forward with the second movie, <em>Insurgent</em>.</p>
<p>As if there was ever any doubt, right?</p>

<p>“We’re off to a great start with strong numbers from all regions of the country, urban, suburban and rural alike,” said Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said. “We’re confident that <em>Divergent</em> is on its way to becoming another important franchise for us, and we have just greenlit the second film, <em>Insurgent</em>.”</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>

<p>Assuming the sequel also performs well, a third franchise installment (<em>Allegiant</em>) is slated for March 2016.</p>
<p><em>Divergent</em>, which stars <a href="/stars/shailene-woodley/">Shailene Woodley</a> and Theo James, expected to earn at least $60 million over its first weekend of release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Divergent, the eagerly awaited first film based on Veronica Roth&#8217;s best-selling novel is finally in theaters.</p>
<p>Shailene&nbsp;Woodley&nbsp;and Theo James shine as&nbsp;Tris&nbsp;and Four, bringing their relationship off the page and onto the screen.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/divergent-final-trailer"></a></figure>
<p>Divergent is set in a dystopian, post-Apocalyptic Chicago. Society is divided into five factions, each representing individual personality traits and serving a purpose within the society: the selfless Abnegation, the smart Erudite, the honest Candor, the peaceful Amity, and the brave Dauntless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 16, each child must take a test to determine into which faction he or she belongs. Beatrice Pryor discovers that she is &quot;divergent.&quot; The test can&#8217;t place her into one faction because she possesses traits of several.</p>
<p>On Choosing Day, she leaves her life in Abnegation for one in Dauntless. There she meets Four and finds herself while learning that Jeanine Matthews, leader of Erudite, has a plan to eliminate her old faction, including her parents.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Shailene Woodley and Theo James bring #FourTris to life and their on-screen chemistry elicited many squeals of delight from members of the audience at the Atlanta Divergent premiere earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their banter off-screen makes their onscreen chemistry that much hotter.</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s one of the issues taken with the film.</p>
<p>The novel featured a slow burn for the #FourTris relationship that speeds up rather quickly in the film. That&#8217;s as much because of the limited time in which a film can develop a relationship as it is in order to pander to the teen audience who love that Tris and Four are in love. Or falling in love. Or are just hot on the screen together.</p>
<p>Or maybe they just want to see Theo James shirtless and covered in Dauntless tattoos as many times as possible and hey, I can&#8217;t blame them for that.</p>
<p>In fact, if we&#8217;re being honest, many of us would probably watch a movie of <i>just</i> that.</p>

<p>Fresh-faced <a href="/stars/shailene-woodley/">Shailene Woodley</a>, who is continually compared to Jennifer Lawrence for their similar roles in similar films, brought some wonderful doe-eyed amazement to Tris.</p>
<p>One of Tris&#8217; characteristics is that she&#8217;s not good at lying. That makes her a poor fit for Abnegation and often adds some humorous moments to the film. She&#8217;s a little sarcastic and okay with speaking her mind and standing up for what she believes in.</p>
<p>Shailene Woodley portrayed those aspects of Tris well and made the character&#8217;s wonder at the world around her feel believable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there parts of this film which are different from the book? Absolutely. Some of the subplots involving Tris and the other transfers were cut or lessened to make room for the #FourTris relationship and the fight against Abnegation. Characters who felt more important in the novel became nearly nonexistent in the film.</p>
<p>That has to happen though. Films cannot, in 2.5 or even 3 hours, adequately convey onscreen all which writers can share on a page. Don&#8217;t let the differences between the film and the book dissuade you from hitting the theaters this weekend.</p>
<p>You will want to see&nbsp;<em>Divergent</em>&nbsp;in theaters if for no other reason than to see what all the fuss was about. And to hold you over until&nbsp;<a href="/categories/the-hunger-games/"><em>The Hunger Games</em></a> returns in November.</p>

Let&#8217;s celebrate the release of the post-apocalyptic teen drama by rounding up some of the craziest things Shailene Woodley has said during her many recent interviews.</p>
<p>From <a href="/2014/03/shailene-woodley-i-suntan-my-vagina/">sun-tanning her vagina</a> to eating clay, Shailene has a lot of, uh, INTERESTING habits.</p>
<p>I suspect if we DID all live in a destroyed future-Chicago Shailene would either survive way longer than any of us (foraging for food! making her own cheese!) or she&#8217;d be the first one killed (sharing her aloha soul with the wrong people sounds dangerous).</p>
<p>Maybe we should have seen this coming &#8211; after all, she is <a href="/categories/divergent/"><em>Divergent</em></a>.</p>
<p>Read 13 of her craziest quotes below and see what we mean:</p>

<p>The final trailer for the much-anticipated film has been released.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stars Shailene Woodley and Theo James hit up Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday to unveil the clip we&#8217;ve all been waiting for, and it sure doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;disappoint.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/divergent-final-trailer"></a></figure>
<p><em>Divergent</em>, based on the hit young adult novel by Veronica Roth, takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where citizens are placed into five distinct factions of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At age 16, citizens must take an aptitude test to determine which faction they fit into.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shailene plays Beatrice Prior, whose aptitude test results reveal she fits into three factions, not one. Yup. She&#8217;s <em>divergent</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch the <a href="/2013/11/divergent-trailer-poster-released-the-only-way-to-survive/">Divergent trailer</a> above to see her&nbsp;kick some ass, throw some knives, and be generally awesome.&nbsp;<em>Divergent</em> hits theaters March 21, 2014.</p>
<p>What do you think of the new footage? Tell us below!</p>

The first official trailer for the film adaptation of Veronica Roth&#8217;s best-selling young adult novel is here!</p>
<p>Starring Shailene Woodley and Theo James, <em>Divergent</em> is set in a dystopian futuristic Chicago, where the citizens are divided into distinct factions.</p>
<p>Woodley&#8217;s Beatrice &#8220;Tris&#8221; Prior is about to take the crucial aptitude / personality test that all 16-year-olds must to find out where they belong.</p>
<p>Watch the full-length preview for the much-anticipated movie below:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/divergent-movie-trailer"></a></figure>
<p>As you might expect, even if you&#8217;re among the uninitiated, Tris&#8217; results make her &#8230; divergent. In other words, she just doesn&#8217;t fit into any society.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way society can survive is for each of you to claim your rightful place,&#8221; Kate Winslet, who plays a faction leader, tells the divided groups.</p>
<p>Tris, therefore, must hide who she is as she seeks to learn what makes herself and others deemed divergent so dangerous, before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>She meets and flirts with her instructor, Four (James), trains to establish her rank among her competitors, and tries to conceal her identity at all costs.</p>
<p>It looks pretty awesome. As does the official poster for the movie, released by Summit and featuring Woodley and James against a futuristic backdrop &#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you different makes you dangerous&#8221; is the official <em>Divergent</em> tagline.</p>
<p>There are several book references in the poster. Can you find them, readers?</p>
<p>Catch it in theaters March 21, 2014 &#8230; and in the meantime, comment below:</p>
<p><em>What do you think of the Divergent trailer? Will it be as good as advertised?</em></p>

<p>Still confused over what the heck was going on with <a href="/2013/08/miley-cyrus-at-the-vmas-feeling-horny/">Miley Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards</a> tonight? We don&#8217;t blame you.</p>
<p>But take a couple moments below to focus less on <a href="/categories/twerking/">Twerking</a> and more on freaking&#8230; out, that is, over the next teen-based blockbuster.</p>
<p>The first trailer for <em>Divergent</em> premiered at the VMAs, with fans of the best-selling novel getting their first look at Shailene Woodley in action as Tris. We also see Kate Winslet as the villainous Jeanine Matthews, along with Theo James coming to Tris&#8217; rescue as Four.</p>
<p>The film, which opens March 21, imagines a future world in which citizens are divided into factions based on their abilities. But what happens when one young lady is different? When she is Divergent from the rest?</p>
<p>WATCH NOW:</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve read Veronica Roth&#8217;s book, then you know that this photo is likely from the earliest parts in the film. Perhaps the choosing ceremony? Not sure when else there would be so much Abnegation gray in one place.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t have too much longer to wait for the latest young adult dystopian novel adaptation as <em>Divergent</em> opens in theaters on March 21st of next year. </p>
