<p>Benson Boone made quite the impression at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/grammys-2025-the-complete-list-of-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Grammy Awards</a> on Sunday.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t merely mean that he had a piano on stage, did a dramatic flip, and was sporting a revealing little number while introducing himself to most viewers for the first time.</p>



<p>Amidst the sea of social media posts either thirsting after him or panning his performance (and sometimes both) was a lot of commentary about his faux pas.</p>



<p>On stage, Benson Boone adjusted himself through his pants. It was <em>not </em>a subtle gesture. Whoops!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grammy-awards-viewers-got-an-eyeful-of-benson-boone">Grammy Awards viewers got an eyeful of Benson Boone</h2>



<p>On Sunday, February 2, Benson Boone introduced himself to millions as he performed &#8220;Beautiful Things&#8221; on stage.</p>



<p>He put on quite the show, and we don&#8217;t just mean the 1970s-inspired jumpsuit with the plunging neckline.</p>



<p>Boone demonstrated his acrobatics, flipping through the air. And he still managed to perform the song.</p>



<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2/app.bsky.feed.post/3lhaibf7hvs2x" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicw5s3l2hu6xmtiqvtozj6rtdjgbmzza2jhwvc6iiyt4rif7ko4h4"><p lang="en">here&#x27;s Benson Boone grabbing his penis on stage at the Grammys for all of you whores<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2/post/3lhaibf7hvs2x?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Spencer Althouse (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2?ref_src=embed">@spenceralthouse.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2/post/3lhaibf7hvs2x?ref_src=embed">February 2, 2025 at 9:22 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>However, as you can see from this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spenceralthouse.bsky.social/post/3lhaibf7hvs2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> post and so many others, Benson Boone had a bit of a &#8230; well, not a wardrobe malfunction. More like a wardrobe <em>adjustment</em>.</p>



<p>Wearing clothing is a major source of discomfort, and sometimes we need to adjust our clothing or bodies in order to feel slightly less miserable. In Boone&#8217;s case, he needed to adjust his genitals.</p>



<p>While this is far from obscene, the slight course-correction is generally considered rude to do. And you <em>really </em>don&#8217;t want to do it on stage where millions can and will see you do it.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-683x1024.jpg" alt="Benson Boone and his plunging neckline at the Grammys on February 2, 2025." class="wp-image-518396" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_bensonboone_02-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Benson Boone performs onstage during the 67th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-has-apologized-for-his-little-whoopsie">He has apologized for his little whoopsie</h2>



<p>Benson Boone took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bensonboone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story in the wake of the Grammy Awards to apologize &#8212; and to attempt to explain.</p>



<p>“Sorry for adjusting my jumpsuit so aggressively on stage tonight,” he wrote atop a shirtless selfie in the wee hours of Monday morning.</p>



<p>Boone then explained, writing: “that thing was extremely restricting in certain areas.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Benson Boone jokingly apologizes for adjusting his crotch onstage at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GRAMMYs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GRAMMYs</a>:<br><br>“that thing was extremely restricting in certain areas” <a href="https://t.co/q9nRcLRYNM">pic.twitter.com/q9nRcLRYNM</a></p>&mdash; Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1886382848883519757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 



<p>Many of Boone&#8217;s new fans were pretty eager to forgive him.</p>



<p>Simply put, if you&#8217;re thirsty enough for someone, a little on-stage mistake (it is, again, bad manners) is easy to overlook. Especially if you&#8217;re viewing them through <em>horny goggles</em>, and the genital adjustment does nothing to deter your interest.</p>



<p>Again, for many, this was their first introduction to the young singer. However, we&#8217;re sure that, in time, people will have new impressions of him beyond &#8220;the flipping guy who adjusted himself on stage.&#8221; Probably.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-benson-boone">Who is Benson Boone?</h2>



<p>Aside from his acrobatics and the knowledge that he&#8217;s a good-looking guy, no matter how much he self-sabotages with a bad hairstyle, many people don&#8217;t know much about him. Boone was a new face (and chest and upper abdomen) to many Grammys viewers.</p>



<p>Boone is 22 years old. He is an <em>American Idol</em> alum (sort of) who gained popularity among TikTok users, catching the attention of Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds.</p>



<p>Benson Boone is Mormon. And he&#8217;s reportedly in a relationship with fellow TikTok influencer Maggie Thurmon. Those facts have cropped up on social media as mitigating factors when it comes to some of Sunday night&#8217;s thirsty tweets. But they&#8217;re clearly not dealbreakers for everyone.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift did not take home a single Grammy on Sunday night.</p>



<p>Even so, she managed to set a record.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-divorce-rapper-to-split-from-bianca-censori-any-second-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Grammy Awards show</a> meant <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/grammys-2025-the-complete-list-of-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a night full of winners</a>, despite the somber undertone to the event.</p>



<p>In lieu of an award, Taylor received a dubious honor &#8212; making an exclusive list for what some might call &#8220;snubs.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift on February 2, 2025 on stage at the Grammy Awards." class="wp-image-518339" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift speaks onstage during the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-after-six-grammy-nominations-taylor-swift-took-home-zero">After six Grammy nominations, Taylor Swift took home zero</h2>



<p>On Sunday, February 2, Taylor Swift did not win a single Grammy Award at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.</p>



<p>That makes her one of only ten artists in the history of the Grammys to receive six or more nominations without scoring a single win.</p>



<p>Some are calling this a snub &#8212; though most &#8220;snubs&#8221; mean zero nominations, not zero wins. Others are calling this another <em>just-plain-impressive</em> milestone under Taylor&#8217;s belt.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift poses at the Grammys red carpet on February 2, 2025." class="wp-image-518340" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s a &#8220;snub&#8221; or not, Taylor Swift received five Grammy Award nominations for <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, her 11th studio album. </p>



<p>That album <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-album-shatters-record-proves-she-is-really-pretty-popular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smashed sales records</a> in spring 2024, though it did receive a mix of critical reviews. (&#8220;Who&#8217;s Afraid of Little Old Me&#8221; is a phenomenal track, however)</p>



<p>Taylor also received a single Best Pop Duo nomination for &#8220;Us,&#8221; a Gracie Abrams collaborative single from <em>The Secret of Us</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-make-no-mistake-taylor-swift-holds-a-singular-distinction-in-grammy-awards-history">Make no mistake, Taylor Swift holds a singular distinction in Grammy Awards history</h2>



<p>To date, Taylor Swift is the only music artist in history who has won Album of the Year <em>four </em>times.</p>



<p>Album of the Year is essentially the highest honor at the Grammys. </p>



<p>In contrast, some of the (other) biggest names in music have never won that award. Beyonce herself just won Album of the Year for <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-1-country-song-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Carter</a></em> for the very first time &#8212; notably, the first Black winner of the award in <em>decades</em>. (The last was Lauryn Hill &#8212; in 1999)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift walks the Grammys red carpet on February 2, 2025." class="wp-image-518342" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0203_taylorswift_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift attends the 67th GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Taylor was not alone in having many nominations and zero wins.</p>



<p>Both the incomparable Billie Eilish and also Post Malone received numerous nominations. Billie received seven for <em>Hit Me Hard and Soft</em>, and a nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for &#8220;Guess,&#8221; a Charli XCX song. (Definitely the best duo of the year, no matter what the Grammy Awards think)</p>



<p>Post Malone received eight nominations. Three of which were from <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, as he worked with Taylor on &#8220;Fortnight.&#8221; Neither he nor Billie received any Grammy Awards on Sunday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-singers-have-seen-numerous-nominations-and-zero-wins">Other singers have seen numerous nominations and zero wins</h2>



<p>Kendrick Lamar, Sir Paul McCartney, and even the magnificent Rihanna have all received a long list of nominations without any wins.</p>



<p>It happens to the best singers &#8212; genuinely. The nominations alone show how respected someone&#8217;s music is within the industry. Which is why we can&#8217;t really call nominations without wins a &#8220;snub.&#8221;</p>



<p>Overall, we&#8217;d do better to focus upon the positive from the Grammy Awards. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/who-is-chappell-roan-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chappell Roan</a> took home an award for Best New Artist. While she&#8217;s not new to music, 2024 was her breakout year for millions of new fans. The award was well-deserved.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/grammys-2025-the-complete-list-of-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Grammy Awards</a> took place in Los Angeles last night, and as usual, the red carpet was loaded with daring looks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-divorce-rapper-to-split-from-bianca-censori-any-second-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca Censori&#8217;s nearly nude dress</a> might be dominating the discourse today, but she&#8217;s not the only celeb who tested the limits.</p>



<p>Chrissy Teigen also rocked a transparent frock. And while it wasn&#8217;t quite as revealing as Bianca&#8217;s, she still managed to turn quite a few heads.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chrissy-and-john-s-big-night">Chrissy and John&#8217;s Big Night</h2>



<p>Chrissy&#8217;s husband John Legend was nominated for three Grammys, including Best Children’s Music Album for his latest effort, My Favorite Dream.</p>



<p>Along with the couple&#8217;s kids Luna and Miles, Chrissy provided background vocals for the album’s song “L-O-V-E.” </p>



<p>Of course, John was forced to play second fiddle to Chrissy on the red carpet, as she sported the second-most-talked-about dress of the night.</p>

<p>While some media outlets might be claiming that <a href="https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/chrissy-teigen-bianca-censori-grammys-949083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrissy was trying to &#8220;one-up&#8221; Bianca</a>, we doubt that she knew (or cared) that another star would be rocking a transparent look.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, fans were happy to see Chrissy and John smiling after the month they&#8217;ve had.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forced-to-evacuate">Forced to Evacuate</h2>



<p>The Legends were among the many stars who were forced to evacuate their home amid the LA wildfires.</p>



<p>With their kids and pets in tow, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-very-scared-as-they-evacuate-with-4-kids-pets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrissy and John moved into a hotel room</a> as the inferno blazed, with Chrissy documenting the experience on social media.</p>

<p>“I haven’t had the words, it is a hellscape. … Thank you for reaching out. Looking for any and all ways to help our community right now,” Chrissy wrote on her Instagram Story, alongside a video showing a wall of smoke and flames.</p>



<p>In a video in which she was seen frantically packing her children’s belongings, Chrissy described the entire experience as “very surreal.”</p>



<p>Many of the stars who were in attendance at last night&#8217;s awards were directly impacted by the fire.</p>



<p>And while there&#8217;s still a long way to go in the rebuilding process, at least the music industry was able to take a night off and, in the process, express their gratitude to the Los Angeles firefighters who saved so many lives.</p>

<p>But while performances from Chappell Roan, Shaboozey, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, and Teddy Swims had the audience dancing in the aisles, music&#8217;s biggest night was, as always, about the winners.</p>



<p>So without further ado, here&#8217;s your complete list of all the artists who took home the night&#8217;s biggest hardware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 7</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Beyonce is nominated for multiple Grammys in 2025, but historically, she&#8217;s been shut out from the top awards on multiple occasions. </p>



<p>Her newest album <em>Cowboy Carter </em>is nominated for Album of the Year, but that is one Grammy she has never won. While fans are rooting for her, it&#8217;s more than likely that she&#8217;ll miss out again.</p>



<p>Understand, this is not a criticism. However, in the past, Beyonce has been favored to win Album of the Year at the Grammys multiple times, but she&#8217;s always come up short when the final award gets handed out. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="695" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1024x695.jpg" alt="Beyonce on October 25, 2024 while campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris." class="wp-image-512650" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-300x204.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-960x652.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1080x733.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1105_beyonce_01-1200x814.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BeyoncÃ© looks on during a campaign rally with Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, at Shell Energy Stadium on October 25, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In our humble opinion, <em>Cowboy Carter </em>is certainly deserving of the prize, but there&#8217;s definitely no saying whether she&#8217;ll get the award. And as we&#8217;ve learned time and time again this year, history has a way of repeating itself.</p>



<p>Besides, even though Bey is nominated in a bunch of categories (including Album of the Year), she does have some stiff competition, going up against rising popstars like Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, and Charli XCX.  Past Album of the Year winners Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish are also nominated this year, and honestly, it&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-grammys-does-beyonce-have">How Many Grammys Does Beyonce Have?</h2>



<p>Queen B is the artist to win the most Grammy Awards ever, which should come as no surprise. She&#8217;s also the most nominated artist of all time. She shares that honor with her husband, Jay-Z.</p>



<p>Beyonce has won 32 Grammys throughout her career. As of 2025, she has been nominated 88 times, which is definitely no small feat!</p>

<p>The &#8220;Crazy In Love&#8221; singer received her first solo nominations in 2004. She has been nominated as a member of Destiny&#8217;s Child and for her collab album with Jay-Z as The Carters.</p>



<p>Beyonce has been nominated in the general field many times, but she has only won Song of the Year once. Her only win came in 2010 for the megahit &#8220;Single Ladies.&#8221;</p>



<p>Next year, Beyonce has the opportunity to expand her lead as the most-honored Grammy winner in history. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/beyonce-first-black-woman-number-1-country-song-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Her album <em>Cowboy Carter</em></a> has a whopping 11 nominations for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, making her the most nominated artist this year.</p>



<p>Despite winning many Grammys, Beyonce has been shut out for many of the Recording Academy&#8217;s General Field awards. And that&#8217;s not the only time she&#8217;s felt that burn. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-s-cma-shutout">Beyonce&#8217;s CMA Shutout</h2>



<p>One of the most glaring snubs for Bey actually came in September 2024. When the Country Music Awards announced their nominees, <em>Cowboy Carter </em>was noticeably absent.</p>



<p>Even though Beyonce has never been nominated for a CMA before, many people were surprised to see arguably the most famous singer in the world shutout, because <em>Cowboy Carter </em>is a country album.</p>



<p>The CMAs have not explained exactly why they snubbed <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, but <em>Vox </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/370704/beyonce-cowboy-carter-cma-country-music-awards-snub-what-happened-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that perhaps a lack of promotion or the fact that the award show favors male pop crossovers may have been why. </p>

<p>Despite the clear country influences, Beyonce may have hurt her standing in the country world when she announced the album. &#8220;This ain’t a Country album. This is a &#8216;Beyoncé&#8217; album,&#8221; she wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beyonce/p/C4s6Zr7rlwA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>Even though the CMAs didn&#8217;t explain <em>Cowboy Carter&#8217;s </em>omission, a few country stars have offered their opinions on why Beyonce didn&#8217;t get a nomination. Some of them suggested that Beyonce isn&#8217;t in the country world enough to get the recognition.</p>



<p>Luke Bryan noted that the &#8220;Halo&#8221; singer hasn&#8217;t been part of the country &#8220;family,&#8221; which may have been why she got left out. He explained his thought during an <a href="https://youtu.be/pspALWzUpQI?si=56lb7WH_MfmH1sh7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> on <em>Andy Cohen Live</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you’re gonna make country albums, come into our world and be country with us a little bit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come to an award show and high-five us and have fun and get in the family, too. And I’m not saying she didn’t do that … but country music is a lot about family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dolly Parton, who is featured on the album, also shared her thoughts on the controversy in a <em>Variety </em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/dolly-parton-beyonce-taylor-swift-1236147283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>. &#8220;There’s so many wonderful country artists that, I guess probably the country music field, they probably thought, well, we can’t really leave out some of the ones that spend their whole life doing that,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The lack of CMA nominations clearly didn&#8217;t affect <em>Cowboy Carter&#8217;s </em>run for the Grammys, because she was nominated in multiple country music categories, including Best Country Album.</p>



<p>That being said, it&#8217;s still not clear if Beyonce will win in any of the country categories, because she&#8217;s up against a few artists who are more firmly in the country world, like Chris Stapleton, Lainey Wilson, and Kacey Musgraves. Her <em>Cowboy Carter </em>collaborators Post Malone and Shaboozey are also nominated against her, and they did receive CMA nominations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyonce-s-biggest-snubs">Beyonce&#8217;s Biggest Snubs</h2>



<p>Even though she hasn&#8217;t won many awards in the General Field, Beyonce has popped up as a nominee countless times. In more recent years, there&#8217;s been outrage over Bey&#8217;s losses in those categories.</p>



<p>One of Beyonce&#8217;s first major losses was in 2015. She lost the Album of the Year award for her self-titled album to Beck&#8217;s <em>Morning Phase.</em> Still, she gracefully accepted the loss, but the same couldn&#8217;t be said for everyone.</p>

<p>After Beck won, Kanye West <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4jEpVCGqSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charged the stage,</a> seemingly in a repeat from his 2009 VMAs incident. After getting on stage, Ye smiled and headed back into the audience. He didn&#8217;t escalate the situation any further.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Beck seemed to take it in good fun. He even gestured for Kanye to come back on stage, but the rapper didn&#8217;t take him up on the offer.</p>



<p>After the show, Kanye explained his thoughts in an <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/623519/kanye-west-goes-off-on-beck-s-grammy-win-he-should-have-given-his-award-to-beyonce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with <em>E! News</em>. &#8220;Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyonce,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Another major loss came in 2017. Beyonce&#8217;s album <em>Lemonade</em> was a critical hit. The album topped many outlets&#8217; year-end lists. The record was definitely favored to come out on top at the Grammys.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Adele won for her album <em>25. </em>As she accepted the award, the &#8220;Someone Like You&#8221; singer showed that she thought Beyonce should&#8217;ve won.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>During her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctuggqUSITM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>, Adele showed plenty of love for Queen B. &#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly accept this award,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very humble, and I&#8217;m very grateful and gracious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My artist of my life is Beyonce, and this album to me, the <em>Lemonade</em> album, is just so monumental,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All us artists here, we f**king adore you. You are our light.&#8221;</p>



<p> After her speech, Adele broke her Grammy to share in the glory with Beyonce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jay-z-speaks-out-against-the-grammys">Jay-Z Speaks Out Against The Grammys</h2>



<p>In 2024, Beyonce&#8217;s husband Jay-Z received the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the Grammys. After showing thanks, the rapper took a shot at the Recording Academy during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6dBQ2UM6JI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speech</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>After speaking about instances where rappers boycotted the Grammys, Jay called out the establishment. &#8220;We want y&#8217;all to get it right. We love y&#8217;all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s subjective. It&#8217;s music, and it&#8217;s opinion-based.&#8221;</p>



<p>As he continued, Jay spoke about Beyonce. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year. So, even by your own metrics that doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p> &#8220;Think about that: most Grammys, never won Album of the Year. It doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyonce has mostly let her snubs roll off her back. That being said, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/beyonces-cowboy-carter-album-cameos-from-dolly-parton-rumi-carter-leave-fans-reeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her album <em>Cowboy Carter</em></a><em> </em>responds to some of her past snubs.</p>



<p>In the opening song &#8220;American Requiem,&#8221; Beyonce claps back at critics. &#8220;Used to say I spoke too country/And the rejection came, said I wasn&#8217;t country enough,&#8221; she sings.</p>



<p>The line <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/luke-bryan-beyonce-diss-beyhive-american-idol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">references the backlash </a>that Beyonce received for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/beyonce-snubbed-by-country-music-awards-beyhive-vows-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performing at the CMA Awards</a> in 2016 with The Chicks. Following the performance, some fans spoke out against Bey&#8217;s inclusion in the award show.</p>



<p>The line also seems to clap back at the Grammys. The Academy rejected her song &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s Home&#8221; from the country categories. After her CMA snubs, the line feels even more fitting on the album. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-awards-is-she-nominated-for-this-year">What Awards Is She Nominated For This Year?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, Beyonce is up for 11 awards at the 2025 Grammys. If she wins any, she&#8217;ll greatly expand her lead as the most awarded artist.</p>



<p>All three of the major categories have Beyonce nominations. She&#8217;s up for Album of the Year for <em>Cowboy Carter</em>, while &#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em&#8221; is up for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year.</p>



<p>Besides those two, Beyonce is up for the following awards: Best Country Album (<em>Cowboy Carter</em>), Best Country Song (&#8220;Texas Hold &#8216;Em&#8221;), Best Pop Solo Performance (&#8220;Bodyguard&#8221;), Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (&#8220;Levii&#8217;s Jeans&#8221;), <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/shaboozey-who-is-the-hip-hop-country-artist-featured-on-beyonces-cowboy-carter-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Melodic Rap Performance (&#8220;Spaghettii</a>&#8220;), Best Country Solo Performance (&#8220;16 Carriages&#8221;), Best Country Duo/Group Performance (&#8220;II Most Wanted&#8221;), and Best Americana Performance (&#8220;Ya Ya&#8221;). </p>



<p>This year, the Beyhive is definitely rooting for her in every category!</p>

<p>Chris Brown getting nominated for (more) Grammys is earning major backlash. Well-deserved backlash.</p>



<p>Chris Brown has been accused of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/06/chris-brown-under-investigation-for-hitting-yet-another-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous wrongdoings</a>, including <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/chris-brown-sued-for-50-million-accused-of-beating-up-own-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beating up his own fans</a>. He pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna in 2009, confirming the criminal charges against him at that time. </p>



<p>Which means that Chris Brown is not an &#8220;alleged&#8221; monster; he&#8217;s just a monster. It is known.</p>



<p>And yet &#8230; the industry does <em>not </em>seem to care. Neither do whichever people actually keep buying his music.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gross-chris-brown-has-been-nominated-for-more-grammys">Gross! Chris Brown has been nominated for more Grammys</h2>



<p>The Grammy Awards are tonight, and many of the nominated names are exactly who you&#8217;d expect after a solid year for music.</p>



<p>Obviously, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter are up for Grammys. Beyonce is once again a music industry MVP, even if <em>some </em>awards shows have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/beyonce-snubbed-by-country-music-awards-beyhive-vows-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snubbed her</a>.</p>



<p>Charlie XCX. Taylor Swift. Billie Eilish. All music that normal people with taste likely listened to (even if not everyone listens to all of or only this music, of course!)</p>

<p>But then, the Grammy nominations take a bitter twist.</p>



<p>For Best R&amp;B Performance, Chris Brown has a nomination for &#8220;Residuals.&#8221; For Best R&amp;B Album, Chris Brown has a nomination for <em>11:11 (Deluxe)</em>. </p>



<p>The Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song includes another nomination. Chris Brown was one of the people who worked on &#8220;Praise.&#8221; And for Best African Music performance, Chris Brown has a Grammy nomination for &#8220;Sensational.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obviously-chris-brown-getting-grammy-nominations-is-getting-well-deserved-backlash">Obviously, Chris Brown getting Grammy nominations is getting well-deserved backlash</h2>



<p>Even though Twitter is in its death spiral as a platform, <a href="https://x.com/OnikaGauff/status/1854937524407611466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> after <a href="https://x.com/vigcup/status/1854938018865369455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> is calling out the Grammy Awards for nominating Chris Brown.</p>



<p>An <em>admitted </em>domestic abuser who has been accused of having other victims will very likely get to walk onto the stage at the next Grammys and hold up an award.</p>



<p>Some of his accusers may be in the audience. Alleged victims who&#8217;ve never come forward may be there. <em>Future </em>potential victims might be there, think that he must be an okay person, and find out the hard way that he is not. Whatever happened to the &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; that awful dudes are always whining about?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="678" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02.png" alt="A dark mode Twitter screenshot of people lamenting Chris Brown's Grammys nominations in 2024." class="wp-image-512962" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02.png 893w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02-300x228.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02-768x583.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Twitter, people lamented that the Grammy Awards don&#8217;t seem to care about right and wrong &#8212; not more than they care about honoring Chris Brown, anyway.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The grim reality, of course, is that &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; as so many people mean it never actually existed. And that&#8217;s unfortunate.</p>



<p>Yes, there are absolutely people who spend their free time calling out others on social media. Usually, it&#8217;s for clout, and can be for invented reasons &#8212; fandom disagreements and the like. In that sense, sure, &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; exists. But that&#8217;s not what people mean when they say it.</p>



<p>The &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; towards sexual predators, abusers, and other monsters? If <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/whoopi-goldberg-refuses-to-say-trump-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent political events</a> have taught us nothing else, it&#8217;s that we don&#8217;t live in a good enough or just enough society for most of the evil in our midst to face meaningful consequences.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="921" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1024x921.jpg" alt="Chris Brown on August 3, 2024." class="wp-image-512960" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1024x921.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-300x270.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-768x691.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-2048x1843.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-960x864.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1080x972.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1200x1080.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Brown performs during The 11:11 Tour at T-Mobile Arena on August 03, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mindy Small/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cancel-culture-isn-t-just-a-myth-it-s-a-grift">&#8216;Cancel culture&#8217; isn&#8217;t just a myth; it&#8217;s a grift</h2>



<p>In fact, for years now, claims that someone is &#8220;silenced&#8221; or &#8220;deplatformed&#8221; or &#8220;canceled&#8221; have been nothing short of farcical.</p>



<p>The running joke is that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/dave-chappelle-first-avenue-show-canceled-after-pushback-from-staff-patrons-performers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these men</a> get their own speaking tours, their own Netflix comedy specials, their own news segments, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/louis-ck-wins-grammy-cancel-culture-for-will-smith-but-not-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their own Grammys</a>. All so that they can discuss just how much &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; has harmed them. There&#8217;s an entire industry that has cropped up around grifters coasting on the claim that they&#8217;ve been unjustly &#8220;canceled.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the case of Chris Brown, he&#8217;s up for a Grammy Award. Again. Because people keep buying his music. They keep going to his concerts. And then record companies and members of the academy keep nominating him for awards that he could <em>never </em>deserve.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift has a new album coming in 2024.</p>



<p>Not a re-recording. Not a Taylor&#8217;s version. A NEW ALBUM. </p>



<p>And Swiftie&#8217;s hearts stopped EVERYWHERE!</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything we know so far about her upcoming 11th record.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-s-new-album-surprise-announcement-at-the-grammys">Taylor Swift&#8217;s New Album: Surprise Announcement At The Grammys</h2>



<p>Taylor made a big entrance to the Grammys, despite not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-grammys-travis-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having Travis Kelce </a>on her arm.</p>



<p>But then, she doubled down on making history at the award show by making a huge announcement.</p>



<p>After winning her 13th Grammy &#8211; her lucky number, I don&#8217;t know if you knew that &#8211; she got on stage to thank all the voters for the honor, but more importantly, the fans.</p>

<p>And to thank the fans properly, she gave them the one thing they&#8217;ve been waiting for for the last two years: a new album.</p>



<p>Right there, on stage, Taylor announced the name and release date of her brand new record, as well as promised to post the album cover from backstage.</p>



<p>And Taylor always lives up to her promises!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-album-title-the-tortured-poets-department-the-release-date-soon">The Album Title? &#8216;The Tortured Poets Department&#8217; The Release Date? SOON!</h2>



<p>&#8220;All’s fair in love and poetry&#8221;</p>

<p>Long before she started <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-happy-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating Travis Kelce</a>, Taylor Swift was romantically involved with Calvin Harris.</p>



<p>In celebrity gossip terms, that relationship ended about 400 years ago, but running into an ex is always an awkward experience, even for the most famous musical artist on the planet.</p>



<p>Yes, as you&#8217;ve likely heard by now, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/celine-dion-grammys-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Grammys</a> were held last night, and once again, it was a victorious night for Taylor.</p>



<p>In fact, it was a <em>historic</em> night for the pop icon, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-new-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor announced her eleventh studio album</a> and became the first artist ever to win Album of the Year four times.</p>

<p>Sadly, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-grammys-travis-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce was unable to attend the Grammys</a>, as he&#8217;s having a big week of his own, preparing to play in his fourth Super Bowl.</p>



<p>But at least one of Taylor&#8217;s famous exes was present for her big night.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it seems that Tay was able to keep her distance from Calvin.</p>

<p>As Twitter/X users were quick to point out, Taylor and Calvin &#8212; who dated from 2015 to 2016 &#8212; were seated in the same section during the ceremony.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the exes were far enough apart that they wouldn&#8217;t be forced to make small talk during commercial breaks.</p>



<p>But that didn&#8217;t stop Taylor and Calvin from being roped into a viral moment together.</p>

<p>During SZA&#8217;s performance of &#8220;Kill Bill,&#8221; one viewer noted that <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleyNicole_23/status/1754318468789207424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor was standing and singing along in plain view of Calvin</a>.</p>



<p>You might be wondering what the big deal is, as Taylor stood and sang along during many of the night&#8217;s big performances.</p>



<p>But the performance contained the memorable lyrics &#8220;I just killed my ex,&#8221; a line that appeared to bring a smile to Taylor&#8217;s face.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-s-historic-night">Taylor&#8217;s Historic Night</h2>



<p>Thankfully, no ancient breakup drama could overshadow Taylor&#8217;s achievements at the Grammys.</p>



<p>It was one of the biggest nights of her career, and it&#8217;s one that Swifties will surely be discussing for years to come.</p>

<p>And now, Taylor and Travis are poised to have the biggest power couple week in history.</p>



<p>If he leads the Kansas City Chiefs to another Super Bowl victory the same week that she became one of the winningest artists in Grammys history, then there&#8217;s officially no one else on the planet who can compete with these two.</p>



<p>Some fans think <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-engaged-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis will propose to Taylor</a> if his team wins, but that might be overdoing it.</p>



<p>After all, it&#8217;s good to save something for the offseason, and Tay doesn&#8217;t need to be promoting an album and planning a wedding at the same time!</p>

<p>To say say Taylor Swift is a Grammy winner is an understatement. </p>



<p>More accurately, she is a historic Grammy winner, and in 2024, she broke of the biggest records in award show history.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/taylor-swift-grammys-travis-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce wasn&#8217;t on her arm for the big show</a>, Taylor was the talk of the night at this year&#8217;s show, not only winning several more gramophones, but celebrating the news with a HUGE announcement. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at Taylor&#8217;s winning history. How many Grammys does Taylor have? The answer, truthfully, is NEVER ENOUGH!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-has-been-grammy-nominated-52-times">Taylor Has Been Grammy-Nominated 52 Times</h2>



<p>Taylor ranks as one of the most nominated acts in pop music. She has been nominated 52 times for her work over 10 albums.</p>

<p>She nabbed her first nomination in 2008, for Best New Artist. Although she didn&#8217;t win, it wasn&#8217;t long before she had a golden gramophone to show off. </p>



<p>Two years later, she won 4 Grammys out of 8 nominations for her work on the album <em>Fearless</em>. And things just took of from there!</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, 1989 garnered her the most nominations (10), while Reputation was wildly disrespected with only one nomination in 2019.</p>



<p>Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate &#8212; but lovers are going to elevate when the the TV version drops this year!</p>

<p>Out of those 52 nominations, Taylor has won 14 Grammys so far. </p>



<p>Of those wins, four of them were for Album Of The Year. She won the award for 2009 for <em>Fearless,</em> again for 2015 for <em>1989</em> and, then 2020 for <em>Folklore</em>.</p>



<p>She is the first and only female solo artist to accomplish this feat, and then she made history with the 2024 show.</p>



<p>Taylor became the first artist ever, in the history of the award show, to win <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/celine-dion-grammys-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four Album of The Year awards</a> with her win for <em>Midnights</em> in 2024. </p>



<p>She also won her 13th (lucky number!) award earlier in the night for Best Pop Album, also for Midnights. In her acceptance speech, she announced she&#8217;d be coming for the 2025 awards next year.</p>



<p>Yes, another <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-new-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new album</a> is on the way &#8211; and it&#8217;s coming FAST!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that famous adversary Kanye West does out pace Taylor in the wins department. He has 24 wins over her 12. </p>



<p>But no one can touch Beyonce, who is the most decorated Grammy winner with 32 wins. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2024-grammy-performers">2024 Grammy Performers</h2>



<p>Win or lose, the Grammys this year is all about the performances.</p>



<p>Legends like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/joni-mitchell-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joni Mitchel</a>l, Billy Joel, and U2 are all set to take the stage, alongside new favorites like SZA, Dua Lipa, and Billie Eilish.</p>



<p>Olivia Rodrigo, and Luke Combs round out the rooster, along with Travis Scott and Burna Boy.</p>



<p>But the big talk of the night was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/tracy-chapman-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracy Chapman joining Luke Coombs </a>on stage for a <em>Fast Car</em> duet!</p>



<p>Sadly, Taylor is not slated to perform, though there was as a rumor she&#8217;d pop on stage with SZA. We&#8217;ll keep our fingers crossed. </p>

<p>While some had thought it might be Britney, the world was equally as thrilled to see Celine take the stage, looking healthy and full of light and love.</p>



<p>Celine looked out to see every person in the room on their feet and thanked them for their grace.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you right back. You’re beautiful,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>As she looked out to the audience, she added:</p>



<p>&#8220;When I say the I’m happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart. </p>

<p>Those who have been blessed to be here, must never take for granted the tremendous  love and joy that music brings to our lives and people around the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then presented Album of the Year to Taylor Swift, who made history with the win. </p>

<p>Earlier in the week, Celine announced she would be slowly returning to the spotlight, not only as a means to &#8220;continue&#8221; her career, but to shed light on her<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/celine-dion-sister-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> life with Stiff Person Syndrome</a> (SPS).</p>



<p>In her first statement in months, Celine lets her fans in on how she&#8217;s doing, but also some big plans on the horizon.</p>



<p>“This last couple of years has been such a challenge for me, the journey from discovering my condition to learning how to live with and manage it, but not to let it define me,” said Celine Dion in a new statement released by her team.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to reach out to you,” Celine said in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl5xJY1AjAO/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;video at the time. “I miss you all so much and I can’t wait to be&nbsp;on stage&nbsp;talking to you in person. As you know, I’ve always been an open book and I wasn’t ready to say anything before. But I’m ready now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been dealing with problems with my health for a long time and it’s been really difficult for me to face these challenges and to talk about everything that I’ve been going through. Recently, I’ve been diagnosed with a very rare neurological disorder called stiff person syndrome, which affects something like one in a million people.”</p>



<p>While her  sister Claudette was more somber speaking to reporters in December, earlier in the year, she reminded fans of just how tough her sister is. Speaking with a local news outlet in Canada about her sister’s health, as reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2023/02/01/63dab1c146163fa64f8b4573.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Marca,&nbsp;</em></a>in January of 2023, she said, &#8220;I am confident that life will give her back what she gave because she is an extremely intelligent woman, very generous and talented and in love with life as well.” </p>
