<p>We have another unsettling update about the bizarre <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-wife-and-dog-found-dead-in-santa-fe-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deaths of Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa</a>.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, the Hollywood legend and his wife were found dead in their Santa Fe home last month.</p>



<p>After days of mystery and speculation, investigators concluded that Arakawa probably passed away, and Hackman&#8217;s dementia had progressed to the point that he was unable to seek help.</p>



<p>Now, there&#8217;s another strange wrinkle to the story, as Hackman and Arakawa&#8217;s bodies remain unclaimed several weeks after they were found.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bodies-of-gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-remain-at-local-morgue">Bodies of Gene Hackman, Betsy Arakawa remain at local morgue</h2>



<p>The bodies were discovered on February 27.</p>



<p>And according to a new report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/27/gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-bodies-still-unclaimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, their bodies are still in the custody of the New Mexico Office of the Medical Examiner.</p>



<p>The office&#8217;s list of unclaimed decedents is updated online every Monday. Hackman and Arakawa were still on the list as of Monday.</p>



<p>TMZ reports that they&#8217;re still there as of today, but the outlet&#8217;s method of arriving at that conclusion is unclear.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="731" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-51708076-731x1024.jpg" alt='US actor Gene Hackman arrives at the premiere of his new film "The Royal Tenenbaums," in Los Angeles, 06 December 2001.

<p>Investigators estimate that Hackman passed away on February 17 or 18, meaning it&#8217;s been nearly six weeks since he died.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s been even longer for Arakawa, who is believed to have passed away at least one week earlier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-have-hackman-and-arakawa-s-bodies-remained-unclaimed">Why have Hackman and Arakawa&#8217;s bodies remained unclaimed?</h2>



<p>The coroner&#8217;s office assures TMZ that it&#8217;s not unusual for bodies to remain at the morgue for several weeks.</p>

<p>But it <em>is</em> unusual for a famous figure such as Gene Hackman to remain unburied so long after his high-profile death.</p>



<p>The likeliest explanation is that funeral arrangements are still being made. </p>



<p>Hackman had three adult children, but none of them live in New Mexico, so the process might be taking longer than expected.</p>



<p>There are complications involving <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/gene-hackmans-kids-not-named-in-will-who-will-inherit-his-80-million-fortune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hackman&#8217;s will</a>, as he named Betsy as his sole beneficiary, meaning that his kids will likely need the help of attorneys to sort out the division of Gene&#8217;s $80 million fortune.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="691" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-81800241-691x1024.jpg" alt="Gene Hackman attends an ESPN event ahead of Super Bowl XXXIX.

<p>That probably doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the delayed funeral plans.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s worth noting that in past interviews, Hackman had spoken about his distant relationship with his kids.</p>



<p>The fact that he and Betsy were dead for over a week before they were found by maintenance workers indicates a certain level of estrangement.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean there was any sort of bad blood, and TMZ reports that Gene repaired his relationship with his kids in the later years of his life.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been over two weeks since <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/14/gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-will-estate-children/?adid=social-tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gene Hackman was found dead</a> alongside wife Betsy Arakawa inside the couple&#8217;s Santa Fe home.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-cause-of-death-police-request-warrant-describe-actors-demise-as-suspicious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cause of Hackman and Arakawa&#8217;s deaths</a> was initially unclear, but it now looks as though she passed away from a rare virus. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/gene-hackman-cause-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hackman was suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s</a> and, unable to seek help, he passed away roughly one week later.</p>

<p>Now, a new mystery has emerged, as there are questions as to who will inherit Hackman&#8217;s $80 million fortune.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-hackman-s-will-makes-no-mention-of-his-children">Gene Hackman&#8217;s will makes no mention of his children</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/14/gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-will-estate-children/?adid=social-tw">TMZ</a>, Hackman&#8217;s three children &#8212; son Christopher, 65, and daughters Leslie, 58, and Elizabeth, 62, all by his first wife, Faye Maltese &#8212; are not named as beneficiaries.</p>



<p>The actor&#8217;s fortune &#8212; which is estimated at roughly $80 million &#8212; was supposed to pass to Betsy, who was 30 years his junior.</p>

<p>Arawaka did not have any children of her own, which might simplify matters somewhat.</p>



<p>But according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/14/celebrity-news/gene-hackman-wife-betsy-arakawas-wills-revealed-80m-fortune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, there&#8217;s already &#8220;a legal battle brewing&#8221; between Christopher Hackman and his two sisters.</p>



<p>The outlet reports that the eldest Hackman &#8220;has hired a high-powered attorney&#8221; and is prepared to defend his interests by whatever means necessary.</p>

<p>Attorney Julia Peters has been appointed executor of the will, and it seems she&#8217;s doing her best to keep the matter private.</p>



<p>Page Six reports that Peters has also filed paperwork to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s specifically seeking to prevent the release of photographs and police body-camera video from the scene.</p>



<p>Once again, the story surrounding Hackman&#8217;s death is beginning to sound more like the plot from one of his movies.</p>

<p>First, the investigation into his passing makes headlines for weeks. And now, the battle over his fortune could prove equally dramatic.</p>



<p>We hope that this matter will be resolved quickly, and that Hackman&#8217;s family, friends, and fans can finally find closure.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since the world learned about the shocking <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-wife-and-dog-found-dead-in-santa-fe-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa</a>.</p>



<p>And for most of that time, the circumstances surrounding those deaths were completely baffling to investigators.</p>



<p>Hackman was 95, so normally, his passing would not merit much of an investigation. But his late wife was only 65, with no known health issues.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="707" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-707x1024.jpg" alt="Gene Hackman arrives at the 60th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, CA  on January 19, 2003." class="wp-image-520795" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-707x1024.jpg 707w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-768x1112.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-1414x2048.jpg 1414w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-663x960.jpg 663w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-746x1080.jpg 746w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-829x1200.jpg 829w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2266610-1-scaled.jpg 1768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gene Hackman arrives at the 60th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, CA  on January 19, 2003.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-hackman-and-betsy-arakawa-s-causes-of-death-revealed">Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa&#8217;s causes of death revealed</h2>



<p>Earlier today, the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/03/07/gene-hackman-cause-of-death-wife/80684790007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the findings</a> of the couple&#8217;s autopsies.</p>



<p>The examiner announced that Hackman died of heart disease and complications caused by Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Arakawa passed away from a rare illness known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. It is usually spread by rodents.</p>



<p>The medical examiner estimates that Hackman died on February 18, roughly one week after Arakawa.</p>



<p>. Obviously, there are still many questions to be answered about this highly unusual case.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="731" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1232804326-731x1024.jpg" alt='Gene Hackman arrives at the premiere of his new film "The Royal Tenenbaums," in Los Angeles, 06 December 2001.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-hackman-and-betsy-arakawa-death-scene-continues-to-confound-investigators">Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa death scene continues to confound investigators</h2>



<p>Adding to the mystery is the fact that the Hollywood legend and his late wife were found dead in different parts of the house.</p>



<p>One of the couple&#8217;s dogs had passed away, but two others were still roaming the property.</p>



<p>Initially, many presumed that the deaths were the result of a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-cause-of-death-police-request-warrant-describe-actors-demise-as-suspicious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning</a>, but those theories were eventually ruled out.</p>



<p>Now, a professional medical examiner is positing a new possibility that might help explain how two seemingly unrelated deaths happened one week apart in the same residence.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-medical-examiner-says-deaths-may-have-been-the-result-of-broken-heart-type-situation">Medical examiner says deaths may have been the result of &#8216;broken heart-type&#8217; situation</h2>



<p>James Gill is the Chief Medical Examiner of the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. He&#8217;s <em>not</em> participating in the investigation into Hackman and Arakawa&#8217;s deaths, but ahead of the official findings, he shared his informed outsider&#8217;s theory with <em><a href="https://people.com/gene-hackman-wife-betsy-broken-heart-type-thing-pathologist-says-exclusive-11691662">People</a></em> magazine.</p>



<p>“From the initial kind of circumstances, it seems like he may have collapsed. He&#8217;s got a history of heart disease. He&#8217;s got a pacemaker. So that would not be unusual,&#8221; Gill explains.</p>



<p>&#8220;But the unusual part is that why then did she also collapse? Assuming she would&#8217;ve found him. Then you start wondering about: There is this thing where the stress of seeing someone die that could have triggered a natural death in her.”</p>



<p>Gill says the most likelt possibility is that Hackman &#8220;found [Arakawa] and was going out to get help or get his phone, and he then collapsed from the stress of that, too. Just as likely. He&#8217;s older, he’s got known heart disease. But the autopsy would certainly show if she had heart disease or cancer or what have you.”</p>

<p>The ME explains that two natural deaths occurring around the same time “has been known to happen, kind of a broken heart-type thing, almost.”</p>



<p>“Suddenly finding your loved one dead on the floor that can increase your adrenaline and that stimulates your heart to beat faster, and that can put your heart into an irregular rhythm,” he says.</p>



<p>Gill notes that prescription pills were found scattered near Betsy&#8217;s body, a detail that could be a clue. Perhaps she was engaged in a last-ditch effort to treat a known, existing illness.</p>



<p>He explains that after finding a loved one, “people get very despondent and they do something to take their own life, and that may be with pills or what have you. I think the toxicology workup will be helpful in excluding causes such as an intoxication or injuries.”</p>



<p>It now seems likely that Hackman was unable to seek help or alert the authorities to Arakawa&#8217;s death because of his advanced Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Gill concluded by cautioning that we won&#8217;t have the full story until medical examiners complete their investigation.</p>



<p>“I think the autopsy and the toxicology testing is what&#8217;s needed to be seen in order to make that final determination,” he says.</p>



<p> “Otherwise, it&#8217;s kind of speculation at this point.”</p>



<p>Since he made those remarks, the ME&#8217;s office has announced their findings, but alas, many questions remain.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-wife-and-dog-found-dead-in-santa-fe-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gene Hackman passed away</a> at the age of 95 this week.</p>



<p>Hackman was a Hollywood legend with two Oscars and countless incredible performances to his name. But his death is generating headlines for reasons that have nothing to do with his career accomplishments.</p>



<p>The actor was found dead alongside his wife, Betsy Arakawa, and one of the couple&#8217;s dogs.</p>



<p>Police have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-cause-of-death-police-request-warrant-describe-actors-demise-as-suspicious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deemed the circumstances &#8220;suspicious,&#8221;</a> and the more we find out about his bizarre case, the more  questions we&#8217;re left with.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-hackman-s-mysterious-death-continues-to-confound-fans">Gene Hackman&#8217;s mysterious death continues to confound fans</h2>



<p>When word got out that Hackman&#8217;s wife and dog were also among the deceased, many assumed that a gas or carbon monoxide leak had caused their deaths.</p>



<p>But while investigators have not definitively ruled out any possibilities, the noxious fumes theory is not as convincing as it used to be.</p>



<p>Two other dogs were alive and well when police arrived, and prescription pills were reportedly scattered near Arakawa&#8217;s body.</p>



<p>As police and journalists continue to try and make sense of this tragedy, members of Hackman&#8217;s family have come forward to reveal that they&#8217;re just as baffled as anyone.</p>

<p>Speaking with the <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14444245/gene-hackman-daughter-breaks-silence-reclusive-father-mysterious-death.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a></em>, Hackman&#8217;s daughter Leslie revealed that he had no known health issues in the months leading up to his death.</p>



<p>&#8220;Despite his age, he was in very good physical condition,&#8221; she revealed, while adding that her father had not undergone any recent medical procedures.</p>



<p>&#8220;He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week. So he was in good health.</p>



<p>She noted that his death was &#8220;not terribly shocking because he was 95.&#8221; Of course, the same cannot be said for Arakawa, who was only 64.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were close. I hadn&#8217;t talked to them for a couple months, but everything was normal, and everything was good,&#8221; Leslie said of her relationships with Gene and Betsy.</p>



<p>Leslie is a product of Hackman&#8217;s first marriage, but she says she became close to his second fire over the 34 years they were married. </p>



<p>She noted, as others have, that Betsy encouraged Gene to adopt a healthier lifestyle and adhere to a &#8220;strict&#8221; diet.</p>



<p>&#8220;They had a wonderful marriage. And I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive. Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;So I am appreciative to her for that, and I&#8217;m very saddened by her passing.&#8221;</p>



<p>It might be months before we have any definitive answers with regard to what killed Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa. The lack of closure surely only adds to their loved ones pain, and we wish them the best during this enormously difficult time.</p>

<p>Earlier today, we reported on the tragic news that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/gene-hackman-wife-and-dog-found-dead-in-santa-fe-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead</a> in their New Mexico home.</p>



<p>Hackman was 95, and Arakawa was 63.</p>



<p>One of the couple&#8217;s dogs was also found dead, a detail that&#8217;s led many to conclude that Hackman and Arakawa were victims of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>



<p>But new reports about the grisly scene have served to remind us that the deaths of this screen legend and his wife are still unexplained &#8212; and still mysterious.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-circumstances-surrounding-hackman-and-arakawa-s-deaths-have-been-described-as-suspicious">The circumstances surrounding Hackman and Arakawa&#8217;s deaths have been described as &#8216;suspicious&#8217;</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/27/gene-hackman-death-investigation-suspicious/#continued" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, the officers who responded to a welfare check call also found two <em>living</em> dogs inside the home.</p>



<p>Police requested a warrant to search the home, and the Santa Fe detective who wrote the request described Hackman and Arakawa&#8217;s deaths as &#8220;suspicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The death of the two deceased individuals to be suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation,&#8221; reads the request obtained by TMZ.</p>



<p>The detective adds that &#8220;the reporting party found the front door of the residence unsecured and opened, deputies observed a healthy dog running loose on the property, another healthy dog near the deceased female, a deceased dog laying 10-15 feet from the deceased female in a closet of the bathroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Additional suspicious details include &#8220;the heater being moved, the pill bottle being opened and pills scattered next to the female, the male decedent being located in a separate room of the residence, and no obvious signs of a gas leak.&#8221;</p>



<p>On social media, many users seeking to make sense of this tragedy noted that it&#8217;s been unusually cold in New Mexico. They posited that the weather might have caused the couple to turn up their heat, which may have resulted in a gas leak.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t appear to have been the case.</p>



<p>&#8220;As of now, there are no signs or evidence indicating there were any problems associated to the pipes in and around the residence,&#8221; reads a statement to TMZ by the New Mexico Gas Company.</p>

<p>The two bodies were found in different rooms, and investigators noted that Hackman seemed to have &#8220;suddenly fallen. The sunglasses that he appeared to have been wearing were found on the floor near his head.</p>



<p>Detectives made note of the prescription pill bottle that was found near Arakawa, but the nature of the medication remains unclear.</p>



<p>Needless to say, there&#8217;s a lot that we still don&#8217;t know about this situation.</p>



<p>We will have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>The actor and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, were BOTH found dead at their home in Santa Fe Summit on Wednesday, February 26, according to Santa Fe New Mexican, citing County Sheriff Adan Mendoza. </p>



<p>This same official confirmed to the outlet that the couple had died&#8230; along with their dog.</p>



<p>&#8220;Foul play is not suspected as a factor in those deaths at this time however exact cause of death has not been determined,&#8221; authorities said in a statement. &#8220;This is an active and ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office.&#8221;</p>

<p>No further details on their deaths have been shared publicly at this time.</p>



<p>Hackman garnered numerous accolades for his roles in films such as Superman and Unforgiven before stepping away from the spotlight.</p>



<p>He earned his first Oscar nomination (out of five) in 1968 for his role in Bonnie and Clyde.</p>



<p>The long-time star was born in in San Bernadino, California and served as a marine for five years before studying at the University of Illinois and then leaving the college to pursue acting at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. </p>

<p>Following the news of Hackman&#8217;s passing director Francis Ford Coppola was among the first to pay tribute to the actor, who he worked with on 1974&#8217;s The Conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration,&#8221; he captioned a photo with Hackman on February 27. &#8220;Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hackman narried Arakawa in 1991.</p>



<p>His last onscreen appearance was in 2004&#8217;s Welcome to Mooseport.</p>



<p>In 2004, Hackman told Larry King in an interview that his career was “probably all over,” and that he had no new scripts in front of him.</p>

<p>Hackman is survived by children Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie; all from his marriage to Faye Maltese.</p>



<p>Asked by GQ in 2011 as to how he would like to be remembered, Hackman replied as follows:</p>



<p>“As a decent actor. As someone who tried to portray what was given to them in an honest fashion. I don’t know, beyond that.”</p>



<p><strong>May Gene Hackman rest in peace.</strong></p>

<p>But the Oscar winner admitted to Santa Fe police yesterday that he slapped a homeless man across the face after he referred to his wife by a vulgar name on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The incident went down in New Mexico and was phoned in to the authorities by 63-year old Bruce Becker, the victim at the end of Hackman&#8217;s open palm.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>According to Sgt. Andrea Dobyns, Becker possesses an arrest record that includes counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and arson.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hackman told our officers that this homeless man assaulted him and his wife and called her a foul word,” <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/103112hackman#.UJEZHIV9kzP">Dobyns said</a>, adding that Hackman admitted to the slap, though there was no visible signs of injury on either party.</p>
<p>No charges have been filed against Hackman, as the police appear to believe his story about self-defense.</p>
<p>“He was afraid that he and his wife were going to be attacked,” Dobyns said.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the 81-year-old is alright and and on the mend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gene was airlifted (because he is on an island) to the hospital for routine tests,&#8221; the rep confirmed. &#8220;Everything is fine and Gene is on his way home now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actor suffered only &#8220;a few bumps and bruises.&#8221;</p>

<p>TMZ, which first reported the accident, said that the collision occurred at around 3 p.m. EST Friday, and the Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Gene was assigned a special hospital room for high-profile patients where doctors could keep a close eye on the star, who suffered a cut on his forehead.</p>
<p>Hackman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1971&#8217;s <em>The French Connection</em> and another Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1992&#8217;s <em>Unforgiven</em>.</p>
