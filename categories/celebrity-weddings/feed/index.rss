<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-on-saturday-katie-thurston-married-jeff-arcuri">On Saturday, Katie Thurston married Jeff Arcuri</h2>



<p><em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-thurston-marries-jeff-arcuri-amid-breast-cancer-battle-excl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em> reports that former <em>The Bachelorette</em> leading lady Katie Thurston married comedian Jeff Arcuri on Saturday, March 22.</p>



<p>Before that, the report details, Katie actually leaked the information &#8212; by accident &#8212; during an interview just two days earlier.</p>



<p>The topic was her stage 3 breast cancer diagnosis. As Katie discussed the impact of her treatments on their relationship, she spilled the proverbial beans.</p>

<p>“You would think it would cause more tribulation or problems between you,&#8221; Katie Thurston began.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it’s bonded us more than anything else,&#8221; she shared, &#8220;which is why we’re moving up the wedding a little bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, perhaps after realizing that she&#8217;d said more than she had intended, Katie specified: &#8220;We’re getting married in two days.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-timed-the-wedding-ahead-of-katie-thurston-s-cancer-treatments">They timed the wedding ahead of Katie Thurston&#8217;s cancer treatments</h2>



<p>A tearful Katie Thurston then gushed about Jeff Arcuri&#8217;s &#8220;sweet sentiment of being there for me&#8221; ahead of her new cancer treatments.</p>



<p>Starting on Thursday, March 27, Katie becomes part of the I-Spy breast cancer trial. This individualized treatment will likely include multiple rounds of chemo, followed by surgery. </p>



<p>“It was so sweet,&#8221; Katie described. &#8220;Obviously, we were wanting to plan a wedding. And there’s a lot of emotions that come in with chemo and the impact and the health and we don’t know what the next year looks like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Continuing the story, Katie Thurston shared how Jeff Arcuri had brought their wedding date even closer.</p>



<p>“And one night he said, ‘I want to show you that I still love you and that I’m here to stay. I’ll get married to you tomorrow,'&#8221; she recalled.</p>



<p>&#8220;We flew our parents in from Michigan and Washington State,&#8221; Katie detailed. She added: &#8220;We got our marriage license and a friend is just gonna marry us.”</p>

<p> “It was this kind gesture of him saying, truly, in sickness and in health,” Katie Thurston emphasized. “He is proving that he’s here to stay. He shows up every day and he does it in ways that just continue to surprise.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, cancer and other serious ailments are alarmingly common times for women to find that their partner or spouse has abandoned them. This couple is choosing a better path.</p>



<p>In addition to obtaining their marriage license and marrying, they are also planning a larger wedding ceremony &#8212; for after this cancer battle is over and won.</p>

<p>Abby and Brittany Hensel are conjoined twins. </p>



<p>They rose to some level of prominence way back in 1996 when they were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p>



<p>In 2012, the siblings starred on the TLC reality show Abby &amp; Brittany, providing viewers at the time with a closer glimpse at their lives and their extremely rare condition.</p>



<p>The sisters, who are dicephalus conjoined twins, were born fused together at the torso &#8212; and remain so as adults. </p>



<p>They have separate spinal cords, brains, hearts and other organs but share those located below the waist. Brittany controls the left side of their body, while Abby controls the right.</p>

<p>Truly astounding, right?</p>



<p>On March 27, meanwhile, The Today Show cited public records to prove that Abby has been married since 2021 to a man named Josh Bowling.</p>



<p>The spouses (and, yes, Brittany) reside in the twins’ native Minnesota; while Josh describes himself as a “father, veteran, nurse” on his Facebook page.</p>



<p>Following their graduation from Bethel University in 2012, the sisters began working as teachers at an elementary school. </p>



<p>Both Abby and Brittany obtained their own teaching license, although they explained they said years ago that they share a paycheck due to teaching the same classes because, again, they can&#8217;t be physically separated.</p>

<p>&#8220;People have been curious about us since we were born, for obvious reasons,&#8221; the twins said in the first episode of their eight-part series. </p>



<p>&#8220;But our parents never let us use that as an excuse. We were raised to believe we could do anything we wanted to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>This includes dating and, more recently, marriage, although the former reality stars have said they don&#8217;t wish to turn their private lives into a public spectacle.</p>



<p>&#8220;The whole world doesn&#8217;t need to know who we&#8217;re dating,&#8221; Brittany said on the 2006 documentary Joined for Life: Abby &amp; Brittany Turn 16. &#8220;Or what we&#8217;re gonna do and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the past, the twins also talked openly about parenthood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;re going to be moms,&#8221; Brittany said on the aforementioned documentary. </p>



<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t thought about how being moms is going to work yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s official: Christine Brown is no longer a sister wife.</p>



<p>Because she is now, officially, someone else&#8217;s wife!</p>



<p>On October 7, just under two years since she walked away from an unhappy spiritual union, the TLC personality exchanged vows with David Woolley.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fairytale,&#8221; Brown told People Magazine shortly after this lovely wedding ceremony.</p>

<p>Continued the mother of six:</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s everything I never thought I would have. I get to walk down the aisle to David, him just looking at me the way that he does, it’s a dream come true.”</p>



<p>Christine dumped Kody Brown in November 2021, stating back then:</p>



<p><em>After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave. We will continue to be a strong presence in each other’s lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family. </em></p>



<p><em>At this time, we ask for your grace and kindness as we navigate through this stage within our family</em></p>

<p>As for other details from the big, magical day?</p>

<p>The couple met about a year and a half ago on a dating website.</p>



<p>Woolley proposed in April of this year, prompting an acceptance from Christine, along with the following quote:</p>



<p>&#8220;David treats me like a queen and tells me I&#8217;m beautiful every day.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been in love like this before, and the world seems like a brighter place with him in it.&#8221;</p>

That seems to sum up Christine Brown and David Woolley.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On numerous occasions since, Christine has told the world why she loves David and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/christine-brown-emphasizes-one-huge-difference-between-david-woolley-and-kody-brown/">how he is different from Kody</a>.</p>



<p>After sharing a kiss on Saturday, the spouses were introduced as Mr. and Mrs. Woolley to cheers from the crowd as &#8220;At Last&#8221; by Etta James played.</p>



<p>People even reports that sparkling apple cider and champagne were served during the cocktail hour, not to mention Moscow mules and mojitos.</p>



<p>There was then a buffet dinner that included roast beef, BBQ chicken, cowboy potatoes, baked beans and corn on the cob. Yum!</p>

<p>Woolley is a widow with eight kids, and he&#8217;s very much in love.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m really very lucky, and very happy that someone let her go, because she&#8217;s a unicorn,” he told People. &#8220;After my wife passed away, I dated and I just could never find somebody. </p>



<p>&#8220;I knew Christine was The One. It just feels so right.”</p>

<p>Kody Brown has not yet commented on the marriage of his ex-spouse, but the former couple&#8217;s children seemingly love Christine&#8217;s new husband.</p>



<p>Over the summer, Christine and Woolley enjoyed a family vacation with four of her kids in London. </p>



<p>&#8220;What wonderful new experiences with some of my favorite people,&#8221; Christine wrote on Instagram July 28. </p>

<p>Selling Sunset&#8217;s Jason Oppenheim confirmed quite pleasant news on his Instagram Story a short time after vows were exchanged, sharing a video of the happy couple.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congrats to Dylan &amp; Hannah on the most beautiful Parisian wedding ever!!!&#8221; he captioned the footage.</p>



<p>As you can see below, Oppenheim also posted a clip of the newlyweds sharing a kiss after saying <em><strong>I do</strong></em>, as Godwin, holds up a glass of champagne in the video as Barbour gives her a dip in front of the crowd.</p>

<p>The reality stars met on Season 6 of Bachelor In Paradise, which premiered in August 2019. </p>



<p>Although Godwin initially showed romantic interest in Blake Horstmann, her connection with Barbour was much more powerful in the end &#8230; and the twosome actually got engaged during the show’s season finale.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was really excited to meet her, and I think I had some preconceived notions about her. When I met her, she just completely blew me out of the water,&#8221; Barbour told Entertainment Tonight after he proposed.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s just amazing. She has so many layers to her and I&#8217;m just happy everybody is gonna get to see that even more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following their run on the aforementioned ABC program, the couple decided on a long distance relationship while Godwin was located in Los Angeles and her boyfriend was residing in San Diego. </p>



<p>However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pair found themselves unexpectedly quarantined together in March 2020.</p>



<p>“Luckily, we’re both easygoing so being trapped in sweats all day with my BFF isn’t a bad day,” Godwin told Us Weekly in March 2020, while Barbour added back then: </p>



<p>“It makes us want to live together and puppy fever is through the roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved in together in November 2020 &#8212; and the rest is precious history.</p>



<p>Just a week ago, the couple got engaged for a second time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although our first engagement was and still is SO special to us, over the past 4 years we&#8217;ve talked about having a special little moment just for us in the real world, and @dylanbarbour surprised me and made it happen last week,&#8221; Godwin wrote on Instagram.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now off to our wedding location today to tie the knot!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clare Crawley is no longer The Bachelorette.</p>



<p>And she&#8217;s no longer <em>a</em> Bachelorette, either.</p>



<p>The former ABC lead married Mascot Sports CEO Ryan Dawkins in an intimate ceremony in Sacramento, California, on February 1, according to both People Magazine&#8230; and Crawley herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. And Mrs. Dawkins!&#8221; Crawley captioned the following photo from her special day with Dawkins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clare Crawley is a married woman. And she looks rather happy about that, doesn&#8217;t she?</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ex-Bachelorette, who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clare-crawley-engaged-to-someone-named-ryan-dawkins/">got engaged to Dawkins in October</a>, also spoke to People about her nuptials.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I had to do this day over every single day for the rest of my life… I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing!&#8221; Clare told this outlet, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;Happiest day of my life hands down!&#8221;</p>



<p>Crawley rose to small screen fame after one of the more unique Bachelorette runs in history: She accepted a proposal from Dale Moss after just four weeks of filming and then walked away from the franchise immediately afterward.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dale Moss and Clare Crawley kissed to celebrate their engagement. But they have since split up.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It remains unclear exactly what drove Crawley and Moss apart, but the former dragged the latter very hard in late 2021.</p>



<p>&#8220;I trusted somebody,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/10/clare-crawley-continues-to-drag-dale-moss-he-knows-what-he-did/">Clare said of Dale at the time</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I believed somebody that they were who that they said they were [and] that they would hold up to the promises that they make when they get down on one knee.&#8221;</p>



<p>Back to happier times for Crawley, though, okay?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Back in October, after the aforementioned engagement in Las Vegas, Crawley wrote on Instagram:</p>



<p>&#8220;He has held me in my darkness, loves me through my healing, and we now celebrate the light together. The easiest YES of my life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dawkins later spoke to Us Weekly and gushed like man over his now-wife.</p>



<p>“Everything in my world has changed since I met her, she’s the love of my life and I wish the world knew the Clare that I know,” he told the tabloid at the time. </p>



<p>“She is one of the strongest women I know and is truly a light. I love our life and [am] beyond excited about our future.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Crawley initially appeared on the The Bachelor in 2014 during Season 18, competing for Juan Pablo Galavis’ heart and affection.</p>



<p>She was sent home heartbroken during the finale.</p>



<p>She also was part of the first two seasons of Bachelor in Paradise in 2014 and 2015, but did not find love either time.</p>



<p>Crawley then went on to win Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Benoit Beauséjour-Savard in 2018. The two got engaged a short while later, but broke up after just three months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Why will it work this time around with Dawkins?</p>



<p>“He brings so much calmness to me and so much security and is always reassuring and loving and just very consistent with how he loves me and doesn’t make me question it or doubt it for a second,” she told Us Weekly last year. </p>



<p>“And loving him is just easy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>She does, you guys.</p>



<p>She really, really does.</p>



<p>On Saturday, the surprising romantic rumor because a beautiful reality for Tammy Slaton, as the 1,000-lb Sisters star got married at Windsor Lane Rehabilitation Center in Gibsonburg, Ohio.</p>



<p>The long-time TLC personality confirmed the amazing news herself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;You all knew me as Tammy Slaton, but now you&#8217;ll all know me as Mrs. Tammy Willingham,&#8221; <a href="https://people.com/health/1000-lb-sisters-tammy-slaton-weds-caleb-willingham/">Tammy told People</a> Magazine after exchanging vows.</p>



<p>She then emphasized: </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m married now!&#8221;</p>



<p>We first <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/tammy-slaton-engaged-in-rehab-planning-to-get-married-very-soon/">heard that Slaton was engaged</a> to a man named Caleb two weeks ago.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>At the time, an insider told The Sun that Tammy met her fiance inside of the aforementioned wellness center and that the two bonded over their shared history and situation.</p>



<p>“They have a lot of the same struggles that they can share,&#8221; this source explained back then, adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;They’ve been a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/tammy-slaton-engaged-in-rehab-planning-to-get-married-very-soon/">huge support for each other</a> [in rehab], which is awesome.”</p>



<p>Slaton, as readers likely know, checked herself into rehab several months ago after a life-threatening health scare forced her into a coma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>In early 2022, Tammy entered rehab. She remained there for many months, supposedly losing over 100 pounds in the process.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This wedding confirmation, however, marks the first time Slaton has mentioned her now-husband in public.</p>



<p>According to People, meanwhile, approximately 30 loved ones attended the ceremony &#8212; and, despite previous reports to the contrary, this group <em>did</em> include Tammy&#8217;s sister, Amy, who wore an orange gown for the special occasion.</p>



<p>Tammy rocked a white dress and tiara, while Caleb went with a black outfit with brown suspenders.</p>

Here they are in a promotional photo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In late October, Caleb proposed to his spouse in a video shared with The Sun, which went on to write that Caleb intends to move to Kentucky to spend more time with his wife.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear when each will check out of rehab, however.</p>



<p>We can also state for the record that Tammy and Caleb&#8217;s wedding journey will be documented in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/1000-lb-sisters-renewed-when-will-it-premiere/">new season of 1000 Lb. Sisters</a>, which premieres January 17 at 9/8c.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Who was I in my past life? That&#8217;s what Tammy Slaton asked in this photo of herself.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Slaton previously had her romantic history documented on the same program, such as last year when she broke up with former partner Philip, who her sister Amy said wanted &#8220;her to be a glutton.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tammy told me she broke up with Phil, and I&#8217;m like, about damn time,&#8221; Amy said on a Season 3 episode. </p>



<p>&#8220;Now you need to work on yourself&#8230;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m hoping with the whole breakup, it don&#8217;t deter Tammy away from her weight loss, because she needs to lose this 25 pounds. The doctor gave her a goal.&#8221;</p>

<p>We could not be happier for her!</p>



<p>Congrats to the newlyweds!</p>

<p>Christina Hall and Josh Hall just got married.</p>



<p><em><strong>Again</strong></em>.</p>



<p>The HGTV personality and her alleged soulmate <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/christina-haack-married-again-this-time-to-josh-hall/">became wife and husband in April</a>.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, however, Christina and Josh celebrated their nuptials with an intimate and romantic oceanfront ceremony in front of friends and family at Merriman&#8217;s Kapalua in Maui.</p>



<p>They each shared photos from the gathering on social media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Christina Hall and Josh Hall are all smiles in this revealing photo of the couple, which got married in April 2022.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Shared vows in front of family and our close friends,&#8221; Christina wrote in the caption of her post. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everything in life has led me to where I am right now, which is exactly where I want to be. My dream man on the dreamiest island. Maui holds a special place in my heart. </p>



<p>&#8220;What an amazing night filled with love.&#8221;</p>



<p>As mentioned above, we learned in April that the couple had gotten married in a quiet ceremony at some point in the previous six months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Josh Hall is married to Christina Haack. He&#8217;s posing here with his wife and her three kids.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Following those nuptials, Josh uploaded a supportive message on Instagram for his spouse after the couple received a handful negative comments about their union on social media.</p>



<p>A bunch of trolls out there lashed out at Christina for getting married for a third time&#8230; having previously been the wife of Flip or Flop co-star Tarek El Moussa and then television personality Ant Anstead.</p>



<p>She shares a son and a daughter with Tarek and a young son with Ant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;This woman I get to call mine is nothing short of incredible,&#8221; Josh captioned an April 13 post. </p>



<p>&#8220;No one or [nothing] will keep her from achieving happiness/success. She doesn&#8217;t need anyones validation and certainly doesn&#8217;t let anyones disapproval affect what she does with HER life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hall &#8212; who proposed to Christina in the fall of 2021 &#8212; also issued a reminder to his followers, emphasizing back then that social media is not real life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the best moments are never captured by cameras and are not posted in any social media platforms,&#8221; he added. </p>



<p>&#8220;They are kept in private and are cherished together with those involved.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Also in April 2022, Haack’s real estate license was obtained by several news outlets &#8212; and it confirmed her name has legally <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/christina-hall-blasts-ex-husband-again-this-guy-is-a-gold-digging-loser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="16">been changed to Christina Hall</a>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere this spring, the newlyweds <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/christina-haack-im-starting-a-new-tv-show-with-my-new-husband/">decided to go into business together</a>. </p>



<p>Haack announced in March that she and Hall started their own production company, Unbroken Productions.</p>



<p>“Having my own production company to produce what I want has always been a huge dream! I love that I have the most hard working / creative partner in Josh and we have this amazing team to create content with,” she wrote via Instagram. </p>



<p>“I am so grateful for this new opportunity. We can’t wait to co-produce Christina on the Coast season 4 for @hgtv as well as some brand new shows!!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>The Hawaiian wedding ceremony comes two years after Christina announced her split from Anstead.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate,&#8221; Christina wrote to her Instagram followers in September 2020. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority. We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since then, Christina and Ant have been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/ant-anstead-whoa-whoa-whoa-im-not-trying-to-take-away-christina/">involved in an ugly child custody dispute</a>.</p>

<p>They do, you guys.</p>



<p>They really, really do.</p>



<p>On Monday, Nikki Bella and Artem Chigvintsev confirmed on Instagram that they had taken full advantage of The City of Love, exchanging vows in Paris in front of a small gathering of friends and family members.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Nikki Bella and Artem Chigvintsev have a reason to be all smiles. As of August 2022, they&#8217;re husband and wife!</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We said I DO,&#8221; Bella captioned a photo of her and the Dancing with the Stars pro&#8217;s hands with their new wedding bands. </p>



<p>She also uploaded a snapshot of her and Chigvintsev embracing and taking in the Paris skyline, including the Eiffel Tower, as they toasted their new romantic status.</p>



<p>The newlyweds are prepared give fans a special look into their big day on the upcoming E! special <em>Nikki Bella Says I Do</em>. </p>



<p>The four-part series will debut early next year and it will follow the bride and groom throughout the wedding planning process &#8212; from dress shopping to venue hunting to Nikki&#8217;s bachelorette party and lots more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t wait to share the entire journey with you,&#8221; Bella also wrote today on social media, a clear reference to the upcoming program.</p>



<p>Bella and Chigvintsev met in 2017 while teamed up together on season 25 of Dancing with the Stars. </p>



<p>At the time, she was actually engaged to John Cena, but that pair called off their engagement and canceled their wedding a year later.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Bella and Chigvintsev officially started dating in 2019 &#8230; and later announced their engagement in January 2020. </p>



<p>That same month, the attractive stars announced they were expecting their first child, Matteo, whom they welcomed on July 31, 2020.</p>



<p>He arrived less than 24 hours before Bella&#8217;s twin sister, Brie, welcomed <em>her</em> second child, son Buddy Dessert, with husband Daniel Bryan.</p>



<p>Crazy, right??? And so very cool.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Speaking to People Magazine, Bella later tried to explain how it felt when she saw her now-husband holding their newborn.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that moment I had fallen so much more in love with him because to see him be so emotional holding his son, and I could just see this caretaker form, like this man that&#8217;s going to protect this little boy for the rest of his life,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just seeing the emotion in his face, it made me melt.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Nikki told E! News&#8217; Daily Pop in February that becoming a mother played a majo influenced on how she viewed marriage, saying:</p>



<p>&#8220;Once I had Matteo and I started to raise him, I was like, when I say &#8216;I do,&#8217; I want to make sure it&#8217;s forever&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know there are things that Artem wants too &#8212; like he really wants his parents there &#8212; but also, overall, I don&#8217;t want my son to go through a divorce.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sadly, this is exactly what just happened to another Dancing with the Stars couple, as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/emma-slater-and-sasha-farber-its-over-after-4-years-of-marriage/">Emma Slater and Sasha Farber announced the end of their marriage</a> last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>On Saturday, Teresa Giudice vowed to cherish and love Luis Ruelas forever and ever.</p>



<p>As detailed right here on The Hollywood Gossip, the long-time <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/teresa-giudice-marries-luis-ruelas-get-all-the-lavish-details/">reality star married her controversial boyfriend</a> in front of 220 guests in New Jersey.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though:</p>



<p>In the wake of this special occasion, many observers are focused a lot more on the individuals who were NOT in attendance&#8230; as opposed to those who cheered the couple on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>By now, you&#8217;re likely familiar with the well-known loved ones who showed up for the black tie affair.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking about such Bravo personalities as Jennifer Aydin, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs and Jackie Goldschneider.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re referring to breakout Real Housewives of Dubai cast member Chanel Ayan.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re including Alexia Nepola&#8230; Ashley Darby&#8230; Dorinda Medley&#8230; Jill Zarin&#8230; Kenya Moore&#8230; Phaedra Parks&#8230; and Cynthia Bailey.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Did you take note of those NOT cited above?</p>



<p>Giudice and Ruelas&#8217;s wedding on Saturday was ignored by the bride&#8217;s brother and sister-in-law, Joe Gorga and Melissa Gorga, due to a pretty major blowout the quartet had at the Real Housewives of New Jersey season 13 taping days prior.</p>



<p>According to People Magazine, the Gorgas decided at the last minute to snub Teresa on her big day. </p>



<p>For what reason?</p>



<p>As the aforementioned outlet writes, &#8220;false rumors&#8221; about Joe and Melissa&#8217;s marriage surfaced as the cameras rolled on upcoming episodes. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>An insider notes that &#8220;Teresa&#8217;s part in the matter and Luis&#8217;s behavior amid their back and forth ultimately changed the Gorgas&#8217; minds&#8221; when it came to RSVPing in the affirmative.</p>



<p>&#8220;Teresa betrayed them in a way that&#8217;s unforgivable,&#8221; one <a href="https://people.com/tv/melissa-gorga-joe-gorga-skipped-teresa-giudices-wedding-after-unforgivable-betrayal-sources/">source tells People</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not going to celebrate Teresa&#8217;s new marriage when all she does is try to tear apart theirs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Teresa and her brother clashed hard on the Season 12 reunion special, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/teresa-giudice-apologizes-to-brother-after-ugly-reunion-spat-i-l/">with Giudice eventually apologizing</a> over the way she blasted her sibling after she felt he wasn&#8217;t supportive enough of Ruelas and their romance.</p>

<p>In this unfortunate case, People also notes how Teresa was forced to get married in front of friends&#8230; but not family.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s telling that Teresa didn&#8217;t have one relative at her wedding,&#8221; says the publication, pointing to the absence of estranged cousins Kathy Wakile and Rosie Pierri too. </p>



<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s the choice Teresa made.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Gorgas, meanwhile, weren&#8217;t the only ones who skipped Giudice and Ruelas&#8217;s ceremony and reception. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The former inmate&#8217;s best friend Dina Manzo was also absent from the festivities.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this snub was due to a falling out between the ex-close pals, or if Manzo simply didn&#8217;t want to appear on camera.</p>



<p>She memorably quit the show way back after Season 6; and Teresa&#8217;s wedding was, indeed, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/teresa-giudice-lands-huge-wedding-special-deal-with-bravo/">filmed for a future Bravo special</a>.</p>



<p>For her part, Manzo shared a cryptic post on Instagram over the weekend about having &#8220;the courage to know when to end things.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Still, Teresa was not without the four people closest to her on her second wedding day.</p>



<p>The reality star&#8217;s four daughters &#8212; Gia, 21, Gabriella, 17, Milania, 16, and Audriana, 12, whom she shares with her ex-husband Joe Giudice &#8212; were all by their mom&#8217;s side, as were Ruelas&#8217; two sons, David and Nicholas, from his previous relationship.</p>



<p>Giudice&#8217;s wedding special is expected to air on Bravo next year, following the finale of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 13.  </p>

<p>Congratulations are very much in order for Teresa Giudice and Luis Ruelas.</p>



<p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey star exchanged vows on Saturday with her long-time boyfriend at the Park Chateau Estate &amp; Gardens in East Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>



<p>This union marks Teresa&#8217;s second marriage, as she was married to ex-husband Joe for over two decades.</p>



<p>The relationship fell apart, however, after both halves of the couple pleaded guilty to financial fraud and spent time in prison&#8230; with Joe even getting deported to Italy for breaking federal law as a non-U.S. citizen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The ceremony on August 6 was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/teresa-giudice-lands-huge-wedding-special-deal-with-bravo/">filmed for an upcoming Bravo special</a>.</p>



<p>As for the pertinent details?</p>



<p><strong>Giudice&#8217;s four daughters — Gia, 21; Gabriella, 17; Milania, 16, and Audriana, 12 &#8212; served as Teresa&#8217;s bridesmaids</strong>.</p>



<p>Luis&#8217;s two sons from his previous relationship, David and Nicholas, were also in attendance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p><strong>The event was a black tie affair.</strong></p>



<p>Very familiar names and faces who celebrated in person with Giudice and Rueles included:</p>



<p>Jennifer Aydin, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs and Jackie Goldschneider from New Jersey, plus Real Housewives of Dubai breakout Chanel Ayan.</p>



<p>There was Real Housewives of Miami&#8217;s Alexia Nepola&#8230; Real Housewives of Potomac star Ashley Darby&#8230; Real Housewives of New York City alums Dorinda Medley and Jill Zarin&#8230; and past/present Real Housewives of Atlanta stars Kenya Moore, Phaedra Parks and Cynthia Bailey.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p><strong>Guidice wore a white, mermaid-cut, strapless wedding dress with sheer gloves and a large tiara. </strong></p>



<p><strong>She and Ruelas said “I do” on Saturday night in front of a heart-shaped flower arch. </strong></p>



<p><strong>The groom donned a white jacket for the special occasion.</strong></p>



<p>There were 220 guests on hand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Teresa is on cloud nine,&#8221; an insider told E! News ahead of the big day. </p>



<p>&#8220;She wanted a fairy tale wedding and that is exactly what she is getting. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everything is being done with such precision to make this an unforgettable evening.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to People Magazine, <strong>Giudice walked down the aisle to violin players and &#8220;Ave Maria,&#8221; a song chosen to honor of her late parents</strong>. </p>



<p>Each of the couple&#8217;s children joined them in the lighting of the ceremony&#8217;s unity candles, while the ceremony was officiated by Ruelas&#8217;s sister, Dr. Veronica Ruelas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;<strong>I will love you for a million tomorrows,</strong>&#8221; Giudice told her now-husband before their kiss.</p>



<p>For food at the reception?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve heard there a multi-course menu that included &#8220;the biggest cowboy steaks&#8221; Zarin&#8217;d ever seen. </p>



<p><strong>Shake Shack, a pizza truck, and a candy truck provided tasty treats for late-night snackers</strong>. Yum!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Teresa and Luis started dating in September 2020, not long after the former finalized her divorce.</p>



<p>Giudice has often been forced to stand up against <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/luis-ruelas-accused-of-shoving-ex-wife-into-metal-pole-during-cu/">rumors surrounding Luis</a>, insisting to her co-stars and critics that he&#8217;s a good person with good intentions.</p>



<p>There was also chatter that the romance was moving too quickly.</p>



<p>In October 2021, Rules popped the major question to the reality star during a romantic trip to Greece.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;My Fiancé you are such a beautiful person inside and out,&#8221; Guidice captioned a post via Instagram at the time </p>



<p>&#8220;I love everything about you, especially your heart and the way you treat me and my daughters. </p>



<p>&#8220;You are amazing in so many ways one thing I admire about you is what a great Dad you are.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am so lucky to have found you thank you for coming into my life. I know my parents sent you to me from that day I prayed to them on Bay Blvd. I adore you endlessly. </p>



<p>&#8220;You are the love of my life, my soulmate and my everything. I Love you.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Ruelas, for his part, simply gushed about how he knew Giudice was The One from the nanosecond he laid eyes on her. </p>



<p>“I spent my entire life dreaming of you … everyday without even knowing who you were,” he wrote via Instagram alongside a photo from the engagement celebration. </p>



<p>“These have been the most defining moments of my life and I am eternally grateful to share them with you. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is just the beginning of the rest of our lives.&#8221;</p>
