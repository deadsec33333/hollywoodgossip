<p>Back in 2023, the publication of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Harry&#8217;s debut memoir </a>created quite a stir within royal circles.</p>



<p>The book, titled <em>Spare</em>, contained many surprising revelations about Harry&#8217;s childhood and early adult years.</p>



<p>But it was not as critical of the other members of the royal family as some readers had expected and &#8212; in many cases &#8212; hoped.</p>



<p>Still, it seems that Harry&#8217;s brother and sister-in-law are so offended by the very existence of the book that they refuse to give it a chance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-and-william-reportedly-refuse-to-read-harry-s-book">Kate and William reportedly refuse to read Harry&#8217;s book</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-14522965/Royal-Family-thought-hearing-Prince-Harry-memoir-called-Spare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to</a> a recent biography of King Charles by royal expert Robert Hardman, neither Will nor Kate has read Harry&#8217;s memoir.</p>



<p>And it seems that neither of them has any intention of doing so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither of them read it. He is a grown-up, 40-year-old with the BBC app on his phone so he knows what it says,&#8221; one palace insider remarked. &#8220;But he has people like me to tell him what else he needs to know. We gave him the key points.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are spearheading a new campaign called Heads Together in partnership with inspiring charities, which aims to change the national conversation on mental wellbeing." class="wp-image-522982" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-523671774-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are spearheading a new campaign called Heads Together in partnership with inspiring charities, which aims to change the national conversation on mental wellbeing.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Nicky J Sims/Getty Images for Royal Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the book may not have proved as damaging as some royals feared, it still generated a good deal of controversy at a very vulnerable time for the royals (it hit stores just months after the death of Queen Elizabeth II).</p>



<p>Hardman says the royals cryptically referred to bad press from overseas as &#8220;headwinds that we face from across the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was one way of describing an extraordinary 12-week run of non-stop disobliging headlines and combative allegations, all of them entirely beyond the control of the King and his staff. Storm-force gales might have been a better metaphor,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weathering-the-storm">Weathering the storm </h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="685" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1060279056-4-1024x685.jpg" alt="Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend a service marking the centenary of WW1 armistice at Westminster Abbey on November 11, 2018 in London, England.

<p>Hardman added that despite the challenges presented by the book&#8217;s publication, the lasting impact was negligible.</p>



<p>&#8220;That this should all be unfolding in the first phase of a new reign might once have been considered disastrous. However, there were two unexpected aspects to these ‘headwinds’ which would work in Charles III’s favour,&#8221; he explained, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;First, the constant diet of extraneous negativity, though awkward and at times embarrassing, made very little impact, according to polls, on public attitudes towards the monarchy. Second, it appeared to have no discernible impact on the King himself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, there are still concerns about Harry&#8217;s literary career, due mainly to the fact that &#8220;large chunks of more recent events&#8221; were left out of Spare.</p>



<p>&#8220;This suggested either a sequel or, perhaps, a memoir by Meghan in due course,&#8221; Hardman wrote.</p>



<p>There has been talk of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/meghan-markle-tell-all-memoir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan writing a memoir</a> of her own. But considering <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/prince-harry-hates-america-and-should-self-deport-conservative-group-argues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry&#8217;s book almost got him deported</a>, we&#8217;re guessing he&#8217;s content to focus on other pursuits for a while.</p>

<p>Kate Middleton has shared a new message in honor of Mother&#8217;s Day in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>The parent of three &#8212; who shares Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6, with Prince William &#8212; marked this occasion on March 30 with a touching tribute to Mother Nature.</p>



<p>In doing so, she also acknowledged the journey she has been on for the past many months.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="915" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-1024x915.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522428" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-1024x915.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-300x268.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-768x686.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-2048x1830.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-960x858.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-1080x965.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205559725-1200x1072.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Middleton during the 2025 Irish Guards&#8217; St. Patrick&#8217;s Day Parade at Wellington Barracks on March 17, 2025 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Over the past year, nature has been our sanctuary,&#8221; Princess Kate captioned her Instagram post, which featured a video comprised various outdoor scenes.</p>



<p>This is a clear reference to Middleton having battled some form of cancer since around this same time in 2024.</p>



<p>Thankfully, as we learned in January, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-says-shes-in-remission-from-cancer-one-year-after-starting-treatment/">Royal Beauty is now in remission</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;This Mother’s Day, let us celebrate Mother Nature and recognize how our bond with the natural world can help not only nurture our inner selves, but remind us too of the role we play within the rich tapestry of life,&#8221; Middleton continued, concluding the post with her first initial, <em>C</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521743" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William and Kate Middleton meet injured players who are supported by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust as they attend the Six Nations match between Wales and England at the Principality Stadium on March 15, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Alastair Grant-WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the social media montage, Middleton donning a patterned beige dress and touching a tree as the sunlight surrounds her. </p>



<p>In another moment caught on camera, someone who appears to be her husband, walks through tall grass with their dogs at his heels. </p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s kids are not included, out of respect for their privacy we&#8217;re assuming.</p>



<p>This latest The tribute to nature comes after Kate’s controversial 2024 Mother’s Day post, which she later confessed to altering after keen observers noticed some strange details.</p>

<p>Back then, the beloved princess shared a snapshot of herself sitting and smiling next to her three children. </p>



<p>As the picture made its way around the internet, many observers noticed some oddities &#8212; including Charlotte and Louis appearing blurry, Kate’s zipper looking edited and her hair seemingly being airbrushed.</p>



<p>“Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,” Middleton subsequently wrote to explain what transpired. </p>



<p>“I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused.</p>



<p>The statement did little to shut down the speculation that the Royal Family was hiding something&#8230; especially because Middleton had undergone abdominal surgery in January 2024 and had retreated from the public eye during her recovery. </p>



<p>At the time, she wasn’t scheduled to attend any public events until after Easter.</p>



<p>Kate was then forced to tell the world about her cancer diagnosis <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-cancer-treatment-complete-video/">and eventual treatment</a>.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since.</p>



<p>Middleton has recently been seen out and about, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kate-middleton-drinks-guinness-makes-post-cancer-return-to-st-patricks-day-festivities/">even drinking beer</a>.</p>



<p>We continue to send Kate and her loved ones nothing but the best.</p>

<p>Kate Middleton and Prince William have been going through <em><strong>it</strong></em> for awhile now.</p>



<p>There was Meghan Markle and Prince Harry defecting out of the family and the country&#8230; there was the COVID-19 pandemic&#8230; and most recently, of course, there was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-cancer-health-update/">Middleton&#8217;s cancer diagnosis</a> in early 2024.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that Prince Charles has also been diagnosed with this awful disease.</p>



<p>Such tumultuous events would be enough to tear nearly any couple apart, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521743" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204691287-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William and Kate Middleton meet injured players who are supported by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust as they attend the Six Nations match between Wales and England at the Principality Stadium on March 15, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Alastair Grant-WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This hasn&#8217;t been the case for Middleton and William, however, according to Royal historian Amanda Foreman.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is a sense of protectiveness and partnership,&#8221; Foreman says in the <a href="https://people.com/kate-middleton-prince-william-nightmare-5-years-exclusive-11699262">latest issue of People Magazine</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The last five years have been a nightmare for them in every possible way &#8212; the past year even more so. That either crushes a marriage, or it brings them together.&#8221;</p>



<p>Foreman emphasizes that the spouses are closer than ever these days, which is especially important because &#8220;the international stage is so unstable.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="692" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-692x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-521747" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-692x1024.jpg 692w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-203x300.jpg 203w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-768x1137.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-1384x2048.jpg 1384w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-649x960.jpg 649w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-730x1080.jpg 730w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-811x1200.jpg 811w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2204395784-scaled.jpg 1730w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kate Middleton and Prince William depart the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March 10, 2025 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> ((Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither Kate nor William has said a ton in public about their relationship or the trials that have tested it of late.</p>



<p>But Middleton has completed her cancer treatments. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kate-middleton-drinks-guinness-makes-post-cancer-return-to-st-patricks-day-festivities/">She&#8217;s out there drinking beer</a>. We can all pray that the worst is behind them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult,” William said in November to reporters. </p>



<p>“I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done. But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.”</p>

<p>Middleton returned to her Royal duties after announcing in January that her cancer was in remission. </p>



<p>Prince William and his wife have remained mostly tight-lipped about their estranged relationship with Harry and Markle, choosing instead to focus on their own romance.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen more of the pair <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-go-full-on-pda-in-rare-valentines-day-photo/">acting all cute and cuddly</a> in public then ever before.</p>



<p>As you might expect these days, Kate and William are primarily focused on their children: Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6.</p>

<p>One year after Kate revealed to the world that she was sick, royal biographer Robert Hardman tells People: “There is definitely a feeling of resetting the dial &#8212; of being back.”</p>



<p>Adds Ailsa Anderson, a former press secretary to Queen Elizabeth: </p>



<p>“Fast-forward, and what a difference a year makes. She’s even more beloved in the nation’s hearts than she was.”</p>

<p>If anyone has earned a drink over the past several months or so, it would be Kate Middleton.</p>



<p>And the Princess of Wales went right ahead and took a well-deserved swig on Monday morning.</p>



<p>In honor of St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, Middleton was spotted today &#8212; decked out in bottle-green and wearing a percher hat &#8212; presenting the traditional sprigs of shamrock to officers, guardsmen and wolfhound mascot Seamus at the regiment&#8217;s annual parade at Wellington Barracks.</p>

<p>It was refreshing to see Middleton out and about in the wake of her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-opens-up-about-chemo-port-implant-i-grew-attached-to-it/">cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment</a>, but it made us smile even broader when we learned that the Royal beauty later joined soldiers for a drink.</p>



<p>Middleton reportedly took a few sips of Irish beer Guinness and was thanked for putting money behind the bar, replying &#8220;that&#8217;s the least I can do.&#8221;</p>



<p>The princess, who has been colonel of the regiment since 2023, missed these same festivities last year after learning she was sick.</p>



<p>Prior to the parade, meanwhile, Middleton awarded medals for long service and good conduct to soldiers who recently returned from deployment in Iraq.</p>

<p>Five days after this parade in 2024, Middleton shared a video in which she told the world that she had cancer.</p>



<p>Fast forward all this time later and Royal commentator Jennie Bond telling The Mirror that the future Queen “will attend as many of the big events as she feels able.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-says-shes-in-remission-from-cancer-one-year-after-starting-treatment/">she&#8217;s in remission</a>, this should hopefully mean many more sightings of Middleton as the days, weeks and months go on.</p>



<p>“As the anniversary of the video’s release approaches, Catherine will no doubt be reflecting on how far she has come since then and how much love and admiration from around the world has come her way,” Bond also said to The Mirror. </p>



<p>“With the weather turning warmer and the day of her diagnosis becoming more distant, she appears to have a real spring in her step and joy in her heart to be alive and able to pick up some of the threads of her public life.”</p>

<p>We absolutely love to hear that.</p>



<p>Per The BBC, a guardsman named Barry Loughlin spoke to Middleton after she downed her half a pint of Guinness.</p>



<p>&#8220;She wanted to know how things were going with the blokes in general,&#8221; he told this outlet. &#8220;She was really nice and really warm. I was kind of flustered. You could tell she had a genuine interest in us.&#8221;</p>

<p>On September 9, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-cancer-treatment-complete-video/">Middleton confirmed she had completed</a> chemotherapy.</p>



<p>“The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family,” she said in a statement, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Life as you know it can change in an instant and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown. The cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you.”</p>



<p>The message was accompanied by a video montage feature Kate with her husband and kids.</p>



<p>She added she is “looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months when I can.”<br></p>

<p>Generally, when Piers Morgan comments on royal matters, he takes the side of King Charles, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/prince-william/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince William</a>, and Kate Middleton.</p>



<p>So it came as a surprise when Morgan discussed <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/john-oliver-thinks-kate-middleton-might-be-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate&#8217;s absence</a> from royal life and shared his belief that palace officials were hiding something.</p>



<p>Addressing the matter on his talk show <em>Uncensored</em> last year, Morgan revealed that he had heard “alarming things&#8221; about the Princess of Wales.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1825444049-1024x683.jpg" alt="Catherine, Princess Of Wales is seen during the opening of Evelina London's new children's day surgery unit on December 5, 2023 in London, England.

<p>He also criticized the palace&#8217;s attempts to undermine widespread conspiracy theories via misleading comments and doctored photos.</p>



<p>In a moment that was shockingly out of step with his usual stance on the royals, Morgan admitted that the king and company “got it wrong,&#8221; adding that “the palace could be hiding something.&#8221;</p>



<p>This was before we knew that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/prince-william-kate-middleton-cancer-battle-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate was battling cancer</a> and had stepped away from the spotlight in order to undergo treatment.</p>



<p>When we learned of her condition, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/piers-morgan-kate-middleton-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piers demanded that Kate disclose every detail</a>. Thankfully, she has insisted on her right to privacy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-officially-returns-to-work-following-cancer-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate has since returned</a> to full-time royal duty. But Piers has yet to apologize for speculating wildly and propagating conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve been told some stuff that, if even half of it is true, it’s pretty alarming what is happening,&#8221; Morgan told his audience (via <em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/piers-morgan-kate-middleton-royal-family-b2514240.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Independent</a></em>) in March 2024, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t know what to believe, nor do any of us &#8212; we’re not there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Morgan tempered his comments at the time with a reminder that no one outside of the royal family really knew what was going on with Kate.</p>



<p>A week after his remarks, however, the world was clued in by the Princess herself that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-cancer-health-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battling cancer</a>. </p>



<p>Before her announcement, Morgan expressed similar concerns in his column for the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/11/opinion/kate-middletons-fake-photo-fiasco-proves-the-secretive-royals-must-come-clean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a></em>, arguing that the royals&#8217; culture of silence has no place in the age of information.</p>



<p>“The mantra of Britain’s greatest monarch, the late, great Queen Elizabeth II, was very simple: Never complain, never explain, and rarely be heard speaking in public,&#8221; Morgan wrote.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-piers-morgan-on-the-conspiracy-theories">Piers Morgan On The Conspiracy Theories</h2>



<p>He went on to criticize the royals for releasing the now infamous <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/kate-middleton-family-portrait-removed-by-news-agencies-due-to-alleged-editing-wth-is-going-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edited photo of Kate</a> in an effort to suppress the rising tide of rumors.</p>



<p>“But the conspiracy theories about Kate Middleton’s secret health crisis and disappearance from public life, made worse by the manipulated family photo she posted yesterday, when added to the unsettling confusion over what cancer King Charles is suffering from and how serious his condition is, have shown that the old palace way of handling the media has become increasingly obsolete and unworkable,&#8221; Morgan wrote, adding:</p>



<p>“I feel very sorry for Kate that she’s had to go through whatever health issue she’s had, which has kept her away from public gaze, and duty, for so long.&#8221;</p>



<p>Morgan concluded with the following word of caution:</p>

<p>“But my sympathy will erode if it turns out that she and the palace have deliberately misled the media and public about when the photo was taken to convey a false impression about her condition.”</p>

<p>Kate Middleton doesn&#8217;t want her children to end up like Prince Harry.</p>



<p>Prince Harry has many good qualities. He is charitable, kind-hearted, has a strong sense of duty, and puts <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-corrects-mindy-kaling-on-how-to-address-her-during-awkward-with-love-meghan-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his wife</a> and children before all else.</p>



<p>But, in one respect, Kate doesn&#8217;t want George, or especially Charlotte or Louis, to be like their uncle.</p>



<p>To that end, a new report claims, Kate is working to make certain that they do not walk in Harry&#8217;s footsteps.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-lessons-has-kate-middleton-learned-from-what-happened-to-prince-harry">What lessons has Kate Middleton learned from what happened to Prince Harry?</h2>



<p>According to a new report by <em><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/kate-middleton-mission-stop-boys-turning-out-like-royal-exile-prince-harry-doesnt-want-history-repeating-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a></em>, Kate Middleton is using her background as a wealthy commoner now that she&#8217;s a royal parent.</p>



<p>Kate married into royalty. Her hope is that her own experiences will allow her to safeguard her children from walking down Prince Harry&#8217;s path.</p>



<p>Prince George is 11. Princess Charlotte is 9. Prince Louis is 7. Kate hopes that all three will grow up with a strong sense of duty, just like Harry. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="710" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1024x710.jpg" alt="Prince Harry on February 16, 2025." class="wp-image-520638" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-300x208.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-768x532.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-2048x1420.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-960x665.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1080x749.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_princeharry_01-1200x832.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, Founder and Patron of the Invictus Games Foundation delivers remarks at the Closing Ceremonies of the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 on February 16, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images for Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, the report says that she hopes that they will not grow up under the burden of the traditional constraints that come with the monarchy.</p>



<p>Setting that boundary would be much more of a challenge for Prince William. He has only ever known royal life &#8212; and the expectation that he will someday become king <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/king-charles-accused-of-creating-toxic-work-environment-amid-cancer-battle-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like his father</a>.</p>



<p>Though Kate grew up in a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/kate-middleton-parents-net-worth-family-business-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealthy family</a>, they were still not part of the anachronistic institution into which she has married. That can make a tremendous difference when it comes to raising three royal children to </p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/prince-harry-memoir-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bestselling memoir, <em>Spare</em></a>, Prince Harry writes about feeling like a backup heir to his brother &#8212; and Kate Middleton clearly knows that.</p>



<p>According to the report&#8217;s inside source: &#8220;Although the royal couple embraces tradition, they aren&#8217;t afraid to adapt and step away from strict protocols when the situation calls for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider continued: &#8220;William and Kate are dedicated to their children and prioritize family above all else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their approach highlights what’s truly important,&#8221; the source alleged. </p>



<p>The insider continued: &#8220;Giving the kids the freedom to explore their interests and have a childhood that feels as normal as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>The source then noted: &#8220;A key part of Kate&#8217;s parenting philosophy is ensuring that Prince George, despite being the heir, doesn’t overshadow his siblings.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-report-leaves-something-out">That report leaves something out</h2>



<p>One of the biggest issues for Prince Harry came in adulthood, when he had his own wife and child. </p>



<p>British tabloids penned numerous hate pieces against Meghan Markle (as they continue to do), while he felt like the royal firm offered her up without extending the sorts of pressures and protections that William and Kate received.</p>



<p>We of course cannot verify if any part of <em>RadarOnline</em>&#8216;s report is true. But we hope that William and Kate will ensure that their own children&#8217;s spouses do not become such easy targets.</p>

<p>Kate Middleton is making a long overdue change in royal tradition.</p>



<p>Her husband, her brother-in-law, and her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/prince-william-kate-middleton-preparing-for-death-of-failing-king-charles-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">father-in-law</a> all participated in &#8220;blooding&#8221; in their youth.</p>



<p>This barbaric practice will not, she has reportedly insisted, pass on to her own royal children.</p>



<p>Updates can be a very good thing. Especially for ancient, crumbling institutions.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="769" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-1024x769.jpg" alt="Kate Middleton on February 11, 2025." class="wp-image-520388" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-768x577.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-2048x1537.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-728x546.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-480x360.jpg 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-320x240.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-960x721.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-1080x811.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_01-1200x901.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Catherine, Princess Of Wales visits an &#8216;Action For Children&#8217; mother and baby unit at HMP Styal, a prison and young offender institution, near Wilmslow on February 11, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Phil Noble-WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-blooding-for-kate-middleton-or-her-children-thank-you-very-much">No &#8216;blooding&#8217; for Kate Middleton or her children, thank you very much</h2>



<p>The United Kingdom is home to many traditions. Some are very silly &#8212; like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/there-she-is-kate-middleton-makes-first-formal-appearance-in-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trooping The Colour</a>, not installing window screens, and eating beans on toast.</p>



<p>Others, however, are nothing short of barbaric rites that look wouldn&#8217;t look out of place in a horror film.</p>



<p>One of those is called &#8220;blooding.&#8221; This bizarre royal ritual calls upon the royal family to hunt foxes and deer and to smear the fresh blood from their kill upon their faces. Gross!</p>

<p>According to an excerpt from royal author Tom Quinn&#8217;s <em>Yes Ma&#8217;am &#8211; The Secret Life of Royal Servant</em>s that appears in <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14397971/kate-middleton-ritual-tradition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>, Kate Middleton isn&#8217;t having it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/kate-middleton-clashing-with-prince-william-over-plans-for-prince-george-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince George</a> is 11 years old. Princess Charlotte is 9 years old. Prince Louis is 6 years old.</p>



<p>As far as the Princess of Wales is concerned, none of her children are going to be smearing their faces with the blood of animal corpses. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kate-middleton-brings-a-more-modern-approach-to-the-royal-family">Kate Middleton brings a more &#8216;modern&#8217; approach to the royal family</h2>



<p>&#8220;Charles&#8217; daughter-in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, has put her foot down and insisted there will be no blooding for her children,&#8221; Quinn reportedly wrote in his book.</p>



<p>According to the author: &#8220;The king himself had gone through the rite as a child, as did his two sons, Princes William and Harry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kate Middleton is adamant that her own children not participate in this gruesome &#8220;ancient ritual.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kate Middleton and her husband, William, on February 26, 2025." class="wp-image-520391" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0228_katemiddleton_04-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales visit Meadow Street Community Garden and Woodland on February 26, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jaimi Joy &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another apparent expert on the British Royal family, <a href="https://hilaryfordwich.strelmark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hilary Fordwich</a>, echoes the sentiment that Kate Middleton brings a breath of fresh air to some stagnant royal habits.</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Catherine, coming from a middle-class family, wasn’t brought up with the same royal traditions,&#8221; Fordwich noted. </p>



<p>Fordwich added: &#8220;To date, she is seen by both Prince William and King Charles III as an excellent mother with great instincts.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-updates-to-the-royal-family-are-good-and-healthy-right">Updates to the royal family are good and healthy, right?</h2>



<p>Traditions that are unyielding to change end up dooming themselves. While the existence of royalty is a comical anachronism that is wildly out of place in 2025, the updates are still a good idea.</p>



<p>Of course, we cannot help but recall nearly a decade ago, when British tabloids swiped <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/meghan-markle-challenges-kate-middleton-my-marriage-is-hotter-than-yours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Meghan Markle</a> over Harry reportedly not participating in fox hunts. In that case, these scathing hit pieces presented her opposition to senseless barbarity as being somehow bad.</p>



<p>Now that Kate Middleton is reportedly doing it, everyone&#8217;s on board. Is it any wonder why Harry and Meghan relocated?</p>

<p>Who says Valentine&#8217;s Day is nothing but a Hallmark holiday?!?</p>



<p>On Friday, February 14, Kate Middleton and Prince William marked the very special day in a rare move&#8230; by posting a photo of themselves sharing a public display of affection on social media.</p>

<p>The snapshot included a caption with no words; just single red love heart emoji. </p>



<p>It was initially released by the famous spouses in September 2024 as part of an emotional video announcing that Middleton had <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/kate-middleton-cancer-treatment-complete-video/">completed her chemotherapy treatment</a> following her cancer diagnosis earlier in the year.</p>



<p>As you can see above, the sweet image features the husband and wife holding hands as William kisses his bride on the cheek and she laughs. </p>



<p>It looks to have been captured in a wooded area, with the Prince and Princess sitting on a brown picnic blanket.</p>



<p>We really don&#8217;t see them very often in this sort of state, do we? Candid, dressed down, acting as if there&#8217;s no one else around?</p>

<p>Middleton, of course, announced her cancer diagnosis just about a year ago, stepping away from the spotlight for a number of months afterward.</p>



<p>The mother of three has slowly been returning to her duties and into the public sphere over the past several weeks, but it will likely be a long time until she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-will-not-be-returning-to-full-royal-duties-anytime-soon-amid-cancer-recovery-report/">back to a full-time schedule</a>.</p>



<p>She may never be.</p>



<p>This illness can take its toll on one&#8217;s body and Kate does still have three young children at home.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="706" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-1024x706.jpg" alt="Prince William and Kate Middleton and their children at trooping the colour in June 2024." class="wp-image-512279" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-1024x706.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-300x207.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-768x529.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-2048x1412.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-960x662.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-1080x745.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/1030_katemiddleton_04-1200x827.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince George of Wales, Prince William, Prince of Wales, Prince Louis of Wales, Princess Charlotte of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales during Trooping the Colour at Buckingham Palace on June 15, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In general, perhaps due to this major health scare, Kate and William have become more prominent with their public displays of affection. </p>



<p>In a June 2024 social media post for William’s birthday, as an example, Middleton wrote, &#8220;We all love you so much!&#8221; </p>



<p>The Prince of Wales then reciprocated last month with a personal birthday message to Kate in honor of her t<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-turns-43-amid-cancer-recovery-unveils-new-portrait/">urning 43 years old</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;To the most incredible wife and mother. The strength you’ve shown over the last year has been remarkable. George, Charlotte, Louis and I are so proud of you… We love you,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>Incredibly, the couple has now been together for more than 20 years overall.</p>



<p>They dated for eight years and then got married in 2011. Looks like the romance is going stronger than ever, too!</p>

<p>Welp. </p>



<p>At least we aren&#8217;t talking about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/kate-middleton-books-first-major-visit-since-completing-cancer-treatment/">Kate Middleton having cancer</a> at the moment, we suppose.</p>



<p>Instead, however, the latest controversy centered around the beautiful princess has to do with the fashion choices she makes&#8230; and whether the public is privy to information about them.</p>



<p>Yup. This is a weird one&#8230;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519031" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-80x80.jpg 80w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-728x728.jpg 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-960x960.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-1080x1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298-1200x1200.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197103298.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Catherine, Princess of Wales joins a group of four and five-year-old school children at The National Portrait Gallery on February 4, 2025 in London, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Arthur Edwards &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Back on February, the 1 Sunday Times published an article titled &#8220;Princess of Wales: Focus on my work, not my wardrobe,&#8221; which quoted a Royal source stating that the Princess of Wales “wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting.”</p>



<p>This prompted many to wonder whether or not Middleton really is sick of folks wondering about the clothes she wears.</p>



<p>Fast forward to February 11 and a Kensington Palace spokesperson releasing the following statement to People Magazine: </p>



<p>“Over the last week, I have received numerous questions about a story regarding The Princess of Wales’s clothing and how Kensington Palace shares information about her outfits.</p>



<p>“To clarify, the comments that appeared in the article were from me, not The Princess of Wales. The comments that were reported should not be directly attributed to The Princess of Wales. To be clear, there has been no change in our approach to sharing information about Her Royal Highness’s clothing.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-519032" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198337665-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Catherine, Princess Of Wales visits an &#8216;Action For Children&#8217; mother and baby unit at HMP Styal, a prison and young offender institution, near Wilmslow on February 11, 2025 in Wilmslow, England. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Phil Noble-WPA Pool/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The aforementioned Sunday Times report promoted a great deal of backlash.</p>



<p>Many in the United Kingdom, you see, believe Kate’s style plays a vital role in society by shining a spotlight on British designers and therefore boosting the British fashion industry. </p>



<p>These same critics think Middleton&#8217;s fashion decisions help connect her to the public and should never be minimized.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Kate Middleton on December 8, 2024." class="wp-image-514819" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1209_katemiddleton_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Catherine Princess of Wales attends the &#8216;Together At Christmas&#8217; Carol Service at Westminster Abbey on December 06, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Chris Jackson/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>For years, the Kensington Palace has maintained a policy of only occasionally disclosing details about what Middleton is wearing. </p>



<p>As a result, online sleuths &#8212; most notably the great website <a href="https://whatkatewore.com/">What Kate Wore</a> &#8212; have taken on the mission of tracking down this star&#8217;s outfits and sharing where to find similar pieces.</p>



<p>The full section from The Sunday Times article, which caused such an uproar and which the Palace claims never quoted Middleton in any way, read: </p>



<p>“There is an absolute feeling that [the public work] is not about what the princess is wearing.</p>



<p>&#8220;She wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting,&#8221; the story continued. &#8220;There will always be an appreciation of what the princess is wearing from some of the public and she gets that. </p>



<p>&#8220;But do we need to be officially always saying what she is wearing? No. The style is there but it’s about the substance.”</p>

<p>A new book by journalist and royal expert Tom Quinn contains a number of shocking allegations about the royal family.</p>



<p>But in their usual fashion, the British tabloid press has opted to overlook <em>most</em> of the criticism in order to focus solely on the negative claims about Meghan Markle.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the latest in a long line of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meghan-markle-suffers-another-career-setback-as-prince-harry-plots-return-to-uk-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PR crises for Meghan and Prince Harry</a>, as the book perpetuates longstanding rumors about the duchess&#8217; vanity and sense of entitlement.</p>

<p>The book, <em>Yes Ma’am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants</em>, won&#8217;t be published Stateside until February 25.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s already making waves thanks to a lengthy excerpt published in <em><a href="https://archive.is/9EZV4#selection-1883.0-1883.250">The Times of London</a></em> on Thursday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-alleged-messiah-complex">Meghan&#8217;s Alleged &#8216;Messiah Complex&#8217;</h2>



<p>“Meghan really did have a messiah complex… all her big ideas were about doing good,&#8221; Quinn quotes one royal staffer as saying.</p>



<p>&#8220;She once said, ‘What Diana started, I want to finish,’ and we took that to mean she wanted to become a sort of globetrotting champion of the poor and the marginalized. She has managed to do this to some extent, but she really wanted to do it as a princess and with the full backing of the royal family, but on a part-time basis.”</p>

<p>According to Quinn, the men and women who worked in the royal palaces during Meghan&#8217;s time in London were left with the impression that she was disappointed by the lack of opulence in the royals&#8217; lives.</p>



<p>“She expected a billionaire and she got a millionaire,&#8221; said one employee.</p>



<p>But while the staff might have been wary of Meghan from the start, it seems the royals initially got along with the former <em>Suits</em> star.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s easy to forget that when Harry first started dating Meghan, both William and Kate found her delightful,&#8221; Quinn writes. “&#8217;They thought she was a breath of fresh air,&#8217; one staffer remembered.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meghan-s-tactile-manner-offends-royals">Meghan&#8217;s &#8216;Tactile Manner&#8217; Offends Royals</h2>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kate-middleton-ends-feud-with-meghan-markle-prince-harry/">Meghan and her new in-laws</a> began to clash in unexpected ways. One surprising issue was Meghan&#8217;s tendency to express her affection physically.</p>



<p>&#8220;This tactile manner made William uncomfortable because Meghan hugged him virtually every time they bumped into each other; the hugging and cheek-kissing fuelled gossip among the staff that Meghan was flirting with William, which she was obviously not,&#8221; Quinn writes.</p>



<p>The author portrays William as a fussy product of the old school &#8212; very much his father&#8217;s son &#8212; and it seems that Meghan used to joke about her brother-in-law&#8217;s similarity to King Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why do William and Charles sound so serious all the time?&#8217; She used to make jokes about Harry not having the same parents as William,&#8221; Quinn writes. &#8220;&#8216;Harry isn’t pompous at all. He’s chill,'&#8221; one staffer remembered Meghan saying.</p>



<p>According to Quinn, Meghan felt “slightly looked down on&#8221; in her new home. That&#8217;s not surprising, especially as the staff allegedly christened her with a slew of insulting nicknames, &#8220;Duchess Difficult” and “Mystic Meg,&#8221; the latter referring to her SoCal spirituality.</p>



<p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/meghan-markle-prince-harry-to-step-away-from-spotlight-stop-bashing-royals-following-recent-backlash-source-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan and Harry stepped down as working royals</a>, and they now enjoy a much less constrained existence in Santa Barbara.</p>



<p>But as the latest drama out of London reminds us, the Duchess of Sussex might never be able to escape her in-laws entirely.</p>
