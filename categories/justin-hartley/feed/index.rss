<p>Fans are doing a double take when seeing Justin Hartley and Glen Powell and many are wondering if they&#8217;re actually related.</p>



<p>The pair look awfully familiar and have even joked in interviews how often they&#8217;re confused for the other. </p>



<p>So, is there a bloodline between these two?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s discuss.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-are-justin-and-glen">Who Are Justin and Glen?</h2>



<p>First, meet Justin Hartley.

<p>He was rumored to have gotten cozy with his co-star, <em>Euphoria</em> star Sydney Sweeney, but that wasn&#8217;t confirmed. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-justin-harley-amp-glen-powell-related">Are Justin Harley &amp; Glen Powell Related?</h2>



<p>No, they&#8217;re not &#8211; the story about how the rumor started is HILARIOUS! </p>



<p>During the Golden Globes in 2024, a photo from the red carpet went viral of Glen.</p>

<p>The photo was of a handsome blonde man in a tan tuxedo &#8211; that was not Glen at all.</p>



<p>It was of&nbsp;Justin Hartley, who preparing to present the award for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or a Motion Picture Made for Television.</p>



<p>An honest mistake, that just happened to blow up the Internet!</p>



<p>Since then, the pair have been cornered about it time and time again. </p>



<p>And Glen was quick to make the most out of the moment!</p>



<p>He took to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/glenpowell/status/1744149243810701553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> at once, posting: </p>



<p>&#8220;I think this is the perfect time to announce that ⁦@justinhartley⁩ and I will be starring in the most boring body-swap movie of all time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Boring? Perhaps &#8211; but it would be fun to watch you guys work! Is there a role for Glen on Tracker, Justin?</p>



<p>How about <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/top-gun-3-yup-its-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next <em>Top Gun</em></a>, Glen?</p>



<p>Justin Harley and Glen Powell related? No.</p>



<p>Justin Harley and Glen Powell working together? That would be a big yes from us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Justin Hartley stars on the smash NBC hit drama This Is Us.</p>
<p>But when he introduces people going forward to&nbsp;Sofia Pernas, he can now say:</p>
<p>This is <em>her</em>, the woman with whom I want to spend the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Yup,&nbsp;Sofia Pernas and Justin Hartley are married!</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>A day after the couple made its red carpet debut at the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards, multiple reliable outlets have confirmed they&#8217;re actuallly husband and wife.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about such celebrity gossip mainstays at E! News, People Magazine and TMZ.</p>
<p>Neither Pernas nor Hartley has confirmed this romantic bombshell, but each did appear to be wearing a wedding ring on Sunday at the aforementioned event.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speculation over the couple possibly having tied the knot heated up in early May, when the pair were spotted on the beach in Malibu&#8230; both rocking these same apparently wearing bands on their left hand.</p>
<p>Photos obtained by Page Six started circulatiing around the Internet back then.</p>
<p>The newlyweds, who starred in The Young and the Restless together from 2015 to 2016, initially sparked dating rumors just over a year ago.</p>
<p>From there, they went Instagram official for New Year&#8217;s Eve, with Justin sharing a black-and-white selfie along with the caption:</p>
<p>&quot;Last minutes of 2020 here in LA. Bring on 2021! Happy New Year!&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In January of this year, the actress wished her extremely handsome boyfriend a happy 44th birthday with a post that garnered a sweet remark from his daughter, 16-year-old Isabella Hartley.</p>
<p>As Sofia put it:</p>
<p>&quot;Celebrating this man with my fav screen grab. That smile!!! Lights up my sky. Happy Birthday.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the first marriage for the Spanish-Moroccan-American actress.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>For Hartley, though, it&#8217;s his third walk down the aisle.</p>
<p>Hartley was previously married to Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause for two years before <a href="/2020/08/why-did-chrishell-stause-and-justin-hartley-divorce/">he filed for divorce in November 2019</a>, allegedly alerting his then-spouse via text message that he wanted to split for good.</p>
<p>The couple&#8217;s drama also played out for all to see on Season 3 of this Netflix reality show.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m just kind of in shock with it all,&quot; she said on air during an episode, referencing Hartley&#8217;s text.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Added the reality star:</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m trying to keep it together, but it&rsquo;s just a lot all at once &#8217;cause everybody in the whole world knows at the same time that I knew.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever been knocked over by a wave and you don&rsquo;t know which way to swim to get up?</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think anyone ever gets married thinking that they&rsquo;ll get a divorce. I&rsquo;m definitely a hopeless romantic, and I feel stupid even saying that out loud.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The former couple&#8217;s divorce was finalized in February &#8212; and <a href="/2020/08/justin-hartley-to-chrishell-stause-how-dare-you-spill-our-secret/">Hartley was reportedly pissed that Stause</a> openly dragged him and discussed their failed relationship on a TV show.</p>
<p>Prio to Stause, Hartley was married to his Passions costar Lindsay Korman from 2004 to 2012.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s the mother to his teenage daughter.</p>

<p>But their romance has fallen under scrutiny as <a href="/videos/justin-hartley-texted-chrishell-stause-that-he-was-divorcing-her/">Chrishell Stause&#8217;s divorce drama</a> goes public.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/chrishell-stause-hurt-by-justin-hartley-and-sofia-pernas-dating-news/"><em>In Touch Weekly</em></a>, finding out that Justin Hartley got with Sofia Pernas was not easy for Chrishell.</p>
<p>An insider tells the tabloid that she &ldquo;felt stabbed in the heart&rdquo; at the news.</p>
<p>When she &ldquo;found out for sure&rdquo; that the two actors were &ldquo;hooking up,&rdquo; it broke her heart, the source adds.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Justin twisted the knife even deeper by making their relationship Instagram official,&rdquo; the insider characterizes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had her suspicions that something was going on between Justin and Sofia before they went public,&quot; the source adds.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; the insider says, Chrishell &quot;is still trying to put the pieces together and figure out the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Notably, Justin and Sofia &#8212; who co-starred years ago on <em>The Young And The Restless</em> &#8212; were spotted together back in May.</p>
<p>This was six months after Justin separated from Chrishell, filing for divorce and notifying her of the filing via text.</p>
<p>Later, Justin and Sofia went softly Instagram official &#8212; not posting a selfie, but just sharing photos from the same outing so that followers could connect the dots.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Chrishell has been entertainingly honest about her struggle to keep it classy on social media.</p>
<p>She has, however, &quot;liked&quot; a number of tweets related to her divorce.</p>
<p>While some were just jokes in her defense, one happened to be a tweet theorizing that Justin had cheated.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;@Justinhartley filmed a movie in Canada at the same time his new girlfriend @SofiaPernas was filming the summer before they split,&quot; a tweet reads.</p>
<p>The tweet continues: &quot;The timing seems like he probably cheated on @Chrishell7 and took a coward&rsquo;s way out to avoid spousal support and gaslight her.&quot;</p>
<p>While that&#8217;s not what <em>gaslighting </em>means, we should note that Chrishell &quot;liked&quot; that tweet.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>First of all, we have to emphasize that there is no evidence that Justin cheated on Chrishell at all, let alone with Sofia.</p>
<p>Though the two have filmed in Canada, they did work together years ago. Sometimes, the newly divorced connect with hot, single friends.</p>
<p>And even if Justin did cheat, that would not in any way be Sofia&#8217;s fault.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Chrishell herself has asked her fans and supporters to please, please tone down the vitriol.</p>
<p>Though she does not name any names, it seems that someone &#8212; likely Justin, possibly Sofia &#8212; was getting hate on her behalf.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what she wants to see. There are real people on the other ends of those Twitter accounts, folks.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Speaking of speaking out, this week, Lindsay Krman-Hartley came to Justin&#8217;s defense.</p>
<p>Lindsay, who was married to Justin and shares a (now high school aged) daughter with him, called Justin an &quot;exemplifcation of a solid man.&quot;</p>
<p>Their daughter, Isabella Justice Hartley, echoed her mother&#8217;s sentiments by sharing them on Instagram.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>It should be noted, speaking of Isabella and Instagram, that Isabella and Sofia are Instagram mutuals.</p>
<p>While there are many reasons to follow someone on social media, the simplest explanation is that Justin&#8217;s daughter and girlfriend are fond of each other.</p>
<p>Whatever did or did not happen, we hope that all parties involved can move forward with grace, find happiness, and live their best lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p><em>Selling Sunset</em> viewers are reeling from the revelation that <a href="/videos/justin-hartley-texted-chrishell-stause-that-he-was-divorcing-her/">Justin Hartley divorced Chrishell Stause via text</a>.</p>
<p>But some of Chrishell&#8217;s supporters are a little <em>too </em>enthusiastic, and she&#8217;s asking them to be nicer.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chrishell found out via text message that Justin Hartley had filed for divorce.</p>
<p>45 minutes later, the entire world knew. She was totally caught off guard.</p>
<p>A lot of people on social media are taking her side &#8212; since she is the one who is sharing her story.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I SO appreciate all the love you guys have given for #SellingSunset&nbsp; wow!&quot; Chrishell tweeted this week.</p>
<p>&quot;That being said,&quot; she continued, &quot;some of you are attacking a certain person in defending me.&quot;</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the person who is being attacked is Justin, though that is the subject of some debate.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I appreciate the sentiment,&quot; Chrishell told her fans and followers.</p>
<p>She wrote that she appreciates their intention &quot;because certain things made me mad too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Chrishell expressed, &quot;I hate feeling like someone is getting bullied.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;Want to help empower women,&quot; Chrishell said of her goals.</p>
<p>&quot;And if my tweet has any say at all,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>Chrishell requested: &quot;I just hope you can keep the passion but maybe minus the vitriol..?&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Love you guys SO much though,&quot; Chrishell expressed.</p>
<p>Her tweet concluded: &quot;and LOVE your enthusiam!&quot;</p>
<p>That was not her only public commentary, however.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Chrishell has clearly been fighting an internal struggle.</p>
<p>She wants to both show her appreciation for support and take the high road.</p>
<p>In the case of the above tweet, she replied with the skull emoji &#8212; indicating that she is &quot;dead,&quot; as in totally floored and entertained.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Writer, podcaster, and internet personality Ira Madison III used a popular meme of Kris Jenner wielding a gun.</p>
<p>The implication was that he was moved to homicidal violence (only jokingly) by Justin&#8217;s divorce text.</p>
<p>Chrishell&#8217;s response shows her internal debate as to whether or not she should &quot;like&quot; the entertaining tweet.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Another used a blast from the post from <em>Sex And The City</em>, referring to Charlotte&#8217;s reaction to being left at the altar.</p>
<p>The fan used the tweet to convey that they &quot;curse the day&quot; that Justin Hartley was born.</p>
<p>Chrishell was visibly entertained, informing the fan that this is, in fact, her favorite gif.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>As we mentioned, it may be that others and not just Justin were targets of the &quot;bullying&quot; described by Chrishell.</p>
<p>In addition to her on-screen &quot;bully,&quot; there is also Sofia Pernas.</p>
<p>Sofia Pernas and Justin are currently dating. They also both filmed relatively nearby each other last summer.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The fan theory is that they had some sort of fling and that Justin waited until a fight with Chrishell to use as an excuse to leave her.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not so sure that we buy that theory, and we&#8217;d be leery of making an accusation like that without a shred of evidence.</p>
<p>Among other issues, Justin and Sofia have known each other for years &#8212; they were castmates on <em>The Young And The Restless</em> half a decade ago.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Justin&#8217;s (other) ex-wife, Lindsay Korman-Hartley has shown her support for Justin during this awkward time.</p>
<p>His daughter, Isabella Justice Hartley, is a rising high school junior, and she has also shown her support for her dad.</p>
<p>This is likely a very complicated and emotional time for everyone involved. That&#8217;s the nature of divorce, especially when the people getting divorced are on TV.</p>

<p>Now, Justin&#8217;s <em>other </em>ex-wife and the daughter they share are clapping back in his defense.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;In a day when social media should be used for positivity &hellip;&quot; Lindsay Korman-Hartley&#8217;s Instagram post begins.</p>
<p>She adds that social media should be used as &quot;an inspiration towards movement in an honest and deserving way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;d like to join,&quot; Lindsay writes, &quot;by highlighting my appreciation for my family.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Today, I appreciate my ex-husband Justin,&quot; Lindsay comments, referring to Justin Hartley.</p>
<p>She appreciates him &quot;for not only being [an] exemplification of a solid man.&quot;</p>
<p>Lindsay&#8217;s post continues: &quot;but for being my dear friend and devoted father to our daughter.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;Simply put; for being family,&quot; Lindsay expresses.</p>
<p>&quot;We derive our own opinion of people by experiencing life and time together,&quot; she acknowledges.</p>
<p>Lindsay&#8217;s post concludes: &quot;And we do our best to hold dear the ones that maintain consistent kindness, love, and generosity.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Lindsay is not the only member of the family who is currently singing Justin&#8217;s praises on social media.</p>
<p>Their shared daughter, Isabella Justice Hartley, also chimed in.</p>
<p>The high school junior shared her mother&#8217;s post to her own Instagram Stories for her followers to see.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Lindsay and Isabella both very tastefully avoided directly addressing Justin&#8217;s current controversy.</p>
<p>But with the premiere of the new season of Selling Sunset, star Chrishell Stause had a lot to say about her divorce from Justin.</p>
<p>She said that he informed her that he was divorcing her via text message, leaving her suddenly looking for a place to stay.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Of course, fans have only heard Chrishell&#8217;s version of events, since she is the one speaking out.</p>
<p>She says that she was &quot;blindsided,&quot; matching reports from friends of the erstwhile couple that it was an unexpected split.</p>
<p>Many have expressed sympathy for Chrishell, which is understandable &#8212; she is deeply sad about this.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Of course, some have taken things further, replacing sympathy with accusations.</p>
<p>Some have argued that Justin filmed in Canada at the same time as Sofia Pernas, his current girlfriend, was shooting.</p>
<p>Their theory is that he cheated on Chrishell and then waited until they had a big fight to file divorce papers.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The reality is that, in addition to Canada being a pretty big place, Justin knew Sofia for years.</p>
<p>The two actors both appeared on the Marco Anicelli arc of <em>The Young And The Restless</em> beginning in 2014.</p>
<p>Sofia&#8217;s character was dating Noah Newman while Justin played Noah&#8217;s uncle, the infamous Adam Newman.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>No matter what fans think, we know what Justin&#8217;s family thinks, and not just about him.</p>
<p>If you look at the people following Sofia Pernas on Instagram, you&#8217;ll see Justin&#8217;s daughter, Isabella.</p>
<p>While there are many reasons to follow someone on Instagram, following your dad&#8217;s girlfriend is usually an endorsement.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Many feel empathy for Chrishell&#8217;s obvious emotional pain, which was clearly very raw during filming <em>Selling Sunset</em>.</p>
<p>However, they have questions, like what immediately preceeded Justin&#8217;s text message to Chrishell about the divorce.</p>
<p>Chrishell alluded to a fight but, until Justin shares his full version of events and Chrishell then responds, many are reserving judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Justin Hartley may be under fire these days for the way he handled his divorce from&nbsp;Chrishell Stause.</p>
<p>But the This Is Us star doesn&#8217;t seem to care.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Because he&#8217;s also clearly under actress Sofia Pernas these days&#8230; in bed!</p>
<p>By which we mean: The two are definitely getting it on and Pernas is probably on top sometimes when they engage in intercourse.</p>
<p>Nearly three months after the handsome actor and his former The Young and the Restless costar were first linked, the pair apprently enjoyed some quality time together over the weekend.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve found the photos to prove it!</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Consider&#8230;</p>
<p>On Sunday, Pernas, posted a photo to her Instagram Story of a man leaning on a marble countertop, grasping a cigar and an iced beverage in his hands:</p>
<p>&quot;Easy like Sunday mornin,&#8217;&quot; she captioned the picture.</p>
<p>See it here:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Hours later, Hartley, posted his own snapshot of himself sitting in a pool and holding a dog in his alluring lap.</p>
<p>Atop the iimage, he wrote a nearly identical caption to the one written on Pernas&#8217; post.</p>
<p>&quot;Paisley like Sunday mornin,&#8217;&quot; the text on Hartley&#8217;s Instagram Story says.</p>
<p>One need not read between the lines here to realize that Hartley and Pernas spent the prior evening together.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Prior to getting involved with Pernas, Hartley was married to&nbsp;Chrishell Stause for about three years.</p>
<p>He asked for a divorce back in November, but the request is back in the headlines these days because a new season of Selling Sunset just premiered on Netflix.</p>
<p>And Stause is using the episodes to <a href="/2020/08/justin-hartley-to-chrishell-stause-how-dare-you-spill-our-secret/">tell her side of the split story</a>.</p>
<p>For example?</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Stause says <a href="/videos/justin-hartley-texted-chrishell-stause-that-he-was-divorcing-her/">Hartley dumped her via text message</a>, with no warning, hours after the couple got into an argument.</p>
<p>&quot;He texted me that we were filed,&quot; Stause said on air. &quot;Forty-five minutes later, the world knew.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I talked to him right after because I thought that must be a joke,&quot; Stause added. &quot;But that was kind of the end of the communication.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>During a different Selling Sunset confessional, Stause defended her reveal as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the crazy way in which this went down, people want answers, and I f&#8211;king want answers.&quot;</p>
<p>Stause also said on the program that after Hartley&#8217;s shocking divorce filing, she wrote a letter to his 16-year-old daughter Isabella, who the actor shares with his first wife, Lindsay Hartley.</p>
<p>As Stause explained: &quot;I love her so much and I had to write a letter to her.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>The suddenness of their break-up also left Stause scrambling to find a place to live</p>
<p>&quot;When I found out, I was minutes before leaving the house for work so I immediately just grabbed a few things and I just got out of there as fast as I could,&quot; she said on Selling Sunset.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t think I really knew where I was going or what I was going to do, but I just had to leave.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Hartley is reportedly mad at his ex-wife for spilling all these beans on a popular reality show &#8212; but it&#8217;s hard to have sympathy for him if he really demanded a divorce via text.</p>
<p>From June 2015 to May 2016, meanwhile, Hartley and Pernas appeared together on The Young and the Restless.</p>
<p>For the record, yes:</p>
<p>This is the same soap on which he worked with Stause.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Season 3 of Selling Sunset is streaming now on Netflix.</p>
<p>You can turn in to it to learn about high-priced real estate in California.</p>
<p>But also to learn about how much of a douche canoe Justin Hartley evidently is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Let&#8217;s get this out of the way right up front:</p>
<p>Justin Hartley is very good looking.</p>
<p>Like, VERY, VERY, VERY good looking, as evidenced by this photograph of the actor:</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>However, the recent reports about Harley&#8217;s divorce from&nbsp;Chrishell Stause are not a good look for the This Is Us star.</p>
<p>Far from it, in fact.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, <a href="/videos/justin-hartley-texted-chrishell-stause-that-he-was-divorcing-her/">Hartley alerted Stause that he wanted a divorce via text</a> message.</p>
<p>And assuming you did hear this troubling piece of news, you likely heard it from&nbsp;Stause herself&#8230; who has been spilling all the ex-couple&#8217;s secrets on her Netflix reality show, Selling Sunset.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Nine months after Hartley filed to legally split from his famous wife, the third season of the aforementioned series premiered &#8212; and this gave&nbsp;Stause a chance to tell her side of the story.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m just kind of in shock with it all,&quot; she said on air.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m trying to keep it together, but it&rsquo;s just a lot all at once &#8217;cause everybody in the whole world knows at the same time that I knew.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever been knocked over by a wave and you don&rsquo;t know which way to swim to get up?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Stause then broke down in front of cameras, prior to adding in confessional footage:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think anyone ever gets married thinking that they&rsquo;ll get a divorce. I&rsquo;m definitely a hopeless romantic, and I feel stupid even saying that out loud.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Selling Sunset,&nbsp;Stause said she did not see the divorce filing coming. Not one bit.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a fight that morning over the phone. I never saw him since,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&rsquo;t talk things through. Before we had a chance to figure anything out, he&rsquo;d filed.</p>
<p>&quot;I found out because he texted me&hellip;that we were filed. Forty-five minutes later, the world knew.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Like we said, pretty terrible look for Hartley.</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s reportedly pretty angry that his former spouse is just out there, ratting him out to the streaming world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justin has not watched the episodes but has been alerted to what is said,&rdquo; a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-hartley-is-irritated-by-chrishell-stauses-split-comments/">source tells Us Weekly</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s irritated that she&rsquo;s airing their private information publicly and knows there is more to the story than is being told.</p>
<p>&quot;His close friends and family know what really happened, as does Chrishell, so ultimately it&rsquo;s her choice of what is put out there.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>In another scene from Selling Sunset, Stause said that her break-up was carried out in a &ldquo;crazy way&rdquo; &#8212; and that she was still searching for some &ldquo;answers&rdquo; about where it all went wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know people are saying we were only married two years, but it&rsquo;s like, we were together for six years,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a fight, that&rsquo;s his go-to, you know? Like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m out, I&rsquo;m out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&quot;I hate that kind of impulsive stuff, but I always just thought, you know, that&rsquo;s just an issue that we work through it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>According to various rumors and insiders, Hartley sky-rocketed to fame on This Is Us and the fame went to his head and he then decided to leave his wife.</p>
<p>Is this an accurate description?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The claims made in the show that something changed in Justin after his This is Us fame are completely false,&rdquo; the source tells this magazine, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chrishell knows that&rsquo;s not what happened, so for her to let people believe that is upsetting to him.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While he&#8217;s angry at his ex, however, Hartley is dating The Young and the Restless star&nbsp;Sofia Pernas and seemingly doing quite well these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justin is in a good place,&rdquo; the source concludes. &ldquo;[He] wants to just move on.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Justin Hartley and Chrishell Stause divorced late last year, leaving the <em>Selling Sunset</em> star emotionally devastated.</p>
<p>But with he fallout from that split set to play out on the new season, fans are still wondering <em>why </em>the two divorced in the first place.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>Selling Sunset</em> was already an interesting show &#8212; most realty shows focus on the buyers, not on the realtors.</p>
<p>But Season 3 of the Netflix series, which premieres on August 7, 2020, is expected to be jam packed with divorce drama.</p>
<p>Chrishell stars on <em>Selling Sunset</em> and, last November, <em>This Is Us</em> hottie Justin Hartley filed for divorce.</p>

<p>Justin began dating Chrishell at some point before January 2014, which is when their relationship was officially confirmed.</p>
<p>Two and a half years later, in July of 2016, the pair announced that they were engaged to be married.</p>
<p>On October 28, 2017, Justin and Chrishell were married. Unfortunately, it would not last.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In November 2019, after only 25 months of marriage, Justin filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; &#8212; which of course tells us nothing.</p>
<p>Just weeks later, in December, Chrishell filed for the dissolution of the marriage.</p>
<p>She was visibly distraught over the end of the marriage. And, on social media, Chrishell appeared to possibly shade Justin for &quot;changing&quot; before her eyes.</p>

<p>Justin did not appear on <em>Selling Sunset</em>, but Chrishell&#8217;s fellow realtor, Christine Quinn, offered up her thoughts last month.</p>
<p>She said that Justin and Chrishell had tried some sort of relationship counseling, to no avail.</p>
<p>Chrisitne had also claimed that Justin was a private person, which is why he did not want to appear on reality TV.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;I just learned Christine is giving press &#8216;information&#8217; about my divorce,&quot; Chrishell tweeted in distress.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me be VERY clear,&quot; she announced, &quot;She knows absolutely nothing about the situation and is obviously desperate to gain attention by doing so.&quot;</p>
<p>Chrishell declared that &quot;Anything from her is either a complete lie or total conjecture on her part.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s so frustrating and unfortunate that someone would use someone&rsquo;s personal painful situation to get press for themselves,&quot; Chrishell lamented.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&rsquo;t say I am surprised,&quot; she added shadily, &quot;but please check the source.&quot;</p>
<p>Chrishell emphasized: &quot;She has absolutely zero knowledge of the marriage we had.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To be fair, it doesn&#8217;t sound like much of anyone saw this split coming.</p>
<p>Reports say that everyone close to them was stunned.</p>
<p>While some insiders have since claimed that Justin was unhappy with the marriage for some time, there have been no specifics, making it sound like speculation.</p>

<p>Chrishell and Justin worked things out in terms of property devision and matters like that in July.</p>
<p>It sounds like, as is the case between Justin and his previous wife (and mother of his daughter), things are amicable.</p>
<p>While we do not know the exact cause of the split, we can expect much more about their divorce &#8212; at least from Chrishell&#8217;s side of things &#8212; play out on <em>Selling Sunset</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chrishell has joked about dating various A-listers in Hollywood, but appears to have taken some time to heal.</p>
<p>She has openly spoken about still harboring a lot of love for Justin, despite how things ended.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justin was seen in May spending time with a familiar face.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Sofia Pernas is a gorgeous and talented actress, and she and Justin appear to be dating. She also follows his daughter on Instagram.</p>
<p>While she is best known for <em>Blood and Treasure</em> and Justin is best known for <em>This Is Us</em>, the two were castmates for a while on <em>The Young and the Restless</em>.</p>
<p>We wish everyone involved the best emotional health that can follow a divorce.</p>
