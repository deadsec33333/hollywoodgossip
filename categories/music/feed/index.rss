<p>Clem Burke, the drummer best known for his work with the seminal rock band Blondie, has passed away.</p>



<p>He was 70 years old.</p>



<p>News of Burke&#8217;s passing comes to us courtesy of a statement from the band.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clem-burke-s-cause-of-death-revealed">Clem Burke&#8217;s cause of death revealed</h2>



<p>“It is with profound sadness that we relay news of the passing of our beloved friend and bandmate Clem Burke following a private battle with cancer,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/clem-burke-blondie-drummer-dead-obituary-1235311703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reps for Blondie wrote</a>. </p>



<p>“Clem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie. His talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable,&#8221; the statement continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Beyond his musicianship, Clem was a source of inspiration both on and off the stage. His vibrant spirit, infectious enthusiasm and rock solid work ethic touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-epic-career-behind-the-kit">An epic career behind the kit</h2>



<p>Burke joined Blondie in 1975 and appeared on all of the band&#8217;s albums.</p>



<p>When they went their separate ways in 1982, he went on to become one of the industry&#8217;s most in-demand session drummers.</p>



<p>“A self-proclaimed ‘Rock &amp; Roll survivalist,’ he played and collaborated with numerous iconic artists, including Eurythmics, Ramones, Bob Dylan, Bob Geldof, Iggy Pop, Joan Jett, Chequered Past, The Fleshtones, The Romantics, Dramarama, The Adult Net, The Split Squad, The International Swingers, L.A.M.F., Empty Hearts, Slinky Vagabond, and even the Go-Go’s,” the band wrote in today&#8217;s statement.</p>

<p>“His influence and contributions have spanned decades and genres, leaving an indelible mark on every project he was a part of.”</p>



<p>Much more than just a drummer, Burke was involved in all aspects of Blondie&#8217;s music and aesthetic as the band made history with songs like &#8220;One Way or Another,&#8221; &#8220;Heart of Glass,&#8221; and &#8220;Call Me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We extend our deepest condolences to Clem’s family, friends, and fans around the world. His legacy will live on through the tremendous amount of music he created and the countless lives he touched,&#8221; today&#8217;s statement concluded.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we navigate this profound loss, we ask for privacy during this difficult time. Godspeed, Dr. Burke.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Though Selena Gomez appears to disparage ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber in her new album, that is not her focus.</p>



<p><em>He </em>is not her focus. Not anymore. She has a successful career <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/selena-gomez-engaed-to-benny-blanco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a fiance</a>.</p>



<p>But after Bieber&#8217;s latest post on social media, some fans wonder if part of him is still hung up on her.</p>



<p>Others are just focusing upon Selena&#8217;s first album in half a decade.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Selena Gomez is gorgeous on March 2, 2025 at the Oscars." class="wp-image-521843" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0321_selenagomez_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Selena Gomez attends the 97th Annual Oscars at Dolby Theatre on March 02, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-has-a-new-album-full-of-sad-ballads-and-bops">Selena Gomez has a new album full of sad ballads and bops</h2>



<p>In Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&#8217;s joint album, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWJ8SWD7?crid=3DA491KS9Q1VM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.d3rBHPNRY2qlMVhXdcSrWo4kzP947HvYxklU30XYyjgvtYFvf7o6A4f0tEqMdGdDcz6R4UkuDEZUl_96NLDZUfTZZ2BerV2umD-I_sw58AbVdtVL4lffmElXYZfTLmr3mmA7ITwGdI0bKLa7pGVx_S7esIAWmal07g-QLqZsaG9qqqccrVC7tGAtBVhAVOEcvXPou5aZf9HJ3IdTHlYnnOMWeClC4FkoDu1KzqsAVIY.zHGS_8Yt629HHGaJT1AKeCRGQT_vKI43ZUVMpujmOSc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=selena+gomez+i+said+i+love+you+first+mp3&amp;qid=1742568381&amp;sprefix=%2Caps%2C121&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Said I Love You First</a></em>, the singer and her fiance have produced a solid set of tracks.</p>



<p>Even the strongest albums have some hits and some misses. But between <em>I Said I Love You First</em> and Lady Gaga&#8217;s <em>MAYHEM</em>, March 2025 has been a fantastic time for music. (And for television &#8230; and almost nothing else)</p>



<p>The first (actual) song on the album is &#8220;Young And Hotter Than Me,&#8221; an evocative ballad with palpable Lana Del Rey vibes. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;I used to feel like an angel/Now I&#8217;m a dog on your leash,&#8221; sends an unsubtle message. As does &#8220;We&#8217;re not gettin&#8217; any younger/But your girlfriends seem to.&#8221;</p>



<p>After concluding the song about the straying ex whom she wishes that she had &#8220;never loved&#8221; in the first place, Selena sings about falling back in with a former boyfriend in &#8220;Ojos Tristes.&#8221;</p>



<p>We should be leery of assuming that we know exactly what every song means. But gosh, it sure does sound like Selena Gomez is singing about moving on from Justin Bieber.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selena-gomez-delights-with-don-t-wanna-cry">Selena Gomez delights with &#8216;Don&#8217;t Wanna Cry&#8217;</h2>



<p>Critics are already celebrating &#8220;Don&#8217;t Wanna Cry&#8221; as a success &#8212; and a career highlight. Spring began on Thursday but <em>some </em>are calling it a contender for Song of the Summer. (That&#8217;s probably premature, and I say that as a diehard Selena fan)</p>



<p>“Now I found another hand to hold,” Selena Gomez sings, referring to moving on from Justin Bieber and other exes once she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/benny-blanco-fills-bathtub-with-nacho-cheese-as-valentines-day-surprise-for-selena-gomez-gross-or-romantic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found Benny Blanco</a>.</p>



<p>And yes, then comes &#8220;Sunset Blvd,&#8221; which is cheesy and horny and keeps threatening to discuss Blanco&#8217;s penis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Speaking of horny lyrics, &#8220;Cowboy&#8221; makes it clear why the album has &#8220;[Explicit]&#8221; in the title. The lyrics detail a lot of riding, and it&#8217;s not subtle.</p>



<p>In a similar vein is &#8220;Bluest Flame,&#8221; which really picks up about halfway through. Seriously, it&#8217;s like two different songs, and the second is a total bop. This song, too, is somewhat horny.</p>



<p>Selena Gomez once again seemingly shades Justin Bieber (and perhaps all exes) with &#8220;How Does It Feel To Be Forgotten.&#8221; The song is truly a taunt, but not an unfair one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-songs-are-about-her-romance-with-benny-blanco-but">Many songs are about her romance with Benny Blanco, but &#8230;</h2>



<p>In &#8220;You Said You Were Sorry,&#8221; Selena Gomez sings about an ex &#8212; possibly Justin Bieber &#8212; who did not apologize when he might have. While she&#8217;s happy to have moved on, she clearly wonders what might have been.</p>



<p>&#8220;I Can&#8217;t Get Enough&#8221; is more triumphant, with Selena singing about how she and Benny Blanco are totally wrapped up in each other.</p>



<p>Then, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Take It Personally&#8221; has a beautiful melody and lyrics that seem to blend empathy with ridicule. Selena is addressing a woman &#8212; perhaps her past self &#8212; going through relationship ups and downs.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The album concludes with &#8220;Scared of Loving You.&#8221;</p>



<p>This vulnerable song has Selena Gomez expressing to Benny Blanco that she fears that breaking up would be her undoing.</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re in a marriage, an engagement, a serious relationship, or discussing a serious friendship &#8212; this is the kind of fear of loss that cuts to the bone.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-justin-bieber-just-respond-to-selena-gomez">Did Justin Bieber just respond to Selena Gomez?</h2>



<p>After Selena Gomez released &#8220;I Said I Love You First,&#8221; fans believe that they spied some <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber shade</a>.</p>



<p>He posted a set of photos to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinbieber/p/DHcqO4fOXX_/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, one of which capturing his beautiful wife, Hailey Bieber.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s shade, it&#8217;s extremely subtle. Which is not, historically, Bieber&#8217;s vibe.</p>



<p>Perhaps we should all keep in mind that not everything is a veiled message to an ex. The odds are pretty good that some of Selena&#8217;s lyrics aren&#8217;t about <em>him</em>, either.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift is dropping some exciting hints.</p>



<p>After taking some down time in the wake of numerous <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-bathroom-bodyguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high profile appearances</a>, Taylor resurfaced to receive some hard-earned awards.</p>



<p>One eye-catching detail snared the attention of fans.</p>



<p>Is Taylor about to launch her long-awaited &#8220;Reputation&#8221; re-record? <em>Please say yes</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-taylor-swift-teasing-a-reputation-re-record">Is Taylor Swift teasing a &#8216;Reputation&#8217; re-record?</h2>



<p>On Monday, March 17, Taylor Swift shared a <a href="https://x.com/tswifterastour/status/1901812177016860789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> message during the iHeartRadio Music Awards 2025.</p>



<p>There, her Eras Tour received honors as the tour of the century.</p>



<p>That may sound premature, but the Eras Tour demolished touring records. </p>



<p>It is a true music success story.</p>

<p>In addition to her black sweater and plaid miniskirt, Taylor Swift wore a very distinct Jacquie Aiche necklace.</p>



<p>The necklace has the shape of a snake and is studded with a marquise diamond. </p>



<p>It retails for $9,000, which is an easy buy for the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/taylor-swift-net-worth-billionaire-status-forbes-eras-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaire</a>.</p>



<p>Fans very quickly latched onto the snake motif. After all, Taylor <em>Ssswift </em>has a history with snakes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-snakes-mean-reputation-to-swifties">Snakes mean &#8216;Reputation&#8217; to Swifties</h2>



<p>&#8220;IS THAT A SNAKE NECKLACE?&#8221; posted one excited Swiftie on social media.</p>



<p>Another chimed in with: &#8220;Rep tv in the air.&#8221;</p>



<p>As exciting as <em>reptile television</em> might sound, that actually stands for Reputation (Taylor&#8217;s Version).</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">rep tv in the air 🕯️🕯️🕯️ <a href="https://t.co/O5xnQbCxN4">pic.twitter.com/O5xnQbCxN4</a></p>&mdash; ❥ (@dailytaybrina) <a href="https://twitter.com/dailytaybrina/status/1901811261152678043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>In 2016, Kim Kardashian was an instrumental part of a pile-on against Taylor Swift. </p>



<p>In defense of her then-husband, the now proudly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bianca-censori-dumped-kanye-west-because-of-pro-nazi-remarks-insiders-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pro-Hitler Kanye West</a>, Kim posted shadily edited audio recordings from a call with Taylor. </p>



<p>Kim also likened Taylor to a &#8220;snake.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2017, Taylor came out swinging with <em>Reputation</em>. In concert, this meant displaying tremendous cobra imagery and wearing serpentine motifs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reputation-taylor-s-version-is-long-overdue">&#8216;Reputation (Taylor&#8217;s Version)&#8217; is long overdue</h2>



<p>One of the many reasons for which so many people <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/08/ariana-grande-demi-lovato-fire-scooter-braun-insiders-say-justin-bieber-has-also-cut-ties-with-controversial-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loathe Scooter Braun</a> is over the sale of the rights to Taylor&#8217;s music. Taylor did not have the chance to purchase the rights herself.</p>



<p>Thus far, Taylor Swift has re-recorded all but two of her albums. One is <em>Reputation</em>. The other is her self-titled 2006 debut album.</p>



<p>When she re-records both, she will own the entirety of her music catalogue. And fans will get to enjoy a &#8220;Taylor&#8217;s Version&#8221; of every single song.</p>

<p>Jessica Simpson is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jessica-simpson-comeback-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making music again</a>, and we are all so grateful.</p>



<p>In addition to being a glaring example of how the turn-of-the-century entertainment industry treated young women, she&#8217;s a talent.</p>



<p>Naturally, fans are overjoyed to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jessica-simpson-hints-that-eric-johnson-cheated-in-new-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hear Simpson sing</a> after such a lengthy hiatus.</p>



<p>There was one little hiccup along the way. Is she okay?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-after-15-years-jessica-simpson-is-performing-again">After 15 years, Jessica Simpson is performing again!</h2>



<p>Jessica Simpson swooped in to perform at the Recording Academy&#8217;s Austin Chapter Block Party at South By Southwest, the film and music festival.</p>



<p>Stepping onto the stage in Austin marked her first performance in 15 years.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/13/jessica-simpson-returns-to-stage-austin-texas-sxsw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> </em>reports that Simpson spoke about how performing will help her to become reacquainted with who she is. Her goal is to &#8220;forget who they told&#8221; her to be. It sounds like <em>they </em>could be a lot of people.</p>

<p>During Jessica Simpson&#8217;s performance, she blended classic hits as well as music from her upcoming album.</p>



<p>&#8220;Breadcrumbs&#8221; was one of the songs. It will also feature on her <em>Nashville Canyon Part 1</em> EP, which releases later in March.</p>



<p>Simpson also delighted the crowd with her &#8220;These Boots Are Made For Walkin'&#8221; cover. You have to respect the classics. </p>



<p>The Jessica Simpson classics, specifically, even if the song was a Nancy Sinatra original.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She performed songs from the upcoming EP “Nashville Canyon, Pt.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-jessica-simpson-okay">Is Jessica Simpson okay?</h2>



<p>&#8220;Hey everybody, it&#8217;s Jessica Simpson. We just landed in Austin, and right now I&#8217;m going to wait in line at Enterprise. This is not an ad, but I&#8217;m getting a rental car,&#8221; she announced in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicasimpson/reel/DHHecQeueZM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> video.</p>



<p>Obviously, most fans and followers were delighted.</p>



<p>Some, however, asked if she was okay, with one commenter specifically asking: &#8220;What&#8217;s with the slurring?&#8221; regarding her speech.</p>

<p>Follow-up comments joked &#8212; or perhaps merely half-joked &#8212; that perhaps Jessica Simpson had enjoyed a &#8220;cocktail&#8221; or two during her flight.</p>



<p>We should emphasize that the singer has been sober for over 7 years.</p>



<p>Just last summer, she <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jessica-simpson-responds-to-rumor-that-shes-drinking-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quashed rumors that she was drinking again</a>. Sometimes, words just don&#8217;t come out quite right. Especially after something as draining as a flight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-her-songs-about-her-divorce">Are her songs about her divorce?</h2>



<p>As we reported early this year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jessica-simpson-divorce-eric-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Simpson split</a> from Eric Johnson following ten years of marriage. The breakup followed months of marital speculation.</p>



<p>Simpson&#8217;s song, &#8220;Leave,&#8221; has lyrics such as &#8220;you made it tragic&#8221; and &#8220;giving her what you gave to me&#8221; that some believe contain a veiled accusation that Johnson cheated during their marriage.</p>



<p>Only time will tell whether that interpretation is a bit of a leap or right on the money.</p>

<p>Dolly Parton sings &#8220;If You Hadn&#8217;t Been There&#8221; in honor of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/carl-dean-cause-of-death-dolly-partons-husband-gone-at-82/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her late husband</a>.</p>



<p>Carl Dean, whom she marred nearly 60 years ago, died on March 3.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carl and I fell in love when I was 18 and he was 23, and like all great love stories, they never end,&#8221; she penned in the post.</p>



<p>&#8220;They live in memory and in song, and I dedicate this to him,&#8221; Dolly Parton wrote, making it clear that &#8220;If You Hadn&#8217;t Been There&#8221; is a tribute.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t been there / Where would I be? / Without your trust, love and belief,&#8221; she sings. &#8220;The ups and downs / We&#8217;ve always shared / And I wouldn&#8217;t be here, if you hadn&#8217;t been there.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dolly-parton-and-carl-dean-were-married-for-nearly-60-years">Dolly Parton and Carl Dean were married for nearly 60 years</h2>



<p>Carl Thomas Dean passed away on Monday, March 3.</p>



<p>The late husband of Dolly Parton was 82 years old.</p>



<p>The two had been married for 58 years.</p>

<p>Dolly Parton and the man who inspired &#8220;If You Hadn&#8217;t Been There&#8221; and so much more married in 1966.</p>



<p>However, despite spending well over half a century at her side as she became one of the most beloved cultural figures on the planet, Dean himself was a fairly private person.</p>



<p>As such, he avoided the limelight, making very rare public statements. </p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter has ruffled some British feathers with a <em>very </em>Sabrina Carpenter performance.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, the still somewhat <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/sabrina-carpenter-and-barry-keoghan-call-it-quits-after-one-year-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly single singer</a> hopped across the pond to perform at the BRIT Awards.</p>



<p>She performed a mash-up of &#8220;Espresso&#8221; and &#8220;Bed Chem,&#8221; interspersed with some rousing British instrumentals.</p>



<p>So what&#8217;s the problem? Apparently, this performance was simply too <em>steamy </em>for some of the tea-drinking audience. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-has-the-brits-so-steamed-about-sabrina-carpenter">What has the Brits so steamed about Sabrina Carpenter?</h2>



<p>Some folks prefer their shows a little tepid. By some standards, Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s needed more time to cool. (Is that a tea joke or an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-meaning-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Espresso&#8221;</a> pun? You decide)</p>



<p>On Saturday, March 1, Sabrina delighted the live audience with her performance of the mash-up. </p>



<p>On stage, Sabrina wore a sparkling jacket &#8212; one that she paired with dancers dressed as royal guards &#8212; over some very thorough red lingerie. Her backup dancers were split between the guardsmen and the lingerie-clad synchronized dancers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This delightful performance was exactly what anyone familiar with Sabrina Carpenter might expect. However, not everyone has the &#8220;Taste&#8221; (Get it? She has a song with that title) to be familiar with her work.</p>



<p>Furious British viewers took to the tattered remains of what was once Twitter to howl and wail over the &#8220;pure soft porn&#8221; that they had witnessed. (If that&#8217;s soft porn, what is their actual porn like? Mouth-kissing?)</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s cool to be sexy and empowered. Unfortunately, this throw back was none of those things. Cheap and tacky,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/AnneStockton01/status/1896009102721237130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spat</a> one disgruntled viewer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sabrina-carpenter-learned-what-watershed-means">Sabrina Carpenter learned what &#8216;watershed&#8217; means</h2>



<p>When it comes to British television, &#8220;watershed&#8221; is the cutoff point at which the BBC may air television that might be unsuitable for children. Usually, this time is around 9 PM.</p>



<p>Another social media user <a href="https://x.com/PaulKirkby3/status/1896211991414599980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>: &#8220;Some people threatening to complain to Ofcom about Sabrina Carpenter&#8217;s BRIT Awards performance need to get a life.&#8221;</p>



<p>The presumably British fan continued: &#8220;It was a fun show with great energy! If you can&#8217;t handle a little excitement before 9 pm, maybe it&#8217;s time to lighten up!&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Sabrina Carpenter herself shared photos from the BRIT Awards and a somewhat cheeky caption.</p>



<p>&#8220;I now know what watershed is!!!!&#8221; she wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGtGcLyPJM3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, when a lot of enraged people from beans-on-toast island start posting your name and &#8220;watershed,&#8221; you&#8217;re going to look up what it means.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-698x1024.jpg" alt="Sabrina Carpenter dances at the Brit Awards on March 1, 2025." class="wp-image-520657" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-205x300.jpg 205w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-1396x2048.jpg 1396w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-654x960.jpg 654w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-736x1080.jpg 736w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-818x1200.jpg 818w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/0304_sabrinacarpenter_03-scaled.jpg 1745w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sabrina Carpenter performs on stage during The BRIT Awards 2025 at The O2 Arena on March 01, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-a-familiar-experience-for-her">This is a familiar experience for her</h2>



<p>For years, some truly bizarre people have targeted Sabrina Carpenter with outrage over her performances. </p>



<p>Her wardrobe is actually not that different from many other singers, and her dancing is far from the most erotic.</p>



<p>It is possible that some of her detractors are infantalizing Sabrina because she is 5 feet tall, even though she&#8217;s a grown woman. But let&#8217;s be honest: when have weirdos <em>ever </em>needed an excuse to condemn a woman for showing a hint of sexuality?</p>

<p>Bob Dylan is one of the most important figures in all of rock music. And now, over 60 years into his career, he&#8217;s the subject of the new biopic <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>starring Timothée Chalamet. </p>



<p>Timothée&#8217;s performance is already getting buzz, and it seems likely that the movie will be a hit! The James Mangold-directed film is set in the first half of the 60s, chronicling Bob&#8217;s arrival in New York up until his 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance.</p>



<p>The movie is set to hit theaters on Christmas Day 2024, and critics are already starting to praise Timothée&#8217;s portrayal of Bob. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> for the film gave fans a sneak peak in October 2024.</p>

<p>Before going to see Timothée bring Bob&#8217;s early days to the big screen, there are lots of things to know about the <em>Blonde on Blonde </em>singer. Keep reading to learn more about Bob.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-real-name-isn-t-bob-dylan">His Real Name Isn&#8217;t Bob Dylan</h2>



<p>It may come as a surprise to some, but Bob Dylan&#8217;s real name is not &#8220;Bob Dylan.&#8221; Bob was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Minnesota in 1941. </p>



<p>As to why Bob chose &#8220;Dylan&#8221; for his surname, the most common legend refers to him borrowing it from the poet <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/dylan-thomas-patti-smith-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Thomas</a>, who was shouted out on Taylor Swift&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/the-tortured-poets-department-everything-we-know-about-taylor-swifts-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>.</a></p>

<p>Despite this being the most common claim, the man himself actually denied those rumors in a 1961 <em>New York Times</em> interview. &#8220;I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas,&#8221; he said, via <em><a href="https://wmgk.com/2018/05/24/bob-went-zimmerman-dylan/">WMGK</a></em>. &#8220;Dylan Thomas’ poetry is for people that aren’t really satisfied in their bed – for people who dig masculine romance.&#8221; </p>



<p>He did explain that he always intended on changing his name in his memoir <em>Chronicles: Volume 1</em>. He didn&#8217;t explain if there was a deeper meaning to choosing &#8220;Dylan&#8221; as his last name.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first time I was asked my name in the Twin Cities, I instinctively and automatically, without thinking, simply said: ‘Bob Dylan,'&#8221; he wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just called myself Robert Allen. As far as I was concerned, that was who I was – that’s what my parents named me. It sounded like the name of a Scottish king, and I liked it. There was little of my identity that wasn’t in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob has a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/10/bob-dylan-to-nobel-prize-committee-keep-your-sh-tty-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discography</a>. When you&#8217;ve been making music for over 60 years, you&#8217;ve had a lot of time to make some albums, and there&#8217;s plenty of Dylan material for new fans to dive into.</p>



<p>Bob&#8217;s first album was 1962&#8217;s self-titled record, and his most recent was 2023&#8217;s <em>Shadow Kingdom</em>. Over the past 60 years, Bob has released tons of classics like <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/11/bob-dylan-drops-like-a-rolling-stone-music-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highway 61 Revisited</a>, Blood on the Tracks, </em>and many more.</p>



<p>Many of Bob&#8217;s early hits weren&#8217;t for his own performances. Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221;, &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221;, and &#8220;Mr. Tambourine Man&#8221; were all <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/keith-urban-miley-cyrus-ashtray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered by other musicians</a>. Artists like Nina Simone, The Byrds, and Peter, Paul, and Mary recorded their own versions of Bob&#8217;s songs. </p>



<p>Aside from the studio albums, Bob has countless live records, bootlegs, compilations, and writing credits for other hits.</p>

<p>Bob was a major figure in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Many of his songs were considered protest anthems, and they spoke about the civil rights that people were fighting for. </p>



<p>Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221; and &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221; both expressed ideas about the civil rights movement and the fight against racism. Bob&#8217;s song &#8220;Only a Pawn in Their Game&#8221; is about the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers.</p>



<p>Perhaps most notably, Bob also performed at the 1963 March on Washington. He and fellow folk singer Joan Baez were both slated performers, per <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-dylan-only-a-pawn-in-their-game-1963-martin-luther-king-1011996/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a></em>. Bob&#8217;s four song set is not as well known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s famous &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech, which he delivered that day.</p>

<p>One of the most famous moments in Bob&#8217;s career, which is also featured in <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>was his 1965 performance at the Newport Folk Festival. </p>



<p>After making a name for himself as a folk musician (and acoustic performer), Bob shocked the crowd at the 1965 festival by performing with an electric guitar. He was met with outrage.</p>



<p>Bob only managed to play three songs, before he was booed off stage. Many folk fans felt that Bob was betraying his fanbase by performing with electric instruments. Some people had clearly thought he&#8217;d sold out.</p>



<p>Despite the controversy, many of the songs with electric instruments have since gone on to be classics. His first electric song &#8220;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#8221; is a beloved classic, and many of the tracks on <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> are regarded as classics, now.</p>

<p>Over the years, Bob has gotten to share the stage with tons of classic artists. Joan Baez was one of the biggest names that he performed with early in his career. Still, there are two bands that Bob is most often grouped with.</p>



<p>Most famously, Bob is associated with The Band. The classic rockers were already an established act, but Dylan recruited them to be his backing band beginning in 1966. Notably, Bob is the one who changed their name to The Band.</p>



<p>When The Band played their farewell concert <em>The Last Waltz </em>in 1976, Bob joined them for a few songs.</p>



<p>In the late 80s and early 90s, Bob was also a member of the Traveling Wilburys. The supergroup also included George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. They put out two albums together.</p>

<p>While plenty of artists slow down on the road as they get older, that&#8217;s not really the case for Bob. In June 1988, Bob set out on the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. Bob has been on the road consistently ever since. </p>



<p>He usually plays about 100 shows per year, and even though his 2021-2024 tour was dubbed the &#8220;Rough and Rowdy Ways&#8221; tour, many still consider it part of the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. </p>



<p>While many people will likely be interested in catching Bob after seeing <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, it is worth the warning that he does make significant changes to his songs live. Fans often complain about how difficult it can be to tell what songs he&#8217;s performing at recent concerts.</p>

<p>The singer had to call off his his final show in Columbus, Ohio after falling ill. It was <em>extremely </em>last-minute.</p>



<p>Just moments earlier, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-split-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wife Jessica Biel</a> had been singing his praises over the Forget Tomorrow World Tour. </p>



<p>Now, <em>no one&#8217;s</em> singing, and she&#8217;s getting trolled pretty hard.</p>

<p>On Thursday night, Jessica Biel took to her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicabiel/reel/DGldIEuRG-K/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> go gush over husband Justin Timberlake.</p>



<p>He was in the midst of wrapping up the US stretch of his Forget Tomorrow World Tour &#8212; the one that he made infamous through his arrest last year.</p>



<p>“There’s truly nothing this man can’t do,” Biel raved. “It’s been so special to watch you, listen to you, and be alongside you for this tour. One last show tonight, give it all you’ve got. I am the proudest.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was very sweet. It also did not age well &#8212; at all.</p>



<p>Almost immediately after his wife&#8217;s post, Justin Timberlake had to call off the February 27 show. </p>



<p>His fans in Columbus, Ohio &#8212; some of whom had traveled there specifically to see him &#8212; were already lining up. The doors were open.</p>



<p>As it turned out, Timberlake has the flu and was too sick to perform.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jessica-biel-got-an-earful-from-justin-timberlake-fans">Jessica Biel got an earful from Justin Timberlake fans</h2>



<p>Because Justin Timberlake canceled his show at the last minute (and perhaps because he canceled another Columbus show less than a year ago), fans were reeling. Seeing Jessica Biel rave over her husband did not go over well.</p>



<p>“He canceled his last show. This post didn’t age well. Poor guy has the flu real bad,” observed one commenter.</p>



<p>Another got specific, writing: “Apparently can’t perform in Columbus because he has now canceled twice…. Taylor Swift toured for 3 years and only canceled once for a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/taylor-swift-isis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrorist plot</a>. &#8230;&#8221; Timberlake called off a June 2024 tour stop.</p>

<p>Justin Timberlake did, of course, promise refunds for the tickets that people had purchased for his canceled show.</p>



<p>“You guys. I’m heartbroken,” he expressed. “I have to cancel the show tonight. I went into soundcheck battling the&nbsp;flu&nbsp;and now it’s gotten the best of me.”</p>



<p>Timberlake lamented: “It kills me to disappoint you and my team who worked so hard to make this show happen.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perhaps-his-infamous-world-tour-has-not-had-the-best-luck">Perhaps his infamous World Tour has not had the best luck</h2>



<p>Back in June of 2024, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/justin-timberlake-mug-shot-dwi-arrest-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Timberlake&#8217;s DUI arrest</a> attracted attention. Especially because of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/justin-timberlake-said-what-to-the-police-during-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timberlake&#8217;s alleged statements</a> to the officer, lamenting that this would &#8220;ruin the tour,&#8221; then specifying &#8220;the <em>world </em>tour.&#8221;</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t just turn heads. Reports of his silly statement spawned memes &#8212; memes used by people who had no idea that he was the source.</p>



<p>Now, he&#8217;s had to (once again) cancel a Columbus concert. This time, over the flu. And poor Jessica Biel is getting trolled over it.</p>

<p>Rebecca Black is such a remarkable talent and a dazzling entertainer.</p>



<p>Unless you checked out after her 2011 viral video and the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/06/rebecca-black-reads-youtube-hate-comments-you-sing-like-a-sick-d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindless hate</a> that she received, that isn&#8217;t new.</p>



<p>What <em>is </em>new is Rebecca&#8217;s new hyper-pop track, &#8220;Salvation.&#8221; </p>



<p>The song is a joy. So, too, is the music video, which features Rebecca living out a nearly universal dream: becoming a young, hot, rich widow, possibly by dubious means.</p>

<p></p>



<p>On Thursday, February 27, the incomparable Rebecca Black unleashed &#8220;Salvation.&#8221; </p>



<p>Part of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1iz28w7/rebecca_black_salvation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very well received</a> seven-song album by the same name, &#8220;Salvation&#8221; tells &#8212; lyrically &#8212; the story of someone whose passionate sexual escapades are receiving external judgment. </p>



<p>Whether the judgy party is homophobic or merely a generic prude is open to interpretation, as it could just as easily be an ex who&#8217;s simmering with disapproval.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>It is the &#8220;Salvation&#8221; music video itself in which Rebecca Black shines as much as she does in the recording studio.</p>



<p>As you can see in the official music video above, Rebecca is absolutely dominating in skimpy, festive outfits with a Western motif.</p>



<p>Thematic elements include liberation. Visual elements include a lot of dancing, some cheeky butt shots, and some oily and handsy shots that look straight out of the incredible <em>Teen Wolf</em> intro sequence.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-story-is-rebecca-black-telling">What story is Rebecca Black telling?</h2>



<p>In the music video itself, Rebecca Black portrays a newly minted widow. Young, hot, and inappropriately dressed for a funeral, she triumphantly reads from the will in front of the casket of her comically old, deceased husband.</p>



<p>While she reads out exactly how wealthy she has now become, the somewhat campy mourners wail and lament. It seems that their grief has given way to despair upon realizing that they are not getting a piece of the financial pie.</p>



<p>What follows is a lot of dancing while Rebecca dons a series of looks. Some appear anachronistic, several are over-the-top, and a bunch are downright <em>enthralling</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Salvation&#8221; comes two months after Rebecca Black blew fans&#8217; minds with &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJNUSg6_ibw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugar Water Cyanide</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>While the official lyric video has a lower production level than &#8220;Salvation,&#8221; the song itself has more of a dance vibe. It&#8217;s downright <em>bouncy</em>.</p>



<p>With seven tracks, and songs like &#8220;TRUST!&#8221; and &#8220;Twist The Knife,&#8221; there&#8217;s sure to be a fresh new song for everyone. Well, everyone with <em>taste</em>. (Sorry, not sorry)</p>

<p>If you find yourself looking for other music by Rebecca Black, you&#8217;re in luck. She has a stellar discography.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heart Full of Scars,&#8221; &#8220;Foolish,&#8221; and &#8220;The Great Divide (Dave Audé Remix)&#8221; happen to be some of my personal favorites from over the years. But there are so many more, including the entirety of the <em>Let Her Burn</em> album.</p>



<p>And, of course, we will always have &#8220;Friday.&#8221; As if we needed more reasons to look forward to the weekend.</p>

<p>Bhad Bhabie is dragging Travis Barker into her feud with the drummer&#8217;s daughter.</p>



<p>After her first diss track spread <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/alabama-barker-pregnant-bhad-bhabie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pregnancy rumors about Alabama</a>, it&#8217;s no wonder that she&#8217;s turning up the heat.</p>



<p>This escalation comes in the form of &#8220;Ms. Whitman,&#8221; and BB released a whole music video to go with it.</p>



<p>Bhad Bhabie is sending a message, and using a Travis Barker lookalike in the process.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-683x1024.jpg" alt="Danielle Bregoli, known professionally as Bhad Bhabie, in August of 2022." class="wp-image-520066" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/0225_bhadbhabie_01-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bhad Bhabie attends TBT Magazine Social Media Edition Powered By Berman Law at Sway Nightclub on August 26, 2022.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jason Koerner/Getty Images for TBT Magazine Powered By Berman Law Group)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-ms-whitman-bhad-bhabie-involves-travis-barker-in-her-feud-with-his-daughter">In &#8216;Ms. Whitman,&#8217; Bhad Bhabie involves Travis Barker in her feud with his daughter</h2>



<p>Both Bhad Bhabie and Alabama Barker are famous, at least in part, because of their parents. </p>



<p>BB (whose real name is Danielle Bregoli) had a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/bhad-bhabie-shares-video-of-brutal-fistfight-with-her-mom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously terrible childhood</a> and ended up on <em>Dr. Phil</em>. Meanwhile, Alabama is the daughter of Shana Moakler and Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker.</p>



<p>With that in mind, it is no surprise that Bhad Bhabie&#8217;s new diss track includes a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7_px4vXYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music video</a> that trashes Alabama Barker using a Travis lookalike.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Bhad Bhabie - Ms. Whitman (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yo7_px4vXYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“Thought I wasn’t gonna come back for more you dumb dirty b&#8212;h,” Bhad Bhabie raps, taking aim at current archenemy Alabama Barker.</p>



<p>“Why this b&#8212;h obsessed with me?&#8221; BB demands in the diss track. &#8220;I just don’t understand.”</p>



<p>However the eye-catching detail &#8212; that Bhad Bhabie included a Travis Barker lookalike in her music video &#8212; drew more attention than the lyrics themselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-s-not-the-real-travis-barker-in-bhad-bhabie-s-music-video-of-course">That&#8217;s not the real Travis Barker in Bhad Bhabie&#8217;s music video, of course</h2>



<p>After Bhad Bhabie released the diss track and accompanying music video on February 25, social media erupted with people pointing out the Travis Barker lookalike.</p>



<p>That is to say, BB hired a profoundly slender man to wear a beanie and play the drums behind her while she puts Alabama on blast.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t a tin hat theory. She&#8217;s shading Alabama with a conspicuous depiction of her father &#8212; reminding the world why Alabama is famous.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ALABAMA BARKER WOKE THE REAL BHAD BABIE UP <a href="https://t.co/fX0q1tzVgQ">pic.twitter.com/fX0q1tzVgQ</a></p>&mdash; tyris ✰ (@TYRISPRINT) <a href="https://twitter.com/TYRISPRINT/status/1894253311500431701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 



<p>Remember, this juvenile feud (Bhad Bhabie is 21 and will turn 22 next month and has numerous behavioral issues, while Alabama Barker is only 19) started over a man. And not the kind that you&#8217;d want to fight over.</p>



<p>BB accused Alabama of &#8220;stealing&#8221; Le Vaughn, her toxic ex and also the father of her 11-month-old daughter, Kali Love.</p>



<p>Alabama hit back at the accusation in late 2024, reporting that Vaughn was lying to them both. But this only served to further enrage Bhad Bhabie, for some reason. (We <em>did </em>mention the behavioral issues)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-is-a-silver-lining-to-this-ugly-feud">There is a silver lining to this ugly feud</h2>



<p>Since their late 2024 disagreement erupted into a petty mess, both Alabama Barker and Bhad Bhabie have released diss tracks about each other.</p>



<p>Honestly? Music from both of these young women has been great. That&#8217;s no surprise from BB, but many hadn&#8217;t realized that Alabama could come out with such a good diss track.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d say that the real winners are the fans who get to enjoy the music of true haters. But maybe the real winners are those of us who are grownups and do not have to get into bitter feuds over undesirable men.</p>



<p>That said, this has arguably been great for both of their brands. Maybe the only loser in this scenario is Le Vaughn.</p>
