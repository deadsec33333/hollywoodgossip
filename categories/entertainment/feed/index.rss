<p>But the drama is being roasted left and right at the moment for a reason that has nothing to do with what you see on screen&#8230;</p>
<p>And everything to do with something that happened off screen.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-900x1024.png" alt="The Crown Stars" class="wp-image-292713" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-900x1024.png 900w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-264x300.png 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-768x874.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-735x836.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-294x335.png 294w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-305x347.png 305w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-457x520.png 457w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-562x640.png 562w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-675x768.png 675w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars-844x960.png 844w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/the-crown-stars.png 913w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>During a panel discussion about the series at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday, producers acknowledged a discrepancy between the salaries of its two stars, Claire Foy and Matt Smith.</p>
<p>The former portrayed Queen Elizabeth, while the latter takes on the role of her husband,&nbsp;Prince Philip.</p>
<p>Asked directly whether Foy was paid the same as Smith, producer&nbsp;Suzanne Mackie surprised those in attendance by answering in the negative.</p>
<p>No salary figures were discussed, but Mackie admitted Smith earned more for his two seasons of work than Foy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going forward,&quot; she then noted. &quot;No one gets paid more than the Queen.&quot;</p>
<p>This change, however, will not benefit Foy, earned earned an Emmy Award for her work on Season 1.</p>
<p>Due to a time jump for Season 3,&nbsp;Olivia Colman will step in as the Queen.</p>
<p>(Helena Bonham-Carter will play Princess Margaret and Netflix has not yet confirmed which actor will portray Prince Philip.)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="516" height="679" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy.jpg" alt="Claire Foy" class="wp-image-292715" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy.jpg 516w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-228x300.jpg 228w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-255x335.jpg 255w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-264x347.jpg 264w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-395x520.jpg 395w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-486x640.jpg 486w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>In light of the ongoing #MeToo movement and the important conversation surrounding how women are treated in Hollywood, this salary difference has become a source of disgust and debate on social media.</p>
<p>Yes, Smith was a better known star when the series started shooting, having established himself for multiple seasons as the titular character on Dr. Who.</p>
<p>But Foy played THE QUEEN HERSELF on a show about&#8230; THE QUEEN.</p>
<p>Moreover, Foy simply appeared on screen a significant amount of time more than Smith over the show&#8217;s first two seasons.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was disclosed that Michelle Williams was paid a fraction of what her All The Money In The World co-star Mark Wahlberg earned for reshooting sections of the film.</p>
<p>As in: Williams was paid $80 per day and Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million total.</p>
<p>Once word of this discrepancy leaked out, Wahlberg agreed to donate that entire sum to charity.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="864" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-864x1024.png" alt="Claire Foy Picture" class="wp-image-292717" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-864x1024.png 864w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-253x300.png 253w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-768x911.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-735x872.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-283x335.png 283w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-293x347.png 293w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-439x520.png 439w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-540x640.png 540w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-648x768.png 648w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-810x960.png 810w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture-911x1080.png 911w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/claire-foy-picture.png 1012w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The third season of The Crown, which begins filming in July, will move into the Camilla Parker Bowles years; it will also introduce a young Princess Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are going to be extraordinary, those episodes,&rdquo; said Mackie.</p>
<p>But will fans keep tuning in, now that viewer favorite Foy is no longer a part of the cast?</p>
<p>And will this scandal have any long-term affect on the success of the series?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="753" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-753x1024.png" alt="Matt Smith as Prince Philip" class="wp-image-292719" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-753x1024.png 753w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-221x300.png 221w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-768x1045.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-735x1000.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-246x335.png 246w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-255x347.png 255w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-382x520.png 382w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-470x640.png 470w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-565x768.png 565w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-706x960.png 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip-794x1080.png 794w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/matt-smith-as-prince-philip.png 888w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Netflix)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Mackie didn&#8217;t address these concerns or questions, instead joking around a bit when considering where else The Crown may go.</p>
<p>Like into very modern times, perhaps?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see an episode where [Donald Trump] comes to Buckingham Palace,&rdquo; the producer said.</p>
<p>As for <a href="/slideshows/meghan-markle-19-raciest-pics-of-prince-harrys-bride-to-be/">Meghan Markle</a>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can play herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&#8217;d be down with that. But Markle better get paid more than Trump for her appearance!</p>

<p>Marlon Brando died in 2004.</p>
<p>Yet the former iconic comedian and legendary actor are in the news this week for one unexpected reason:</p>
<p>They apparently had sex&#8230; with each other!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This surprising connection was first mentioned by Quincy Jones in a wide-ranging interview with Vulture, during which the music producer said the following of Brando:</p>
<p>&quot;He was the most charming motherf-cker you ever met. He&#8217;d f-ck anything. Anything!</p>
<p>&quot;He&#8217;d f&#8211;k a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.&quot;</p>
<p>Naturally, such a statement got the Internet talking and wondering about the film star, who won two Academy Awards and is considered by some to be the best actor of all-time.</p>
<p>Just a few hours after this quote went viral, though, Pryor&#8217;s widow came out and put an end to the speculation.</p>
<p>She actually confirmed the sexual relationship!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="666" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-666x1024.jpg" alt="Richard Pryor" class="wp-image-289876" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-666x1024.jpg 666w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-195x300.jpg 195w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-768x1180.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-1000x1536.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-1333x2048.jpg 1333w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-735x1130.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-218x335.jpg 218w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-226x347.jpg 226w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-338x520.jpg 338w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-416x640.jpg 416w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-500x768.jpg 500w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-625x960.jpg 625w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-703x1080.jpg 703w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/richard-pryor-scaled.jpg 1666w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Said Jennifer Lee to TMZ when asked about the rumored dalliance:</p>
<p>&quot;It was the &#8217;70s! Drugs were still good, especially quaaludes. If you did enough cocaine, you&#8217;d f-ck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Well&#8230; okay then!</p>
<p>Pryor&#8217;s widow added that Pryor would find it hilarious that Jones spilled these beans if he were alive today and that he had no shame about his bisexuality.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Pryor and Lee were married in the early 1980s and again in 2001; they were together up until the stand-up&#8217;s death in 2005.</p>
<p>Altogether, Pryor was married to five different woman and had seven children.</p>
<p>Brando, meanwhile, was married three times and fathered 11 children.</p>
<p>They may have carried on an affair with each other at one point, but they very much got around overall. That much is clear.</p>
<p>Back in 1976, speaking to a French journalist, Brando happily opened up about his sexuality.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences, and I am not ashamed,&quot; he said at the time, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;I have never paid much attention to what people think about me. But if there is someone who is convinced that Jack Nicholson and I are lovers, may they continue to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;I find it amusing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So it sounds like he would also be amused by Jones telling the world about his banging of Pryor.</p>
<p>To put this in context, for those unfamiliar with Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando and the levels of fame each achieved back in the 1960s and 1970s:</p>
<p>This news would be akin to learning that Jerry Seinfeld had slept with Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>Hence the reaction across social media in response to Pryor&#8217;s widow&#8217;s admission.</p>

<p>The confirmation even reached actor Don Cheadle, for instance, who joked on Twitter when asked if he had slept with any male celebrities:</p>
<p>&quot;nah. that&rsquo;s not my thing. but if it was, yeah, brando back in the day could get it.&quot;</p>
<p>In his chat with Vulture, meanwhile, Jones also said he knows who killed John F. Kennedy and said he once dated Ivanka Trump.</p>
<p>In other words: this Pryor/Brando bombshell may have been the least interesting part of his Q&amp;A!</p>

Unlike when his <a href="/2014/10/jason-momoa-game-of-thrones-audition-tape-goes-viral-watch-the-d/"><em>Game of Thrones</em> audition tape went viral</a>, it was not in a positive way.</p>
<p>With the recent <a href="/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-accused-of-raping-asia-argento-forcing-himself/">allegations against Harvey Weinstein</a> that have come to light, people are talking about sexual assault and Hollywood. For the most part, it&#8217;s great that this very difficult conversation is happening.</p>
<p>An unacceptable comment that Jason Momoa made in the past came to light, stirring a lot of controversy. He has now issued an apology.</p>

<p>Jason Momoa is a popular actor. Whether you first saw him on <em>Game of Thrones</em> or <em>Stargate&nbsp;Atlantis</em> or the tragically underrated 2011 <em>Conan The Barbarian</em>, he&#8217;s a distinct actor who tends to play majorly tough characters.</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s now playing Aquaman in the DC cinematic universe, a portrayal of the classic and often lampooned DC superhero that&#8217;s likely to bring more weight to and respect for the character.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll first see him in action as Aquaman in the upcoming <em>Justice League</em> film, but he&#8217;s also getting a standalone <em>Aquaman</em> film.</p>
<p>All of that is pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a combination of fame and the internet means that Jason Momoa&#8217;s entire history is basically an open book for anyone to pick through.</p>
<p>With the Weinstein scandal and various actresses coming forward to talk about the sexual harassment and sexual assaults that they&#8217;ve endured from powerful men in the industry, more than just Harvey Weinstein have been named.</p>
<p>In fact, Jason Momoa&#8217;s&nbsp;costar, Ben Affleck &#8212; who will reprise his role as Batman in <em>Justice League</em> (which will hopefully be light years better than <em>Dawn of Justice</em> was, ugh) &#8212; has been <a href="/2017/10/ben-affleck-accused-of-groping-makeup-artist-as-harassment-scand/">accused of groping a woman at the Golden Globes</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, multiple <a href="/2017/10/ben-affleck-multiple-sexual-harassment-videos-resurface-amidst-g/">sexual harassment videos of Ben Affleck</a> have surfaced since Rose McGowan accused him of having been aware of Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s predatory behavior.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Twitter was talking about Jason Momoa.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To be clear, this was not a case of anyone accusing Jason&nbsp;Momoa&nbsp;of sexual assault or sexual harassment. This is about a comment that he made while speaking to fans about his career.</p>
<p>The comment was one that Jason Momoa made at a convention in 2011:</p>
<p>&quot;As far as&nbsp;sci-fi&nbsp;and fantasy, I love that genre because there are so many things you can do, like rip someone&rsquo;s tongue out of their throat and get away with it.&quot;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s part of why we love watching that genre. It&#8217;s a good comment.</p>
<p>If only he&#8217;d stopped there.</p>
<p>Instead, Jason Momoa continued with what was clearly a joke but which was unacceptable nonetheless.</p>
<p>&quot;And rape beautiful women.&quot;</p>
<p>YIKES.</p>
<p>Now, for backstory, we should mention that his character in the infamously rapey <em>Game of Thrones</em> is Khal Drogo, who rapes Daenerys Targaryen&nbsp;on their wedding night.</p>
<p>It appears that Momoa was trying to use humor as a vehicle to refer to the prevalence of sexual assault in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and to compliment his costar, Emilia Clarke, at the same time.</p>
<p>But &#8230; yeah, that comment is not even a little bit okay.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Late Thursday night (which would have been Friday, Down Under), Jason Momoa took to Instagram to issue an apology.</p>
<p>&quot;I awoke in Australia to the justified reaction by many people to a distasteful joke I made years ago in Hall H for which I am sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good start.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still severely disappointed in myself at the insensitivity of my remarks that day. I know my sincerest apology now won&#8217;t take away those hurtful words.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s <em>still</em> a really good apology. When do the excuses come into play?</p>
<p>&quot;Rape and sexual harassment can reach anyone and I have seen first hand its painful torment among my own family and friends.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s sadly all too true, and it&#8217;s good that he acknowledges that.</p>
<p>&quot;I made a truly tasteless comment. It is unacceptable and I sincerely apologize with a heavy heart for the words I said.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jason Momoa didn&#8217;t try to provide context or apologize or complain about how unfair it all was. He owned what he did and apologized and made it clear that jokes like that are unacceptable.</p>
<p>But since he didn&#8217;t say anything along these lines, we will.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa bent over backwards to make sure that Emilia Clarke would feel comfortable during the filming of their very uncomfortable sexual assault scene.</p>
<p>In order to inject some behind-the-scenes levity, Jason Momoa turned the sock that he wore over his genitals (that&#8217;s how networks like HBO film their nude scenes, by the way) into a sock puppet with eyes and everything.</p>
<p>This is a man who cares about women and their feelings, and he understands the seriousness of sexual assault and even how traumatic stages scenes of fictional sexual assault can be for actors involved.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re glad that he apologized and his joke in 2011 was unacceptable, but &#8230; we have to point out that it&#8217;s more than a little shady that someone decided to dig that up in 2017.</p>
<p>There are, after all, actual sexual predators and rape apologists out there.</p>

<p>As previously reported, <a href="/2017/08/ric-flair-undergoes-surgery-family-of-wrestling-star-asks-for-pr/">Flair was admitted to a hospital</a>&nbsp;near Atlanta last week and then placed in a medically-induced coma as his condition worsened.</p>
<p>He underwent significant surgery, which sources initially connected to past heart problems the former WCW and WWE champion had admitted were a result of heavy drinking over the years.</p>
<p>But Melinda Morris Zanoni, the CEO of Legacy Talent LLC and a close friend of Flair&rsquo;s, later went on record as saying the issue was NOT heart related.</p>
<p>Either way, Flair came out of the procedure on Monday and has been resting under doctor&#8217;s supervision ever since.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s out of the woods, however.</p>
<p>Wendy Barlow released a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon addressing her fiancee&#8217;s ongoing condition and rumors that have circulated online since news of his health surfaced.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="711" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-711x1024.jpg" alt="Ric Flair" class="wp-image-274639" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-711x1024.jpg 711w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-208x300.jpg 208w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-768x1106.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-1066x1536.jpg 1066w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-1422x2048.jpg 1422w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-735x1059.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-233x335.jpg 233w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-241x347.jpg 241w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-361x520.jpg 361w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-444x640.jpg 444w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-533x768.jpg 533w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-666x960.jpg 666w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-750x1080.jpg 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/ric-flair-scaled.jpg 1777w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Just want to give an update to my friends and family as I have been unable to talk on the phone without crying and just feel shocked over events,&quot; Barlow wrote, adding;&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;I took Ric to the hospital Friday night with severe abdominal pain. From that moment on it all seems like a nightmare &#8230; multiple organ problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Barlow did not specify just what caused these organ problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want everyone to know he still needs prayers as he is still in critical condition,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he did not have colon surgery&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how the media comes up with their stories.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been by his side since Friday and will continue to make sure he is getting the best care possible. Thanks for all of the support and love.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="425" height="535" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/wendy-statement.jpg" alt="Wendy Statement" class="wp-image-274874" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/wendy-statement.jpg 425w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/wendy-statement-238x300.jpg 238w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/wendy-statement-266x335.jpg 266w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/wendy-statement-276x347.jpg 276w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/wendy-statement-413x520.jpg 413w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear at the moment whether or not Flair is still in a coma.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s one of the most respected wrestlers of all time, having worked in every major organization over a career than spanned over five decades.</p>
<p>In total, the &quot;Nature Boy&quot; has held 31 championship belts.</p>
<p>A two-time WWE Hall-of-Famer, Flair had been in the news prior to this health scare because ESPN will air a documentary about him in November.</p>
<p>He spoke to reporters about the project just days before he was admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>We will continue to send our thoughts to Flair&#8217;s family and hope he makes a full recovery from whatever ails him.</p>

<p>Who will win?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t say anything for certain, except the field will be especially wide open this fall.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>This is true not only because there are more quality shows than ever before, but due to one glaring omission.</p>
<p>Because Game of Thrones Season 6 did not premiere until July, it missed the deadline of Emmy eligibility.</p>
<p>No star is nominated in any category this year and the smash hit HBO show cannot repeat as Best Drama.</p>
<p>So the door is wide open for the following actors, actresses and programs. Which of the just-announced nominees will walk excitedly and proudly through it?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll find out in a couple months&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Just over a year ago,&nbsp;Emilia Clarke appeared on Conan and made a plea for Game of Thrones to <a href="/videos/emilia-clarke-we-must-free-the-penis-on-game-of-thrones/">FREE THE PENIS</a>!</p>
<p>Alas, the epic HBO drama still depicts more female nudity than male nudity on a regular basis.</p>
<p>But at least Clarke can sleep well at night, knowing she did her best to help women around the world out a bit.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In an interview with the latest issue of Rolling Stone, meanwhile, the actress said it took her awhile to realize just what sort of effect her gender has had on her life since since she struck it big.</p>
<p>Men all over the Internet may search for&nbsp;<a href="/2016/05/emilia-clarke-nude-scene-were-those-stunt-boobs/">Emilia Clarke nude</a> photos because they&#8217;re young and horny, while fans of this series may joke about how many times they&#8217;ve seen Clarke topless&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; but the star sort of woke up one day and realized that sexism is alive and not very well.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#8217;re aware of it, and you&#8217;re aware of it, but one day, you go, &#8216;Oh, my God, it&#8217;s everywhere!&#8217; Like you suddenly wake up to it and you go, &#8216;Wait a fucking second, are you&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;are you treating me different because I&#8217;ve got a pair of tits? Is that actually happening?&#8217;&quot; she says to Rolling Stone, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It took me a really long time to see that I do get treated differently. But I look around, and that&#8217;s my daily life.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke is aware she&#8217;s fortunate.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s aware that she was named <a href="/2015/10/emilia-clarke-named-sexiest-woman-alive/">Esquire&#8217;s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015</a> and that her looks have helped to further her career.</p>
<p>But she still has an important message to send:</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#8217;t stop me from being a feminist. Like, guess what?</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I&#8217;ve got mascara on, and I also have a high IQ, so those two things can be one and the same.&quot;</p>

<p>As Game of Thrones embarks on its final two seasons (yes, <em>EVER</em>!), Clarke&#8217;s character is finally setting sail for Westeros.</p>
<p>She is finally taking the climactic steps toward the Iron Throne, following many years of being one of the biggest female bad asses on television.</p>
<p>&quot;Women have been great rulers,&quot; she says of her role and the challenging world in which she&#8217;s acting these days.</p>
<p>&quot;And then for that to be a character that I&#8217;m known to play? That&#8217;s so f-cking lucky. Anyone who seems to think that it&#8217;s not needed need only look at the political environment we&#8217;re all living in to be like, &#8216;Oh, no, it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is needed.&quot;</p>
<p>It really is.</p>

<p>And while we do care a lot about feminism and politics and equality and strong women, we need to know from Clarke:</p>
<p>Can she reveal any <a href="/2017/06/game-of-thrones-season-7-spoilers-who-dies-whats-jon-snows-real/">Game of Thrones Season 7 spoilers</a>?</p>
<p>&quot;Spoiler alert &#8211; I normally don&#8217;t spend very much time in Belfast, but this last season I spent a little more time there,&quot; she teases.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s a really interesting season in terms of some loose ends that have been tied, some really satisfying plot points, some things where you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Oh, my God. I forgot about that!&#8217;</p>
<p>&quot;Rumors are going to be confirmed or denied.&quot;</p>
<p>One rumor going around if that a Game of Thrones spinoff (or <em>four</em> <a href="/2017/05/game-of-thrones-four-different-spinoffs-in-the-works/">Games of Thrones spinoffs</a>) is in the works.</p>
<p>This may be the case, but don&#8217;t expect to see Clarke as&nbsp;Daenerys Targaryes in any of them.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-1024x512.jpg" alt="Game of Thrones Hottie" class="wp-image-228841" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-768x384.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-735x368.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-335x168.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-347x174.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-520x260.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-640x320.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-960x480.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie-1080x540.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/game-of-thrones-hottie.jpg 1220w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(HBO)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;I am doing one more season. And then that&#8217;ll be it,&quot; she says to Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>We get it. We get that Clarke likely wants to spread her wings and try something else.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just going to miss Emilia Clarke,&nbsp;Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains&#8230; Talker &#8216;Bout Boobies. We&#8217;re gonna miss her a lot.</p>

<p>In a statement, Day-Lewis&rsquo; spokeswoman, Leslee Dart, <a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/daniel-day-lewis-quits-acting-oscar-winner-1202472766/">confirmed the news to Variety</a>, telling the Hollywood news outlet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.&quot;</p>
<p>No further statement and no other reasons for the star&#8217;s retirement were provided.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old star has already finished shooting &ldquo;Phantom Thread,&rdquo; a drama set in the world of high fashion that is scheduled to hit theaters on December 25, 2017.</p>
<p>It will reunite him with long-time collaborator Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>

<p>Anderson also directed Day-Lewis to a Best Actor Academy Award victory for 2007&rsquo;s &ldquo;There Will Be Blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to someone close to Day-Lewis, he does intend to help promote the movie later this year.</p>
<p>Day-Lewis has won a total of three Best Actor trophies; for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.</p>
<p>He garnered two other Academy Award nominations for Gangs of New York and In the Name of the Father and has long been known as one of true &quot;method&quot; actors in Hollywood.</p>
<p>That is, Day-Lewis typically continues to play his movie character even when the cameras stop rolling, continuing to act as Abraham Lincoln, for example, on set throughout the day.</p>
<p>His impressive resume is chock full of unique roles and movies, from Nine to The Last of the Mohicans to The Age of Innocence.</p>

<p>According to the same Variety article that confirmed his retirement, Day-Lewis learned Czech in order to portray a philandering doctor in The Unbearable Lightness of Being and listened to Eminem songs to channel rage in Gangs of New York.</p>
<p>Heck, he confined himself to a wheelchair for My Left Foot to play someone who suffered from cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>Day-Lewis has three children and is married to writer and director Rebecca Miller.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll miss him on the big screen.</p>

<p>But some folks out there are growing increasingly concerned about just what viewers are watching on The Eye these days.</p>
<p>Or, to be more specific, about just <em>WHO</em> viewers are watching.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>For the second year in a row, CBS presented a group of new shows at its Upfront Presentation in New York City this week that was lacking in two departments:</p>
<p>1. Diversity.</p>
<p>2. Boobs.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are six new dramas and sitcoms on the network&#8217;s 2017-2018 schedule and five are led by a white male, while the sixth is led by an African-American male.</p>
<p>The new programs and their top-billed stars are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		SEAL Team, David Boreanaz</li>
	<li>
		&nbsp;S.W.A.T., Shemar Moore</li>
	<li>
		Wisdom of the Crowd, Jeremy Piven</li>
	<li>
		9JKL, Mark Feuerstein</li>
	<li>
		Me, Myself &amp; I, Bobby Moynihan&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Young Sheldon, Iain Armitage</li>
</ul>
<p>What the heck, CBS? Where&#8217;s the diversity?!?</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, a reporter asked CBS President Les Moonves whether it was really a sound strategy to not have a single female lead among his new crop of programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw this with you guys last year,&rdquo; the reporter asked, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you concerned, particularly in a medium like television where women watch more than men, that you have such a male-centered [lineup]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>These were the faces at the forefront of CBS&#8217; new shows a year ago:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Replied Moonves:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, number one, more women watch CBS, percentage-wise, than any other network, so our shows have a lot of female appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever had to apologize for having Madam Secretary and Lucy Liu [on Elementary], and The Good Fight [on CBS All Access] and The Good Wife.</p>
<p>&quot;We do a number of pilots, a lot of them have women in starring roles. There are a lot of women on the schedule. The best pilots win at the end of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;And we think our track record is okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we said, CBS <em>is</em> the most-watched network on television.</p>
<p>So this issue begs the question of whether it has a social responsibility to be more diverse&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; or whether the viewing public should shoulder some blame because, hey, <em>they&#8217;re</em> the ones tuning in to CBS in droves. What&#8217;s a network to do when it&#8217;s obviously fulfilling its goals of putting appealing shows on the air?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="631" height="660" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs.jpg" alt="Jeremy Piven for CBS" class="wp-image-265322" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs.jpg 631w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs-287x300.jpg 287w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs-320x335.jpg 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs-332x347.jpg 332w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs-497x520.jpg 497w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/jeremy-piven-for-cbs-612x640.jpg 612w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /><figcaption>(CBS)</figcaption></figure>

<p>But this reporter pressed on.</p>
<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re at this point in the industry &mdash; FX, for example, is trying to make sure half its directors are female. It seems like you guys might be facing in the wrong direction?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case,&quot; Moonves&nbsp;shot back.</p>
<p>He then elaborated as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Let me put on my CEO hat for a second because I&rsquo;m not the president of entertainment. When I look at the totality of what CBS is, I look at news, I look at daytime, I look at sports, I look at Showtime, I look at The CW.</p>
<p>&quot;And when you look at the totality of that, I think we&rsquo;re fine in terms of the amount of women who are behind the camera and in front of the camera. I think we&rsquo;re doing a very good job.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re looking in the wrong direction, on the contrary.&quot;</p>

<p>What do you think of this controversy?</p>
<p>Is it much ado about nothing?</p>
<p>Does a television network have a social responsibility of some kind? Or do they actually have a responsibility to shareholders, which means they should only focus on programs that are popular&#8230; and no network does a better job of that than CBS.</p>
<p>Tough questions.</p>
<p>Discuss!</p>
