<p>Welp.</p>



<p>Gwyneth Paltrow just went there.</p>



<p>The Oscar-winning actress used her “Call Her Daddy” podcast appearance to spill some VERY personal tea on two VERY famous ex-boyfriends:</p>



<p>Ben Affleck and Brad Pitt.</p>

<p>“They were both good kissers,” the 52-year-old said when the topic turned to these past lovers&#8230; but host Alex Cooper wanted to learn more.</p>



<p>She asked Paltrow “who was better in bed,” and Paltrow actually answered!</p>



<p>Kind of. Sort of.</p>



<p>To at least <em>some</em> extent.</p>

<p> “That is really hard,&#8221; Paltrow responded, prior to delivering the following revealing response: </p>



<p>&#8220;Brad was, like, the sort of major chemistry, love of your life, kind of, at the time. And then Ben was, like, technically excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Interesting, right? Paltrow appears to be saying that Pitt wins in the passion department, but Affleck comes out on top in terms of technique.</p>



<p>&#8221; I can’t believe my daughter is listening to this! … Am I blushing?” Paltrow added on the podcast.</p>

<p>Paltrow and Pitt met on the set of Se7en in 1994 and got engaged in 1996.</p>



<p>After that relationship ended, the star moved on with Affleck, with whom she was romantically linked from 1997 to 2000.</p>



<p>“I’m not sure I would characterize either of them as high maintenance. … I’m not sure [who cared more about their appearance],&#8221; Paltrow also said on Tuesday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like neither of them are very vain like that. I’m not attracted to guys who are, like, looking at the mirror the whole time. </p>



<p>&#8220;Although, Ben did have, like, a mirror face that he would throw at the mirror. He had a funny mirror face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paltrow also struggled when asked who was better at his job.</p>



<p>“They’re both so talented. I feel like Ben is a great writer and director, but, I guess, I would probably have to say acting along Brad,” Paltrow responded. </p>



<p>“If you think of all the really different roles he’s done&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben is great too, they’re both great.”</p>

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow has exposed Nikki Glaser for trying to bang her ex.</p>



<p>And the best part of this story is that Nikki is not denying that she <em>repeatedly</em> reached out to Ben Affleck in an effort to score a spot in the Batfleck&#8217;s bed.</p>



<p>That surprising revelation came during the latest episode of Gwyneth&#8217;s podcast.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1249295174-1024x683.jpg" alt="Gwyneth Paltrow testifies during her trial, March 24, 2023, in Park City, Utah.

<p>During a conversation about the dating app Raya, Nikki surprised the Goop goddess by revealing her attempts to bang Ben. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nikki-glaser-says-she-was-rebuffed-by-ben-affleck">Nikki Glaser says she was rebuffed by Ben Affleck</h2>



<p>“When I used to be on Raya and he would come across, [I would give him a] very concentrated check mark ‘yes’ and, like, never [got] it back,” <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nikki-glaser-on-sex-shame-stand-up/id1352546554?i=1000700715708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glaser said</a>.</p>



<p>Gwyneth dated Ben way back in the &#8217;90s, so she obviously wasn&#8217;t upset about Nikki&#8217;s confession. In fact, she seemed to find the situation downright hilarious.</p>



<p>These days, Paltrow is in a serious relationship with producer Brad Falchuk, whom she&#8217;s been dating since 2018. For her part, Nikki has been in an on-again, off-again relationship with Chris Convy.</p>

<p>So she&#8217;s probably over the Affleck rejection (to the extent that one <em>can</em> get over such a thing). But Nikki still vividly recalls the many A-list dudes she encountered during her time on Raya.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-could-ve-had-a-glarfield-romance">We could&#8217;ve had a Glarfield romance</h2>



<p>&#8220;I think Andrew Garfield&#8217;s face came up for me so many times. Multiple times,&#8221; Glaser said.</p>



<p>&#8220;That would have been a good one. He&#8217;s gorgeous,&#8221; Paltrow replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he just didn&#8217;t see my profile, even though I clicked on his a [million times]. They&#8217;ll keep serving you up the same people, like, again and again for some reason,&#8221; Glaser added.</p>

<p>&#8220;So every time I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yes, Andrew Garfield, like, duh.&#8217; This is years and years ago. I don&#8217;t want to put anything out there, but, like, yes. Yes. Yes,&#8221; she further explained.</p>



<p>&#8220;And I know for a fact he had to have seen my profile and gone, &#8216;Nope,&#8217; because sometimes they send people that you keep saying no to? So, like, I would have matched with him if he was interested.&#8221;</p>



<p>These days, Garfield is rumored to be dating <em>A Complete Unknown</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/tom-cruise-new-girlfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monica Barbaro</a>.</p>

<p>Even though Gwyneth broke up with Ben and he denied Nikki&#8217;s advances, it seems that neither of then harbors any ill will toward the Oscar winner.</p>



<p>Though Gwyneth killed off her ex and Shakespeare In Love costar during a game of &#8220;F&#8211;k, Marry, Kill,&#8221; she also described him as &#8220;excellent&#8221; in bed during a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/26/celebrity-news/gwyneth-paltrow-nikki-glaser-wanted-to-f-k-ex-ben-affleck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent interview</a>.</p>



<p>As for Nikki, she recently revealed to Howard Stern that she cut a joke about Ben out of her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/nikki-glaser-expects-to-be-canceled-after-hosting-golden-globes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globes monologue</a>.</p>



<p>“‘Here’s to Ben Affleck. I can’t wait to see which Jennifer you try to ruin next.’ … That would have been insane,” she told Stern.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Ben appreciates that she decided not to go that route!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been over two months since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-finalized-who-got-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez finalized their divorce</a>. </p>



<p>And now, for the first time, Ben is telling his side of the story.</p>



<p>The Oscar-winner covers the April issue of <em>GQ</em>, and inside the mag he gives his most candid interview yet on the topic of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-betrayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024&#8217;s most high-profile split</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-affleck-downplays-drama-says-he-still-respects-his-ex">Ben Affleck downplays drama, says he still respects his ex</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/inside-ben-afflecks-plan-to-remake-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asked about the breakup</a>, Ben characterized the whole thing as “drama-free.”</p>



<p>He then insisted that fans’ “eyes would glaze over with boredom” if they “sat down and talked to” him about his seemingly “sensational” life.</p>



<p>Ben declined to go into detail about the reasons behind the split, but he allowed that he&#8217;s “more reserved and private than” Lopez, and he acknowledged that they did not “always have the same attitude toward” being in the public eye.</p>



<p>Ben also addressed the topic of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-tracker-their-house-is-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jen&#8217;s controversial documentary</a>, <em>The Greatest Love Story Never Told</em>. He denied that the film caused “some major fracture” in the relationship.</p>



<p>But he subtly acknowledged that it wasn&#8217;t exactly his dream project, explaining that he took part in order to show “love and support” to his then-partner.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to own what you knew going into any relationship,” he noted. </p>



<p>“It’s not like you can watch that documentary and go, ‘Oh, now I understand the issues that these two had.&#8217;”</p>



<p>Ben went on to say that despite the brevity of their marriage, Jen remains “somebody [he has] a lot of respect for.”</p>



<p>He further explained that he does not want to “suggest” that “the line between public and private life” led to “negativity or judgment.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-sings-jen-s-praises">Ben sings Jen&#8217;s praises </h2>



<p>“I have nothing but respect [for her]. I guess there’s a tendency to look at breakups and want to identify root causes or something. But honestly, like I said, the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting,&#8221; Affleck continued.</p>



<p>He added that there was “no scandal, no soap opera [and] no intrigue&#8221; during the marriage or ensuing divorce.</p>



<p>“The truth is, when you talk to somebody, ‘Hey, what happened?’ Well, there is no: ‘This is what happened.’ It’s just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>“There is no ‘So-and-so did this’ or ‘This was the big event,&#8217;” Affleck continued. </p>

<p>“It sounds more like a couple’s therapy session. … You start going, ‘OK, clearly this person has got these issues. Clearly, they have these issues.&#8217;”</p>



<p>Ben added that he has no interest in sharing details about the split, as doing so would be “sort of embarrassing” and “vulnerable.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure Jen will follow suit. After all, these two have weathered enough controversies over the course of their careers &#8212; we&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re not looking to welcome any additional, unnecessary drama into their lives.</p>

<p>As we previously reported, a photo of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-spark-reconciliation-rumors-after-embracing-in-public/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner embracing in public</a> made quite a stir on social media last week.</p>



<p>The pic showed Ben wrapping his arms around Jen&#8217;s waist during a paintball game involving their teenage son.</p>



<p>There was no drama on Ben&#8217;s side, as he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-finalized-who-got-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized his divorce from Jennifer Lopez</a> back in January.</p>



<p>But Garner? Well, she&#8217;s in a committed long-term relationship &#8212; and it seems her boyfriend was not thrilled about what he saw.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jennifer-garner-s-boyfriend-reportedly-issues-ultimatum">Jennifer Garner&#8217;s boyfriend reportedly issues ultimatum</h2>



<p>Jen has been dating CaliBurger CEO John Miller off and on since 2018.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/11/celebrity-news/jennifer-garners-boyfriend-john-miller-issues-ultimatum-after-ben-affleck-crossed-the-line-in-cozy-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, Miller was not pleased with the paintball pic. An insider says he “has always been supportive of Ben and Jen’s co-parenting relationship but feels Ben crossed the line&#8221; in the photo.</p>



<p>“John knows there’s nothing going on between Jen and Ben, but he doesn’t think those photos are a good look and feels it’s disrespectful to their relationship,&#8221; says the source.</p>



<p>The insider adds that John “gave Jen an ultimatum,&#8221; explaining that “he doesn’t want to see anything like that again or he has no choice but to walk away.”</p>

<p>Page Six reports that Garner &#8220;seemed to welcome the embrace&#8221; from Ben, but it&#8217;s tough to tell, as they were both wearing protective paintball masks at the time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that there have been reports of Miller&#8217;s discomfort with Affleck and Garner&#8217;s close friendship.</p>



<p>A different insider previously told Page Six that John “knows Ben and Jen have been leaning on each other more than ever lately and have a really close relationship&#8221; &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s comfortable with it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-john-miller-to-jennifer-garner-three-s-a-crowd">John Miller to Jennifer Garner: Three&#8217;s a crowd!</h2>



<p>“Their growing bond is getting to be a bit much when Ben spends all the holidays with them like Christmas and Thanksgiving,” the second said, adding:</p>

<p>“John feels like a third wheel.”</p>



<p>And it seems that John isn&#8217;t the only one who finds Jen and Ben&#8217;s relationship a tad inappropriate.</p>



<p>They might not be together anymore, but it seems that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-betrayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez feels &#8220;betrayed&#8221;</a> by Ben&#8217;s handsy behavior toward his ex.</p>



<p>“[JLo] saw the paintballing images when the rest of the world did,” an inside source told <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14466097/Jennifer-Lopez-betrayed-Ben-Affleck-Garner-video-sexy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Mail</a></em>.</p>

<p>“And of course it will make her question things from their time together,” the insider continued.</p>



<p>The source added: “Her friends have questioned how platonic Jen [Garner] and Ben are.”</p>



<p>If we had to guess, we would say that Ben and Jen are friendly co-parents who share a tremendous amount of history together and enjoy a close, but very platonic relationship.</p>



<p>That said, we can totally see why Jen&#8217;s current partner might be a little weirded out by that pic.</p>

<p>Jennifer Lopez is reportedly fuming over Ben Affleck in the wake of their split.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just post-breakup bitterness. She apparently feels &#8220;betrayed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cozy glimpses of her recent ex-husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-spark-reconciliation-rumors-after-embracing-in-public/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Jennifer Garner</a> made the rounds, inciting jokes and praise alike.</p>



<p>Lopez saw them, too. And it sounds like she&#8217;s <em>not </em>happy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yes-jennifer-lopez-saw-ben-affleck-being-so-cozy-with-the-other-jen">Yes, Jennifer Lopez saw Ben Affleck being so cozy with the other Jen</h2>



<p>According to a new report, Jennifer Lopez is reeling from Ben Affleck&#8217;s recent cozy photos with his <em>other </em>famous A-list Jennifer ex-wife, Jennifer Garner.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner went on a recent outing with their shared children.</p>



<p>However, a video captured the two embracing. Seeing her ex with his other ex reportedly stirred up doubts and more in Jennifer Lopez, despite their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-finalized-who-got-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized divorce</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perhaps-jennifer-lopez-feels-like-she-put-a-lot-of-work-into-ben-affleck-only-for-another-ex-to-scoop-him-up">Perhaps Jennifer Lopez feels like she put a lot of work into Ben Affleck, only for another ex to scoop him up?</h2>



<p>&#8220;She will feel betrayed,&#8221; the insider then claimed about Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Garner.</p>



<p>This, the source explained, is &#8220;because she invested so much time in supporting Ben through his challenges.&#8221;</p>



<p>The insider added that Lopez did all of that &#8220;and had a rough year as their marriage broke down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The report goes on to allege that Jennifer Lopez has a sinking feeling about some of her concerns that she allegedly felt during their marriage. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were close, Lopez observed, due to their shared kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seeing how quickly he has started spending more time with Garner has exacerbated the concerns she already had,&#8221; the insider claimed.</p>



<p>The source explained that these were concerns that Lopez felt &#8220;about his relationship with her while they were married.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-that-mean-that-there-was-cheating">Does that mean that there was cheating?</h2>



<p>Some exes hate each other. Other exes get along well as friends. Either can describe exes who went through a famous divorce and share kids. Yes, even when one of them got a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/03/ben-affleck-lied-about-his-fake-back-tattoo-and-now-hes-getting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very silly back tattoo</a> in the aftermath.</p>



<p>If they seem cozy with each other years after they split, when both of them are single &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that they&#8217;re getting back together.</p>



<p>Could they? Sure. Jennifer Garner could put herself through that again. But Ben Affleck may have to find another Jennifer (not Lopez or Garner) this time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been almost seven years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner ended their marriage.</p>



<p>But the former couple is making headlines again this week, thanks to rumors that they might be considering a reconciliation.</p>



<p>The speculation started, of all places, on a paintball field.</p>



<p>Ben and Jen were competing alongside their 13-year-old son Ben (they also have two daughters together).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-and-jen-pack-on-the-pda-while-playing-paintball">Ben and Jen pack on the PDA while playing paintball</h2>



<p>At one point during the battle, Ben playfully hugged Jen around the waist.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/04/celebrity-news/ben-affleck-affectionately-holds-ex-wife-jennifer-garner-during-paintball-outing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, Garner &#8220;seemed to welcome&#8221; the embrace. It&#8217;s not the first indication that the exes enjoy a very close relationship.</p>



<p>One source tells the outlet that Affleck and Garner have “found themselves leaning on each other more than ever&#8221; in recent years.</p>



<p>“They really do have a close bond,” the insider added.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-would-jen-be-willing-to-give-ben-a-second-chance">Would Jen be willing to give Ben a second chance?</h2>



<p>But does that mean that the exes would be willing to give their marriage another shot?</p>



<p>Well, a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/04/celebrity-news/ben-affleck-would-love-another-chance-with-ex-jennifer-garner-if-timing-is-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different insider</a> tells Page Six that Ben “would love another chance” Jennifer Garner.</p>



<p> The source says that “would definitely be open to giving things another shot with Jen if the timing is ever right.&#8221; But currently, the timing seems not to be right.</p>



<p>“At the same time, Ben knows it’s just not realistic at this time in their lives,&#8221; the insider adds.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-and-jen-s-complex-situation-explained">Ben and Jen&#8217;s complex situation, explained</h2>



<p>These days, Ben is single, having<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-divorce-finalized-who-got-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finalized his divorce from Jennifer Lopez</a> last year.</p>



<p>Jen is in currently an &#8220;on-off&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-garner-boyfriend-on-a-break-amid-ben-affleck-divorce-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">romance with businessman John Miller</a>. However, a source tells Page Six that Miller is unhappy about her “close relationship” with Affleck.</p>



<p>“John feels like a third wheel,” says the insider.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="583" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-162638046-583x1024.jpg" alt="Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck, winner of the Best Picture award for 'Argo' arrive at the 2013 Governors Ball on February 24, 2013 in Hollywood, California.

<p>But despite the rumors of friction, it seems that Jen and John are still very much together, and a reconciliation with Ben is simply not in the cards right now.</p>



<p>“Ben just got out of a marriage and finalized his divorce [from Jennifer Lopez], he is really busy with work and is focused on this new chapter,” the source explains.</p>



<p>“Plus, Ben respects Jen’s relationship with John [Miller] and would never come between them.”</p>



<p>Another insider tells Page Six, “The feeling is not mutual on Jen’s side. She’s happy with John and that’s just not where her head is at. She has a great co-parenting relationship with Ben, and that’s where things stand on her end at the moment.”</p>



<p>So it seems that Ben will have to content himself with a close friendship. Probably for the best. He should try dating someone who&#8217;s not named Jen for a change.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t need to tell you that these are very tense times in the Los Angeles area.</p>



<p>Devastating wildfires have ravaged the area causing dozens of deaths and the destruction of thousands of homes and businesses.</p>



<p>Countless celebrities have had to evacuate, including <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/ben-affleck-evacuates-abandons-20-5-million-mansion-amid-palisades-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck, who was forced to abandon the $20.5 million mansion </a>that he just purchased last year.</p>



<p>Ben has since been able to return to his home, but it seems that life has not yet gone back to normal for the Oscar winner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ben-affleck-receives-visits-from-federal-law-enforcement-agents">Ben Affleck Receives Visits From Federal Law Enforcement Agents</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Affleck received a visit from the FBI.</p>



<p>That sounds scary, but the agency has since made it clear that Ben wasn&#8217;t in any sort of trouble.</p>



<p>The FBI tells <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/01/15/celebrity-news/ben-affleck-has-heated-conversation-with-cops-after-fbi-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that the visit had to do with an investigation into “activity in the area of the Palisades Fire relative to unauthorized drone activity.”</p>

<p>These fires and the devastation they&#8217;ve wrought are unprecedented, so it makes sense that the authorities are keeping an eye on Los Angeles County like never before.</p>



<p>“FBI agents were at Affleck’s home to see if he had CCTV footage of a private drone which damaged a super scooper, one of the firefighting aircraft,&#8221; a source told the outlet.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know what sort of conversation took place between Ben and the FBI. But based on <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/01/13/celebrity-news/why-ben-affleck-got-a-visit-from-fbi-agents-and-la-cops-at-brentwood-bachelor-pad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">photos from the encounter</a>, their exchange appeared to be a peaceful one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the situation might have gotten a bit tense when Ben had a run-in with the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>



<p>According to Page Six, the cops were also &#8220;assisting with a grid search for unauthorized drones” in the area.</p>



<p>The outlet reports that Ben appeared &#8220;visibly frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;very animated&#8221; as he exchanged words with two officers in a police cruiser.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="694" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-613834908-1024x694.jpg" alt="Actor Ben Affleck attends the premiere of Warner Bros Pictures' &quot;The Accountant&quot; at TCL Chinese Theatre on October 10, 2016 in Hollywood, California.

<p>The increased police presence in the area was reportedly the result of both the drone situation and claims that private security forces hired by Ben&#8217;s neighbors were preventing people from returning to their homes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear how Ben got wrapped up in that scenario, but Page Six reports that he was &#8220;eventually able to go to his residence&#8221; after conversing with police.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trying-times">Trying Times</h2>



<p>These are tough times for the residents of LA County, and we&#8217;re sure quite a few tense conversations have taken place in the past week.</p>

<p>But a source close to Ben assures fans that the 52-year-old feels fortunate that his home was left unscathed, and he&#8217;s now focused on helping those who weren&#8217;t so lucky.</p>





<p>“Ben knows many people who unfortunately lost their homes,” the insider tells Page Six. </p>



<p>“He has seen a lot of devastation, and it’s beyond tragic. … Ben is reaching out to anybody he can to help.”</p>



<p>Our thoughts remain with those who have been impacted by this devastating disaster.</p>

<p>As devastating wildfires continue to ravage Southern California, more than 30,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes.</p>



<p>The area is home to countless celebrities, many of whom have been profoundly impacted by this historic disaster.</p>



<p>One such star is Ben Affleck, who was forced to abandon the $20.5 million Pacific Palisades mansion that he purchased just five months ago.</p>

<p>The outlet also reports that Affleck headed straight to the home of his first wife, Jennifer Garner, who lives her and Ben&#8217;s three kids, Violet, 19, Seraphina, 16, and Samuel, 12. </p>



<p>According to Page Six, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/01/08/celebrity-news/ben-affleck-flees-to-jennifer-garners-home-amid-palisades-fire/">Garner lives</a> &#8220;who live a short distance from&#8221; Affleck, but in an area that has not yet been affected by the fires.</p>

<p>The fires began Tuesday morning, and sadly, they&#8217;re still a long from being contained.</p>



<p>High wind warnings continue through this evening, and it&#8217;s too early to even begin calculating the damage. The Los Angeles Times reports that at least five people have been killed and more than 1,000 homes and businesses destroyed.</p>



<p>And of course, Ben is far from the only celebrity who&#8217;s been impacted by the disaster.</p>

<p>Numerous other stars have been devastated by this week&#8217;s fires, including James Woods and Anna Faris, both of whose houses were destroyed by the flames.</p>



<p>Reality star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/spencer-pratt-watches-house-burn-down-amid-los-angeles-wildfires/">Spencer Pratt documented the destruction of his mansion</a> on social media, while <em>All My Children </em>actor Cameron Mathison shared the tragic loss of the house he hoped to pass down to his kids.</p>



<p>“We are safe. But this is what’s left of our beautiful home,” Mathison wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEkkT_Evt6l/?hl=en">Instagram</a> today. “Our home where our kids were raised and where they wanted to raise their own someday.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>It is, officially, all over between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.</p>



<p>The famous former spouses formally ended their marriage on Monday, January 6, according to documents obtained by various celebrity gossip and entertainment news outlets. </p>



<p>In doing so, both parties “agreed to divide all assets and liabilities” to avoid further litigation and expense.</p>



<p>Lopez, if you&#8217;ll recall, initiated this process back in August when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-files-to-divorce-ben-affleck-its-finally-over/">she filed to divorce Affleck</a> after two years as husband and wife.</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="894" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-1024x894.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-516130" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-1024x894.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-300x262.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-768x670.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-2048x1788.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-960x838.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-1080x943.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1834600107-1200x1047.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez attend ELLE&#8217;s 2023 Women in Hollywood Celebration Presented by Ralph Lauren, Harry Winston and Viarae at Nya Studios on December 5, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for ELLE )</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Considering the combined wealth between these stars, this was a relatively clean, simple and amicable settlement.</p>



<p>Lopez, for example, keeps all of her personal belongings and earnings from their date of separation (listed as April 26, 2024), as well as half of the ex-couple&#8217;s shared bank accounts. </p>



<p>Affleck receives the same. </p>



<p>The actor also keeps his role and share in the production company Artists Equity, which he cofounded in November 2022 with best friend Matt Damon.</p>



<p>Per the agreement, Affleck and Lopez will divide their $60 million mansion in Beverly Hills that is now on the market.</p>

<p>In the divorce, Lopez retains her clothing, jewelry and “miscellaneous personal effects in her possession, custody or control,” and all assets that she owns “individually or by entities of which [Lopez] is the sole owner, member or shareholder.”</p>



<p>Having relied on mediation in September to come up with most of these terms, Lopez also requested to drop “Affleck” from her last name and restore her legal name to <em>Jennifer Lynn Lopez</em>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-reason/">Lopez-Affleck divorce</a> had been rumored for several weeks prior to the singer/actress finally making it a done deal this past summer.</p>



<p>The celebrities, of course, had first gotten together &#8212; and even gotten engaged &#8212; in the early 200s&#8230; only to break up&#8230; date and marry other people&#8230; get back together in May 2021&#8230; and then exchange vows in April 2022.</p>



<p>Now, at last, it appears as if their romantic journey has come to an end. We presume, at least.</p>

<p>About three months ago, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jennifer-lopez-finally-breaks-silence-on-ben-affleck-divorce/">Lopez broke her silence</a> on the end of this romance &#8212; although she didn&#8217;t cite Affleck by name or delve into any specifics.</p>



<p>“You have to be complete, if you want something that’s more complete,” Lopez told comedian Nikki Glaser in October, adding:</p>



<p>“You have to be good on your own. I thought I learned that, but I didn’t. And then, this summer, I had to be like, ‘I need to go off and be on my own. I want to prove to myself that I can do that&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;With everything that’s happened in my life and in my relationships and even in my career, it’s like, give yourself a bit of comfort and love.</p>



<p>“We’ve been through a lot of things that nobody knows about, and you’ve persevered and you refuse to give up and to let it get you down.”</p>

<p>Lopez was previously married to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998; Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003; and Marc Anthony 2004 to 2014. She shares twins Max and Emme with the latter. </p>



<p>Affleck, for his part, was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018.</p>



<p>They coparent their three kids, Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.</p>

<p>As an actress, however?</p>



<p>On November 3, Affleck say alongside Matt Damon for a video interview with Entertainment Tonight during which he was asked about the upcoming film Unstoppable, which Affleck produced and <em>in</em> which Lopez stars.</p>



<p>&#8220;Upstoppable is &#8230; rooted in the passion of really talented artists. [Director] Billy Goldenberg and Jennifer [Lopez] and Don Cheadle and Jharrel [Jerome], and Bobby Cannavale, all were really passionate about this film,&#8221; he responded.</p>



<p>Expounding on the stars of the movie, Affleck pointed out their emotional connection to the story, noting that, “Jennifer is spectacular.”</p>

<p>Affleck hasn&#8217;t said anything in public about the divorce.</p>



<p>Lopez, however, recently acknowledged the pair’s failed romance during an interview with Nikki Glaser for Interview magazine that was published on October 9.</p>



<p>“I think my whole life I’ve just been trying to say I’m good enough, until where I am now, when I know. I’m giving myself credit,&#8221; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/jennifer-lopez-finally-breaks-silence-on-ben-affleck-divorce/">said the star in a candid moment</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m telling that little girl that grew up in the Bronx, ‘You’ve done really good for yourself.’ I didn’t do that for so many years.</p>



<p>&#8220;And now I think, with everything that’s happened in my life and in my relationships and even in my career, it’s like, give yourself a bit of comfort and love. We’ve been through a lot of things that nobody knows about, and you’ve persevered and you refuse to give up and to let it get you down.”</p>

<p>Lopez did not cite Affleck by name in this discussion.</p>



<p>But she added at the time: </p>



<p>“There’s something to be said for that because things can really change your life in a way that you do want to give up and say, &#8216;F-ck this, this is too hard, I don’t want to do this anymore.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I’m not there. I refuse to not give myself everything that little girl deserves.”</p>

<p>The estranged spouses exchanged vows in front of friends and family in Georgia in August 2022 after quietly getting married in Las Vegas one month.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-reunite-hold-hands-kiss/">scant talk of reconciliation</a> between the two, but that now seems VERY unlikely.</p>



<p>The celebrities reportedly remain friendly amid their current situation, however. </p>



<p>“There’s still a lot of love between them,” an Us Weekly insider said this summer.</p>
