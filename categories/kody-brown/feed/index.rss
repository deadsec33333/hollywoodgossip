<p>Kody Brown is lamenting the one who got away.</p>



<p>Kind of. Sort of.</p>



<p>In his own vague and sort of confusing way, that is.</p>



<p>The narcissistic Sister Wives patriarch sat down for an interview with TLC that the network shared via Instagram on February 8&#8230; during which he sat back and took a long view of his three former spouses.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-10-at-10.41.02%E2%80%AFAM-909x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-518896"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is interviewed here by TLC.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I kind of look at Meri still as a friend,” the 55-year old began in this footage. “I’m sure both of us, mutually, will get back to that place. I have hope that Meri and I would be friends.”</p>



<p>This stance shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to loyal Sister Wives fans.</p>



<p>Yes, Kody and Meri terminated their marriage two years ago.</p>



<p>But the latter has made it clear ever since that she harbors no ill will toward the former, and even thanked Kody for all the joy he brought into her life <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/meri-brown-reveals-break-up-text-to-kody-thank-you-for-many-years-of-joy/\">via a text message</a> right around the time of their split.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Kody-Brown-091324-1-13117bab357b478abe3677d8fa14c0b9.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-516665" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Kody-Brown-091324-1-13117bab357b478abe3677d8fa14c0b9.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Kody-Brown-091324-1-13117bab357b478abe3677d8fa14c0b9-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown never really looks to happy, does he?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The dad of 18 then moved on as follows: </p>



<p>“I hear about Christine falling in love and getting married and stuff like this, and I’m, like, going, ‘Well, good on Christine.’&#8221;</p>



<p>This doesn&#8217;t come as a shocker, either.</p>



<p>Christine was the first sister wife to walk away from Kody &#8212; doing so in November 2021 and then marrying David Woolley in October 2023 &#8212; and has said in many instances that she could not be more done with Kody.</p>



<p>Heck, she&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/christine-brown-teases-gritty-honest-memoir-order-it-now-sister-wives-fans/">about to come out with a memoir</a> that delves into this topic even more.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="702" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/rs_1024x706-241031080052-Screenshot_2024-10-31_105652-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-512639" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/rs_1024x706-241031080052-Screenshot_2024-10-31_105652-copy.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/rs_1024x706-241031080052-Screenshot_2024-10-31_105652-copy-300x263.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/rs_1024x706-241031080052-Screenshot_2024-10-31_105652-copy-768x674.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown looks so very confused in this photo.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The polarizing reality star, however, softened a whole lot when the topic turned to Janelle Brown.</p>



<p>He told the camera that she represented &#8220;a different story,&#8221; adding &#8220;I always thought … I just felt like Janelle and I could have worked it out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle ended her spiritual union to Kody in early 2022, but never issued any sharp public statement about what transpired.</p>



<p>She simply acknowledged on air that she and Kody were &#8220;separated.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the latest Sister Wives episode, Kody spoke about Meri’s decision to ask the church for a “<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kody-brown-janelle-spiritual-divorce/">spiritual release</a>” from her marriage and said that he felt like he and Janelle had a different relationship.</p>



<p>“I didn’t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Meri, and I didn’t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Christine,” Kody told producers during a one-on-one interview. </p>



<p>“I don’t know if there’s some kind of karmic connection that Janelle and I are obligated to still.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle clearly doesn&#8217;t see it this way, though.</p>



<p>“I know Meri has just recently gotten a release like what we call a release, which is a divorce. And it’s made me think, ‘Huh, I kind of like the idea of getting a spiritual release.’ But I don’t even know who to call,” Janelle said on the same installment.</p>

<p>No matter how many times <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/janelle-brown-trashes-ex-says-kody-totally-wasted-family-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle trashes Kody</a>, she&#8217;s still stuck with her ties to him. </p>



<p>Those ties can take the form of regrets, her beloved children, or &#8230; their spiritual marriage.</p>



<p>The marriage is over. But after Meri sought an official spiritual divorce, Janelle wonders if she should do the same.</p>



<p>She has opinions on the topic. So does Christine. And neither of these <em>Sister Wives</em> stars sees eye-to-eye with Robyn on the matter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christine-and-janelle-discuss-what-it-means-to-be-done-with-kody-brown">Christine and Janelle discuss what it means to be done with Kody Brown</h2>



<p>On the Sunday, February 2 episode of <em>Sister Wives</em>, Janelle Brown set off on her cross-country trip. Having bought land in North Carolina, she was finally ready to make her move. And to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/janelle-brown-im-moving-on-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move on</a>.</p>



<p>She did not go alone. Christine Brown and her husband, David Woolley, accompanied her on the drive across all of the way from Mountain Time to <s>normal</s> East Coast time.</p>



<p>On their journey, Christine and Janelle discussed their ended marriages to Kody Brown. In addition to debating the significance of spiritual divorce, they also discussed Meri&#8217;s similar split from their mutual ex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;I wish Meri well,&#8221; Janelle Brown expressed. She aspired: &#8220;I really do hope, like, I really want all the good things for her because I feel like she&#8217;s been through the wringer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though Kody put Christine and Janelle <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/christine-brown-tell-all-confirmed-how-concerned-should-kody-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through so much</a> during their erstwhile plural marriage, Meri seemed to be having a rough time long before this.</p>



<p>Christine then affirmed: &#8220;I hope she can get in a loving relationship.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-janelle-get-a-spiritual-release-from-kody-like-meri-did">Should Janelle get a &#8216;spiritual release&#8217; from Kody like Meri did?</h2>



<p>Though all three women were married to Kody, only his marriage to Meri had any legal recognition. That ended when they two obtained a legal &#8212; but not spiritual &#8212; divorce so that he could marry Robyn and adopt her children.</p>



<p>Meri received a spiritual release from the marriage through the Brown family&#8217;s former church. And Janelle wondered if she should follow in her footsteps.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know Meri has just recently gotten a release like what we call a release, which is a divorce. And it&#8217;s made me think, &#8216;Huh, I kind of like the idea of getting a spiritual release,'&#8221; Janelle told the confessional camera. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t even know who to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>During his own confessional, Kody took a brief break from whining about his shattered Coyote Pass dreams to discuss conscious uncoupling from Janelle.</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Meri, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a spiritual divorce from Christine,&#8221; the reality TV villain listed.</p>



<p>Kody then continued: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s some kind of karmic connection that Janelle and I are obligated to still.&#8221;</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0">When faced with Robyn&#8217;s explanation that a spiritual release isn&#8217;t final until an ex-wife sleeps with a new man, Janelle commented: &#8220;I just think that&#8217;s bulls&#8211;t, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle continued: &#8220;I mean, I think that&#8217;s dogmatic. That&#8217;s a dogma I used to hear and I used to be like, &#8216;OK, whatever.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Simply put, she didn&#8217;t want to have sex just to finalize a spiritual divorce. And Christine gave a tongue-in-cheek: &#8220;Go have sex with somebody, then that marriage is over. You can move on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kody Brown has moved past the denial stage.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of Sister Wives, the family patriarch was chopping down trees on his Arizona property when he stopped to reflect what life is like now that he&#8217;s a monogamist.</p>



<p>(Not by choice, of course; Christine, Janelle and Meri Brown have all left Kody over the past couple years.)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Kody-Brown-091324-1-13117bab357b478abe3677d8fa14c0b9.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-516665" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Kody-Brown-091324-1-13117bab357b478abe3677d8fa14c0b9.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/Kody-Brown-091324-1-13117bab357b478abe3677d8fa14c0b9-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown never really looks to happy, does he?<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s a new rule that Robyn made and because I&#8217;m a monogamist, my wife gets to make rules, right?&#8221; Kody said, oozing with sarcasm. &#8220;So she&#8217;s like, &#8216;Don&#8217;t drop a tree until you&#8217;ve removed the last tree you dropped.'&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s rather evident Kody isn&#8217;t a fan of his brand new situation, despite recently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kody-brown-proposes-to-robyn-will-you-be-my-only-wife/">sort of proposing to Robyn</a> once again.</p>



<p>Impressively, however, Brown <em>did</em> sound like he&#8217;s a fan of Christine having moved on with husband <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a>, whose wedding was recently featured on Sister Wives because the show was filmed quite a long time ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited for her. I&#8217;ve only met David once, and everything that I can gather is, it&#8217;s moved pretty fast, but sometimes you just know,&#8221; Kody said on air Sunday night.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope they&#8217;re happy. And I hope someday the time comes where we&#8217;re just comfortable being around each other.&#8221;</p>



<p>That day has not yet arrived&#8230; considering the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/christine-brown-vs-kody-brown-sister-wives-stars-to-square-off-in-court/">exes will soon square off in court</a>.</p>



<p>Kody even acknowledged on this episode noted that that Christine &#8220;left with a purpose&#8221; as she &#8220;wanted to find her soul mate&#8221; and his main response took the form of <em>kudos</em>.</p>

<p>Following his trio of semi-recent break-ups, Kody said there is now &#8220;a lot of water under the bridge and it wasn&#8217;t all bad&#8221; when it comes to the women who are no longer with him.</p>



<p>Yes, it&#8217;s been &#8220;tough,&#8221; he added, because polygamy was &#8220;mostly good,&#8221; but the focus going forward is squarely on Robyn and their kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s a real different world, the world that I have with Robyn and our children. It&#8217;s kind, it&#8217;s pleasant, it&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s small,&#8221; Brown said in a confessional, showing some self-awareness by adding: </p>



<p>&#8220;I got to admit this. I think I need a lot of attention. It&#8217;s been different to be in a place where I don&#8217;t get as much attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>As previously documented, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-to-kody-dude-your-family-hates-you/">Kody isn&#8217;t close to most</a> of his sons and daughters.</p>



<p>He seems to think this is due to their disdain for Robyn.</p>



<p>&#8220;My children will always be my children and the door will always be open to them. They&#8217;ve got to come through that door,&#8221; he said, coming across like a pompous a$$. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be holding a hand out for that, but I&#8217;m going to be holding this hand that&#8217;s next to me, and I won&#8217;t let go of that hand. I will not cut off Robyn to have a relationship with my children.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier on Season 19, Janelle stressed that Kody&#8217;s marriage to Robyn was NOT the reason he&#8217;s estranged from his kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kody has this idea that somehow if he leaves Robyn home, he&#8217;s going to be able to come to these family gatherings. And that&#8217;s so far from the truth,&#8221; she said on an episode that aired in early December.</p>



<p>Janelle said back then that her ex is &#8220;alienated from 90 to 95 percent of his children. He is not really wanted at events. He is not coming regardless of who he brings or doesn&#8217;t bring with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Life has come at Kody Brown pretty fast over the last few years.</p>



<p>The former polygamous has been forced to accept a new reality: That he&#8217;s no longer a polygamist.</p>



<p>Starting in November 2021, Christine Brown, Janelle Brown and Meri Brown have <em>all</em> decided to leave their unhealthy relationships to Kody.</p>



<p>And now? In response to such romantic turmoil?</p>

<p>Kody may leave the country.</p>



<p>“I got an itch to move so bad, just to get away from the energy of it all,” Kody said in a confessional on the latest <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kody-brown-proposes-to-robyn-will-you-be-my-only-wife/">episode of Sister Wives</a>.</p>



<p>Kody made this admission in the wake of scene that featured him sitting outside with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/robyn-brown/">Robyn Brown</a>&#8230; as the two engaged in a challenging conversation about the current state of their marriage, along with how Kody feels due to his other three spouses leaving him.</p>



<p>“I got to get out of here because this isn&#8217;t going to work for me, because all the memory, all the energy of it, I just don&#8217;t know,” Kody continuesd. </p>



<p>“And here’s the stupid thing. I&#8217;ve got kids in college, kids in grade school — but I want to move to Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kody, of course, has 18 kids with the four women listed here.</p>



<p>But he&#8217;s never exactly been known as a dedicated parent.</p>



<p>“I want to get away from this where I can&#8217;t see it or be bombarded by it or feel it anymore,” concluded the selfish father on the topic of moving across the ocean.</p>



<p>Brown went on to explain to Robyn how he’s in a pretty awful with his exes, especially Janelle, who he says, “wants to do things different than what I want to do.”</p>



<p>“We’re just not matching up,” he said of his ex, who confirmed the couple&#8217;s separation just over two years ago.</p>

<p>On previous Sister Wives episodes on Season 19, Janelle had been candid about needing to “protect herself” and her desire to “lawyer up” after Kody kept her in the dark about the status of their shared Coyote Pass property in Flagstaff, Arizona.</p>



<p>Meri, meanwhile, recently complained <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/meri-brown-to-kody-stop-looking-at-me-naked/">about Kody invading her privacy</a>.</p>



<p>And Christine, for her part, is now married to David Woolley. She could not be happier that she got the heck away from Kody Brown.</p>

<p>In an interview with People Magazine in September 2024, Kody opened up about how he handled things when it came to how he handled the splits with these former wives.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s even the regret of the divorce — Meri, Janelle and Christine — those divorces and being angry during those divorces,” he said at the time. “Sure, I regret that stuff.”</p>

<p>Kody Brown just spilled some scalding hot, sexual tea.</p>



<p>About himself.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of Sister Wives, aside from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/kody-brown-proposes-to-robyn-will-you-be-my-only-wife/">asking Robyn Brown to be his only wife</a>, the father of 17 got more candid and more personal than usual.</p>

<p>“You want to know the craziest thing?” the 55-year old asked viewers during the January 5 installment of the TLC program. “I had a lover in college, and it was a little tryst.”</p>



<p>What made this a big and even a troubling deal?</p>



<p>“I had a relationship in college where I lost my virginity,&#8221; Kody continued, describing himself as a &#8220;a naughty boy based on my faith&#8221; and adding:</p>



<p>“It was devastating to me. It was heartbreaking.”</p>

<p>Kody, of course, was raised as a conservative Mormon, which led him to eventually live a polygamous existence &#8212; until, that is, Christine, Janelle and Meri ALL walked away from the reality star.</p>



<p>In this latest confessional, however, Brown explained that “purity” was “everything” in his childhood church, meaning that sex out of wedlock really messed with his psyche. </p>



<p>“It’s like you’re working your way back for it,” he told the cameras, emphasizing once again: “It is devastating.”</p>



<p>Kody also said on this episode that “nobody knew” about his college hookup except for first spouse <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meri-brown/">Meri Brown </a>and fourth wife Robyn Brown.</p>

<p>“It was really because I don’t believe I ever got intimate enough with Christine and Janelle to tell them,” Kody went on, noting that Robyn learned about his past within the “first month we knew each other.”</p>



<p>Brown added that he never &#8220;felt safe&#8221; opening up to Christine or Janelle.</p>



<p>Kody’s admission on Sunday night came amid a dramatic conversation between himself and his remaining wife, during which <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-am-i-an-idiot-for-sticking-with-kody/">Robyn lamented the loss</a> of the family’s plural lifestyle.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s just, I always thought we would be like those other plural families,” Robyn said on air. “Where they finally got it figured out and they got over whatever the issues and stuff and found their friendship and found their peace.”</p>

<p>Kody, for his part, believes this idea to be an unachievable fantasy.</p>



<p>“I wish I believed that,” he told Robyn. “I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen it anywhere. They&#8217;re all working out their stuff still till they&#8217;re dead. It&#8217;s not fun.”</p>



<p>Kody concluded via confessional that he didn&#8217;t expect to be in this position, either.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a weird place to be where I&#8217;m in monogamous now,” the TLC personality reflected. “Not out of some kind of choice, so to speak, but out of a consummate failure in marriage relationships. I&#8217;ve had three women who&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m not worth it.</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t want Robyn to see me as a worthless. Am I really kind of just not worth it?”</p>

<p>Kody Brown officially wants to be a one-woman man.</p>



<p>Not that he has much say in the matter.</p>



<p>As Sister Wives fans all know by now, Christine Brown left Kody in November 2021. Then, Janelle did the same. Then, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">Meri and Kody terminated their marriage</a> about two years ago. </p>



<p>This, of course, leaves Robyn Brown as the last woman/spouse standing.</p>

<p>On the January 5 episode of the TLC reality show, Kody will accept, well, <em>reality</em>.</p>



<p>“Will you accept me as a monogamist?” <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sister-wives-preview-kody-asks-robyn-to-accept-him-as-a-monogamist/">Kody asks Robyn in a clip</a> shared by Us Weekly, finally acknowledging that his previous life is over and adding: </p>



<p>“Is there a problem with that?”</p>



<p>Earlier this season, Robyn sort of admitted that, yes, it was a problem. She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-am-i-an-idiot-for-sticking-with-kody/">wondered if she was an idiot</a> for sticking by Kody&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>In this sneak peek, Robyn grows emotional and takes a moment before answering her husband, although she then does vow:</p>



<p>“I’m always going to stick with you. I’m just having an identity crisis.&#8221;</p>



<p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/robyn-brown-im-mourning-the-death-of-my-plural-marriage/">Robyn expressed extreme remorse</a> over the failure of her family.</p>



<p>“Kody and I, we’re getting through this and figuring this out, but it does feel like there was a death,” Robyn said back then to People Magazine of how her plural marriage has fallen apart, adding of herself and her husband:</p>



<p>“We’re both going through a death separately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cut to a confessional on this new episode of Sister Wives.</p>



<p>“Yes, I’ll always stick with him, and I love him,” Robyn says to the camera of Kody, admitting: “This is not what I wanted for my life.”</p>



<p>Robyn, who shares two kids with Kody, then tells him in the footage that she is “just sort of stuck” after all the upheaval in their family over the last few years.</p>



<p>Kody, for his part, tells his wife that he is ready for closure. </p>



<p>“Whatever I’ve done in these marriages, they’re done,” he says. “Whatever happened between me and them, I’m done.”</p>

<p>To clarify, when this episode was filmed, Christine had long been out of the picture.</p>



<p>“I’m not going to fix it with Meri,” Kody tells Robyn. “I’m not going to try and fix it with Janelle anymore. She’s done with me.”</p>



<p>This latter statement takes Robyn by surprise.</p>



<p>“She told you she’s done?” Robyn inquires about Janne. </p>



<p>“Yes,” Kody responds. </p>



<p>“Like [using] those words?” Robyn emphasizes, to which Kody once again says, “Yes.”</p>

<p>Better late than never for Kody Brown, we suppose.</p>



<p>On this week&#8217;s brand new episode of Sister Wives, the family patriarch once again was forced to confront the fact that his polygamous life was over.</p>



<p>As fans know very well at this point, Christine, Janelle and Meri Brown have all left Kody at various points over the last three years.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game-1024x538.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-510844" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game-300x158.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game-768x403.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game-960x504.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game-1080x567.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/feat-Sister-Wives-Season-19-Premiere-Kody-and-Robyn-Admit-Theyre-Struggling-Amid-Blame-Game.webp 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Robyn and Kody Brown pose here for a TLC promotional shot.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>All three mentioned here and there, too, that a major reason they were finished with Kody was how obvious it was he loved <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/robyn-brown/">Robyn Brown</a> the best.</p>



<p>“When Christine left, she told her children — our children — and even some of Janelle’s children, ‘Dad has a soulmate. That’s Robyn. I want to be free to go find my soulmate,’” Kody said on air Sunday night. </p>



<p>“When she first told everybody that, that pissed me off.”</p>



<p>Kody has been able to reflect a whole lot of late, however.</p>

<p>As the father of 17 himself has admitted, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/kody-brown-declares-end-of-family-in-explosive-sister-wives-trailer/">his family is over</a>. At least as he&#8217;s known it to be for decades and decades.</p>



<p>&#8220;As time has gone on, [my exes] are gone. I’m out of my relationships with these other wives,&#8221; Kody explained via confessional, adding of the whole Robyn soulmate thing: </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m way more inclined to accept that.”</p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t sound very passionate, does he? </p>



<p>Sounds mostly like someone who simply <em>has</em> to accept only one woman has stuck around and still wishes to be his spouse.</p>

<p>Christine was the first of Kody’s sister wives to separate from the TLC personality &#8212; back in November 2021. </p>



<p>“After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave,” she wrote on Instagram. </p>



<p>“We will continue to be a strong presence in each other’s lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family. At this time, we ask for your grace and kindness as we navigate through this stage within our family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown has since gone on to marry <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a> and seems VERY psyched about that.</p>

<p>During a November 2023 episode of Sister Wives: One of One, meanwhile, Kody did acknowledge that his feelings for Robyn impacted these other relationships.</p>



<p>“When I met Robyn, it was, you know, like first time ever being in love. So that changed the dynamic, I think. And that’s not anybody’s fault,” Kody said plainly at the time.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been chatter, though, that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/kody-brown-divorce-robyn/">Robyn might also divorce Kody</a>, which is why a source told In Touch Weekly last monthL</p>



<p>“Robyn has Kody wrapped around her finger and always has because she was – and is – the favorite wife.</p>



<p>&#8220;Truth of the matter is Kody is terrified Robyn will leave him as his other wives did. … Kody goes out of his way to make Robyn feel like a princess. His polygamist dream imploded and he’s desperate to hold onto this marriage even if it costs him.”</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve known it for years, haven&#8217;t we?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/are-robyn-and-kody-brown-facing-money-troubles-will-they-sell-coyote-pass/">Kody Brown has financial problems</a> because he&#8217;s lazy and has no job outside of reality television and is generally bad at managing money.</p>



<p>Okay, we didn&#8217;t <em>know</em> it before. We just assumed it previously.</p>



<p>But we know it now.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-18-at-3.20.47%E2%80%AFPM-1024x565.png" alt="" class="wp-image-511436"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is notoriously awful at tracking his money.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the December 9 episode of her The Authentic Society podcast, Madison Brush didn&#8217;t hold back or mince a single word when it came to her father&#8217;s ability to maintain a healthy bank account.</p>



<p>Along with the way in which he has handled this general situation in the past.</p>



<p></p>



<p>“Before the show, we were very poor,” the 29-year old daughter of Kody and Janelle told her audience, referencing Sister Wives. “My dad made decent money but we had 15 kids.”</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sorry. But that&#8217;s just too many kids.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="516" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514076" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is no longer in any polygamous relationships.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Madison, who is pregnant with her fourth child, then delved into the family&#8217;s ongoing outlook and set-up.</p>



<p>“My dad always chose the get-rich-quick scheme, almost always,” she continued. </p>



<p>“That was such a foreign thought to [husband] Caleb. And I remember explaining some ideas to him and he was like, ‘No, no.’”</p>



<p>The mother of three also noted that Kody was formerly a “sign salesman,” who spent money on random “investments with people.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-513027" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e.webp 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-300x225.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-768x576.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-728x546.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-480x360.webp 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/633750834d423e00181ff54e-320x240.webp 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown appears to be in distress here.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>She explained in further and troubling detail:</p>



<p>“When we got our tax returns when we were younger, my parents immediately spent it on something, and Caleb’s family were both educated and they did not. They saved it. They saved every penny they could.”</p>



<p>Sounds very responsible to us.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Madison seemed to echo what her mom said recently about how <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/janelle-brown-to-kody-dude-your-family-hates-you/">Kody isn&#8217;t close to his loved ones</a> at this point.</p>



<p>Not in any way, shape or form.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="575" height="373" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/kody-brown-sister-wives-2024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-511103" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/kody-brown-sister-wives-2024.jpg 575w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/10/kody-brown-sister-wives-2024-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown has no real relationship with any of his kids.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I have no contact with some of my family, and it’s because of stuff that has happened,” Madison shared on the November 11 episode of this same podcast. “[Kody] doesn’t have any respect for boundaries, and you have to play by his rules, and I just don’t care to do that.”</p>



<p>Kody was even estranged from late son Garrison at the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/garrison-brown-cause-of-death/">time of his suicide</a> because the two clashed over Kody&#8217;s very strict COVID-19 regulations during the height of that pandemic.</p>



<p>“My dad would get very angry when I would&#8230; I’m a straight shooter,” Maddie also said last month. “That was one of the reasons that I went no contact because it was like, he didn’t like a mirror being held up.”</p>



<p>Sounds like the Kody Brown we&#8217;ve gotten to know: bad with money and bad with taking responsibility of any kind.</p>

<p>Janelle Brown opened up this week about her wedding to Kody Brown.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s just say it doesn&#8217;t sound as if it was the most romantic gathering of all-time.</p>



<p>The walk down memory lane was shown on air after Janelle arrived in Utah with daughter Maddie Brush to help Christine Brown pick out a wedding dress for her wedding to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/david-woolley/">David Woolley</a>. </p>



<p>From there, Janelle couldn&#8217;t help but reflect on her own nuptials back in the day.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="500" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-514809" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330.webp 750w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/janelle-and-kody-brown-sister-wives-120624-f6dd1ee0740e4ce8830eceec6001f330-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown has made the astute decision to walk away from Kody.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I actually didn&#8217;t have a wedding dress,&#8221; Janelle said in a confessional. &#8220;When Kody and I got married, my family was very upset with my decision to join the faith, so most of my family was not talking to me or associating with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown went on to say she wore a green gown for the occasion.</p>



<p>Also?</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom was at the wedding because she came to save me from the polygamist and ended up marrying Kody&#8217;s dad three months before we got married,&#8221; Janelle explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;So my mom was obviously okay with it, but the rest of my family was really not okay with it. So they didn&#8217;t, they didn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/janelle-not-in-love-kody-embed-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-510175" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/janelle-not-in-love-kody-embed-1.webp 600w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/09/janelle-not-in-love-kody-embed-1-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown is doing all she can to recover from her son&#8217;s suicide.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. The world of polygamy can be an&#8230; interesting one.</p>



<p>Janelle was spiritually married to Kody from 1993 to 2022; they were never any legal vows exchange. </p>



<p>Before this, Janelle was married to Adam Barber &#8212; the brother of Kody&#8217;s first wife, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meri-brown/">Meri Brown</a> &#8212; from 1988 to 1990.</p>



<p>Like we just said: The world of polygamy can be an&#8230; interesting one.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-1024x576.webp" alt="Janelle Brown looks very sad" class="wp-image-500473" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-728x410.webp 728w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-960x540.webp 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-1080x608.webp 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Sister-Wives-Janelles-First-Mothers-Day-Since-Garrisons-Death.webp 1260w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Janelle Brown looks very sad in this confessional on Sister Wives.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Thinking about her future, about two years after she walked away from Kody, Janelle told the camera:</p>



<p>&#8220;If I get married again, I&#8217;m probably not going to have a dress. I&#8217;m not going to do the big white dress. I mean, I&#8217;m probably honestly going to just get married on a mountain in my jeans somewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>Christine, Janelle and Meri have all left Kody over the last few years.</p>



<p>The latter stuck around the longest and acknowledged on this same episode that she had a &#8220;good time with him&#8230; now we&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="516" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-514076" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/8572bd7a21cbb346ae8c4153fbc4aff0-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kody Brown is no longer in any polygamous relationships.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In a confessional of her own, Meri &#8212; who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/01/meri-and-kody-brown-it-really-is-over-weve-terminated-our-marriage/">announced her separation from Kody</a> in January 2023 and later obtained an official marriage termination through her church &#8212; spoke positively about her next chapter and where she goes from here.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel so much like I&#8217;m moving forward,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Eventually, I&#8217;m going to find a guy and then who knows what after that, who knows what will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latest season of <em>Sister Wives</em> is taking a turn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we creep ever closer to the finale, fans are getting an inside look not only at the start of one romance, but the demise of another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christine’s relationship with David has moved quickly, yet romantically over the last two years, with the show giving a look at their initial courtship in a way that explains why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/sister-wives-recap-season-19-episode-10-garrison-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their marriage </a>was a quick affair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, we’re also watching as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/465718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="645">Meri’s divorce from Kody</a> is finalized and true to form, it’s been painful and awkward to watch every moment.</p>



<p>And then things got weirdly sexual for the exes.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-11.59.16%E2%80%AFAM-1024x533.png" alt="Meri Brown" class="wp-image-513782"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown is just stunned by what&#8217;s going down on &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217; these days. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-and-kody-an-end-of-an-era"><strong>Meri and Kody, An End Of An Era</strong></h2>



<p>As Christine is announcing her big news to her kids and Janelle that she’s engaged, Meri is taking her own future in hand by finally moving out of Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>The big moving day arrives, and as promised Kody is on hand to help move her things into the moving van, as well as drive her stuff to her new place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s hoping she’ll take it as a “goodwill gesture,” but Meri’s sending a message to Kody right from the beginning. First, she wears a shirt about “karma,” taking a jab at their marriage.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, as it turns out, moving day lands on the pair&#8217;s 33rd wedding anniversary. Kody actually wonders aloud if she’s planned it this way, which of course, she denies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the day doesn’t feel somber. While Kody admits to having “mixed emotions” and Meri gets angry over a conversation about their bedset, the pair seem to be able to work cohesively in a way that surprises them both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then things take a turn for the weird.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-11.59.42%E2%80%AFAM-1024x675.png" alt="" class="wp-image-513781"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Exes Kody Brown and Meri Brown get a bit closer than they expected during &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217;.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meri-backs-it-on-up-into-kody"><strong>Meri Backs It On Up Into Kody</strong><strong><br></strong></h2>



<p>Also on hand for the move is Meri’s brother-in-law, Nathan, who also happens to be Kody’s best friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they start to load the truck, Meri helps Nathan bring in her exercise bike, walking backwards into the space. Neither she nor Nathan see Kody already in the truck, and because of that, Meri walks right into Kody. Well, actually, because of the angle of the move, her butt moves right into Kody. Seeing this go down, Nathan actually gives the bike a little push, forcing Meri closer into Kody.</p>



<p>It feels like a harmless joke. Everyone starts laughing so hard, they’re in tears. Meri even says she might pee her pants. But while in the moment, Kody seems to find the moment all harmless fun, he sings a different tune in his confessional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re joking about something that I certainly consider to be sacred with me and Robyn because it was sexual in nature.”</p>



<p>Ah yes, Robyn. Speaking of her…</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-12.12.41%E2%80%AFPM-1024x564.png" alt="Robyn Brown Crying on an episode of Sister Wives" class="wp-image-513783"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Robyn can&#8217;t control her emotions as Meri moves out of the Coyote Pass property<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tears-tears-and-more-tears"><strong>Tears, Tears, and More Tears</strong></h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/sister-wives-fans-to-meri-brown-wake-up-leave-kody-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="647">Kody helps Meri pack up her life to leave</a>, Janelle is finally meeting David for the first time at Christine’s new home. As expected, Janelle loves him and is nothing but happy for her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/kody-brown-marries-5th-sister-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="650">sister wife</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pair then start to talk about Meri and they agree they’re very happy for her to move on in her life. Despite their differences, they truly want what’s best for Meri. In that vein, Christine mentions that it’s not just getting away from Kody that will be good for Meri &#8211; it’s getting away from Robyn.</p>



<p>She accuses Robyn of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/02/gwendlyn-brown-my-dad-manipulated-meri-hes-a-confusing-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="651">manipulating Meri</a> and playing her like a fiddle all these years. Robyn of course denies this in her own confessional, saying it would be “impossible” to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back at Meri’s house, Robyn arrives with a gift for Kody’s first wife. They leave the guys to go back into the house and Robyn can’t control her emotions. She bursts into endless tears &#8211; and Meri, well, doesn’t.</p>



<p>In her confessional, Meri admits she’s being guarded with her emotions and won’t share them with anyone she doesn’t trust. This clearly includes Robyn. As for Kody, he knows Robyn is not “ well” about Meri’s move &#8211; but he insists he can’t relate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a heartbreak of extreme proportions that I don’t understand,” Kody says, which proves pretty ironic given what happens next.&nbsp;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-12.18.47%E2%80%AFPM-1024x565.png" alt="Meri Brown hugs Kody in tearful goodbye" class="wp-image-513784"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meri Brown hugs Kody in tearful goodbye on &#8216;Sister Wives&#8217;.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (TLC)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-final-goodbye">The Final Goodbye</h2>



<p>In the show’s finale act, Kody helps move Meri’s stuff into the B&amp;B. With the work finally done, the exes turn to each other to say goodbye &#8211; and Kody loses it. He starts crying as Robyn did, mourning the “final nail in the coffin of our dream”</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/02/meri-brown-admits-to-tough-year-says-she-just-spiraled-and-cried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="649">Meri admits</a> to his crying face she’s confused. He was the one who wanted this. He was the one who said they should breakup and end the marriage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It always blows me away that you get emotional like this. I just don’t understand,” Meri says to him<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/sister-wives-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="646">, questioning</a> his tears. In response, he just admits he’s longing for what they had.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s just, I’m looking at my life and it feels, not turned upside down. It feels like … we had something.”</p>



<p>But in his final moments, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/robyn-brown-for-the-last-time-i-am-not-kodys-favorite-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpil-monitor-id="648">Kody actually apologizes</a> for the last “seven years” and hopes they can truly now be friends. He even equates them to being “brother and sister” and jokes that he might walk his “favorite ex-wife” down the aisle one day when she marries someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this leaves Meri more confused than ever before. And can you blame her?</p>
