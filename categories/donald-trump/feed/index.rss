<p>They both got their start as New York City-based moguls, and they both hosted popular 2000s reality shows in which they tormented ambitious strivers looking to climb the ladder of success.</p>



<p>So it should come as no surprise that Diddy and Donald Trump have known one another for quite some time.</p>



<p>But are the bonds from an old friendship enough to score a presidential pardon for the disgraced rapper?</p>



<p>We may soon find out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-s-downfall">Diddy&#8217;s downfall</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/diddys-lawyers-claim-freak-off-sex-tapes-prove-his-innocence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Diddy is currently in jail</a> awaiting trial on sex trafficking and rape charges.</p>



<p>He was in court for a hearing last month, and witnesses say the months behind bars have taken an obvious toll.</p>



<p>Onlookers <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/diddy-hearing-bloated-gray-haired-mogul-enters-not-guilty-plea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described Diddy as &#8220;bloated&#8221; and &#8220;grey-haired,&#8221;</a> a shell of the exuberant entrepreneur who first made a name for himself way back in the early &#8217;90s.</p>



<p>Diddy is due back in court for the start of his trial on May 5. And insiders say he&#8217;s hoping that his old pal the Donald will render the outcome moot by issuing a presidential pardon.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1405310976-5-683x1024.jpg" alt="Sean 'Diddy' Combs attends the 2022 BET Awards at Microsoft Theater on June 26, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>“Donald was always invited to Diddy’s legendary parties,” journalist Rob Shuter told <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/sean-diddy-combs-trump-pardon-friendship-years-jail-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a> this week. &#8220;They’ve known each other forever. Diddy admired Trump’s swagger – the bravado, the flash. He built part of his brand around that energy,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Diddy thinks Donald owes him one. He’s counting on their history to keep him out of an orange jumpsuit.”</p>



<p>It might sound like a long shot &#8212; and it is &#8212; but the fact remains that Donald and Diddy go way back.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-donald-and-diddy-s-long-history-of-mutual-admiration">Donald and Diddy&#8217;s long history of mutual admiration</h2>



<p>Diddy has sung Donald&#8217;s praises on numerous occasions, and Trump memorably described the rapper as &#8220;a good friend of mine&#8221; on an episode of<em> The Apprentice</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1024x683.jpg" alt="U.S. President Donald Trump gestures while speaking during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, DC." class="wp-image-523010" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. President Donald Trump gestures while speaking during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, DC. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I have to say, I am a very strict and focused businesswoman because working for Diddy for six years trained me to have to be perfect,&#8221; Aubrey O&#8217;Day &#8212; who competed on both men&#8217;s reality shows &#8212; told Trump.</p>



<p>&#8220;Working for Diddy?&#8221; Trump asked. &#8220;I love Diddy. … You know he is a good friend of mine. He&#8217;s a good guy. Is he a good guy?&#8221;</p>



<p>When O&#8217;Day declined to answer, Trump remarked:</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh well, I think he&#8217;s a good guy, I&#8217;m going to stick up for him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an idiot, a terrible judge of character, and a liar,&#8221; one X user wrote in response to the resurfaced clip</p>



<p>&#8220;Birds of a feather,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>Trump might be willing to stick up for Diddy, but will he go so far as to issue him a presidential pardon? Hopefully Puff&#8217;s not holding his breath, as that seems exceedingly unlikely.</p>

<p>Tiffany Trump generally keeps a pretty low profile.</p>



<p>In fact, when she showed up to her father&#8217;s inauguration back in January, a lot of folks were shocked to learn that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/tiffany-trump-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiffany was pregnant with her first child</a>.</p>



<p>These days, Donald&#8217;s youngest daughter is still expecting &#8212; but it seems that that won&#8217;t be the case for much longer!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiffany-trump-s-due-date-is-right-around-the-corner">Tiffany Trump&#8217;s due date is right around the corner</h2>



<p>Tiffany took to her Instagram Stories this week to reveal both her due date and the sex of her first baby.</p>



<p>Rocking a blue dress to signify that she&#8217;s expecting a boy, Tiffany cradled her baby bump in a photo captioned, &#8220;1 month.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tiffany first hinted at the timeline of her pregnancy while posting about Donald&#8217;s inauguration earlier this year.</p>

<p>“January 20th, 2025 the evening of my dad’s inauguration as the 47th President,” she captioned a photo carousel of photos from the occasion, noting that she was “marking 6 months pregnant”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiffany-follows-in-her-sister-s-footsteps">Tiffany follows in her sister&#8217;s footsteps</h2>



<p>Not much is known about Tiffany&#8217;s husband, Michael Boulos, but he comes from money, and the president sang his praises at a campaign event last year.</p>



<p>Insiders say Donald Trump is thrilled that like his eldest daughter, Ivanka, Tiffany married an heir from an old-money family.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/01/tiffany-trump-now-that-my-dads-out-of-the-white-house-i-can-fina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiffany and Michael announced their engagement</a> back in January of 2021.</p>



<p>“It has been an honor to celebrate many milestones, historic occasions and create memories with my family here at the White House, none more special than my engagement to my amazing fiancé Michael!” she wrote on Instagram at the time.</p>

<p>Mel Gibson has had quite a few scrapes with the law over the course of his career.</p>



<p>One of the worst came in 2011, when the <em>Braveheart</em> star was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/08/oksana-grigorieva-loses-1475m-of-settlement-for-leaking-mel-gib/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested on domestic battery charges</a>.</p>



<p>He avoided jail time by pleading no contest to the charges, but the deal meant that Gibson &#8212; like most people with domestic violence on their record &#8212; would be prohibited from buying or owning firearms.</p>



<p>But Mel is a very outspoken (and, more importantly, very wealthy) supporter of President Donald Trump, which means he&#8217;s currently operating under a very different set of rules than the ones that apply to most Americans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mel-gibson-will-reportedly-have-his-gun-rights-restored-by-the-trump-administration">Mel Gibson will reportedly have his gun rights restored by the Trump administration</h2>



<p>According to a new report from the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/mel-gibson-gun-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a></em>, Attorney General Pam Bondi has approved the Trump administration&#8217;s decision to restore Gibson’s gun rights.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a privilege that was reserved for very few, as Mel is one of only nine people whose right to bear arms will be restored.</p>



<p>The administration moved mountains to get Gibson on that list, allegedly going so far as to fire a Department of Justice attorney who expressed doubts about the decision.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="706" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-706x1024.jpg" alt="Mel Gibson attends the photo call for Columbia Pictures' &quot;Father Stu&quot; at The London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills on April 01, 2022 in West Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-522762" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-706x1024.jpg 706w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-207x300.jpg 207w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-768x1114.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-1412x2048.jpg 1412w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-662x960.jpg 662w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-744x1080.jpg 744w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-827x1200.jpg 827w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1388996130-scaled.jpg 1765w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mel Gibson attends the photo call for Columbia Pictures&#8217; &#8220;Father Stu&#8221; at The London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills on April 01, 2022 in West Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-controversial-process">A controversial process</h2>



<p>Attorney Elizabeth G. Oyer says she was part of a committee whose job was to review cases of individuals with past convictions who could be eligible to restore their gun rights.</p>



<p>After completing her list, Oyer was dismayed when senior Justice Department officials asked her to add Gibson&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>“No one has told me why I was fired. But the notice was delivered hours after I declined to recommend reinstating the gun rights of a famous friend of the president, the actor Mel Gibson, who has a history of violence against women,&#8221; she wrote in an article for <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-justice-department-fired-mel-gibson-guns-1235296311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a></em>.</p>

<p>“When I came into work on Friday morning, I said to a colleague, I really think that Mel Gibson might be my downfall, and within hours of saying that, I was being escorted out of my office,&#8221; Oyer told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/12/politics/video/mel-gibson-liz-oyer-pardon-interview-digvid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a> in a recent interview.</p>



<p>This is not the first time that Gibson has received unexpected privileges from the new Trump administration.</p>



<p>In January, the White House announced plans to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/trump-mel-gibson-stallone-ambassadors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make Gibson a &#8220;special ambassador&#8221;</a> between Hollywood and D.C., alongside fellow Trump supporters Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear what sort of duties that team will undertake, but Mel might show up to their meetings strapped, just because he can!</p>

<p>Proposals that sounded like jokes a few months ago &#8212; like making Canada the 51st state &#8212; are now being seriously considered at the top levels of government.</p>



<p>And one of idea that&#8217;s been batted around in recent weeks is that of Donald Trump serving a third term as president.</p>



<p>Could it actually happen? Well, it&#8217;s complicated</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-unconstitutional-idea">An unconstitutional idea</h2>



<p>Now, a third term would not be unprecedented. In fact, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected <em>four</em> times (although he died just a few months after his fourth inauguration).</p>



<p>But shortly after Harry S. Truman replaced FDR in the Oval Office, Congress took action to ensure that no president would ever again serve more than two terms.</p>



<p>The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, and it specifically prohibits anyone who has been elected president twice from being elected again.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-1024x683.jpg" alt="Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 06, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida." class="wp-image-516085" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2183216502-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 6, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images))</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Trump supporters seem to believe that it only applies to presidents who served two consecutive terms, but that is very much not the case.</p>



<p>Constitutional amendments tend to go through a grueling approval process that doesn&#8217;t leave much room for loopholes, and that&#8217;s certainly the case with the 22nd. </p>



<p>But even though he would be 82 at his next inauguration, Trump recently assured <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC</a> that he&#8217;s &#8220;not joking&#8221; about the idea of serving a third term.</p>



<p>“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News over the weekend. “But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration.”</p>

<p>When asked whether he wanted a third term, Trump replied, “I like working.”</p>



<p>When he interviewer pointed out to Trump that a third term is explicitly prohibited in the Constitution, he replied, “There are methods which you could do it.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-methods-that-might-enable-trump-to-serve-a-third-term">What are the &#8216;methods&#8217; that might enable Trump to serve a third term?</h2>



<p>The likeliest path to the White House, would be for a Trump ally like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jennifer-aniston-trashes-jd-vance-cannot-believe-his-view-on-women/">J.D. Vance</a> to run for president and select Trump as his running mate.</p>



<p>That way, Vance could immediately step down, and Trump would become president without having to be elected a third time.</p>



<p>However! That would be a violation of the 12th Amendment, which holds that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.”</p>



<p>So, it wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but Trump supporters like Steve Bannon believe <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/1/can-donald-trump-seek-a-third-term-and-what-are-his-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the president will seek a third term</a>.</p>



<p>It certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the first time Trump tested the limits of the law.</p>

<p>If the goal was to fire up his base with more decisive action, then Donald Trump had an off day on Thursday.</p>



<p>First came word that accused rapist and human trafficker <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/andrew-tate-alleged-rapist-human-trafficker-permitted-to-return-to-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Tate would be permitted to return to the US</a> from Romania, where he&#8217;d been awaiting trial.</p>



<p>Shortly after Tate and his brother touched down in Florida, another infamous sex trafficker re-entered the headlines.</p>



<p>The Justice Department on Thursday announced the release of a handful of files pertaining to its investigation of deceased child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>It was a moment that many had been anticipating for years, but within hours, their relief turned to bitter disappointment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-administration-s-release-of-epstein-files-slammed-as-meaningless-stunt">Trump administration&#8217;s release of &#8216;Epstein files&#8217; slammed as meaningless stunt</h2>



<p>According to a report from the <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/us-news/heres-what-on-the-jeffrey-epstein-list-that-the-trump-doj-is-set-to-release-later-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a></em>, &#8220;there appear to be no new names or details&#8221; in the files.</p>



<p>Several big names reportedly appear in the documents &#8212; including <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-named-repeatedly-jeffrey-epstein-files-released-pam-bondi-2037648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a>, Michael Jackson, Prince Andrew, and Alec Baldwin &#8212; but the only information about them is that they <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/epstein-list-clinton-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traveled on Epstein&#8217;s private jet</a>, which was already public knowledge.</p>



<p>Not only that, the manner in which the files were released &#8212; the first &#8220;phase&#8221; was presented to conservative influencers like Libs of TikTok founder Chaya Rhaichik, who proceeded to pose gleefully with her binder &#8212; has been widely criticized.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-1024x683.jpg" alt="Political commentator Rogan O'Handley, aka DC Draino, TikToker Chaya Raichik, commentator Liz Wheeler and US conservative activist Scott Presler carry binders bearing the seal of the US Justice Department reading &quot;The Epstein Files: Phase 1&quot; as they walk out of the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 27, 2025." class="wp-image-520345" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-960x641.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2201631069-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Political commentator Rogan O&#8217;Handley, aka DC Draino, TikToker Chaya Raichik, commentator Liz Wheeler and US conservative activist Scott Presler carry binders bearing the seal of the US Justice Department reading &#8220;The Epstein Files: Phase 1&#8221; as they walk out of the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 27, 2025.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even some high-profile conservative influencers were critical of the handling of the Tate and Epstein situations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trump administration failed massively today. No other way to put it,&#8221; tweeted <a href="https://x.com/MattWallace888/status/1895209530398789974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Wallace</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something about this Epstein release doesn’t feel authentic. Why do we need &#8216;phases&#8217; of the release and why not just release it to the entire public at large to comb through?&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/RealCandaceO/status/1895202884641529873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Candace Owens</a> asked.</p>



<p>Some of the harshest condemnation came from Laura Loomer, who was one of Trump&#8217;s biggest supporters during his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not even joking, I literally feel physically nauseous over what happened at the White House today,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1895280069540749481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loomer tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I ordered dinner and can’t even eat it because I have no appetite from what happened today. This is really unacceptable and everyone should be calling today’s stunt out,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>On the other end of the political spectrum, Thursday&#8217;s stunt with greeted with a total lack of surprise:</p>



<p>&#8220;OF COURSE TRUMP WAS GONNA HIDE THE REAL EPSTEIN FILES! Daily Beast reported (based on literal audio of Michael Wolff and Epstein himself in 2017) That Trump and Epstein were best friends for a decade,&#8221; journalist <a href="https://x.com/KyleKulinski/status/1895310146101764466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Kulinsky</a> tweeted.</p>



<p>Trump defenders say Thursday&#8217;s move was just the first step in a long-term effort to reveal the truth about one of the most notorious sex traffickers in modern history.</p>



<p>They remain hopeful that additional information is forthcoming.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>But the game is still making headlines thanks to an unexpected controversy.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s customary for Super Bowl champs to pay a visit to the White House for a photo op with the president.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/donald-trump-taunts-taylor-swift-after-singer-gets-booed-at-super-bowl/">Donald Trump was in attendance at this year&#8217;s game</a> &#8212; a first for a sitting US president &#8212; and it was expected that winning team would follow tradition.</p>

<p>But eight days after Jalen Hurts led his team to victory in New Orleans, it&#8217;s still unclear if the Eagles will show up at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.</p>



<p>The more time that passes, the more unlikely the visit becomes. But who&#8217;s to blame for the delay?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trump-administration-has-not-extended-an-invitation-to-the-eagles-insiders-claim">Trump administration has not extended an invitation to the Eagles, insiders claim</h2>



<p>Despite social media rumors to the contrary, the Eagles have reportedly <em>not</em> turned down an invitation to the White House.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll be flocking to the South Lawn anytime soon.</p>

<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/02/24/philadelphia-eagles-white-house-invite-donald-trump/?adid=social-tw">TMZ</a>, Saquon Barkley and company have not been invited to the White House.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear if that&#8217;s by design, or if the administration has simply been too busy taking a chainsaw to the federal workforce.</p>



<p>Either way, it&#8217;s beginning to seem unlikely that A.J. Brown will not be able to lend the president a copy of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/inner-excellence-author-eagles-player-going-viral-reading-book-sidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his favorite self-help book</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like both sides have mutually agreed to keep their distance. But because we live in the age of misinformation, thousands of X users (including some professional journalists) believe that the Eagles snubbed the White House.</p>



<p>&#8220;GO F YOURSELVES EAGLES. My husband is a fan so I got onboard but F this BS,&#8221; Megyn Kelly wrote, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/philadelphia-eagles-invitation-maga-white-house-trump-super-bowl-2035202">Newsweek</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eagles won&#8217;t visit The White House? Oh cool. Pull all their funding. Every dime. If the NFL hates America then America needs to start hating the NFL,&#8221; another user added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Philadelphia Eagles have rejected Trump&#8217;s invitation to the White House. You know what, I will never support that team again. F&#8211;k the Eagles,&#8221; a former fan opined.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="687" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2200624849-1024x687.jpg" alt="U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he departs Air Force One at Miami International Airport on February 19, 2025 in Miami, Florida.

<p>Of course, the team received a good deal of support, as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;BRAVO to the Philadelphia Eagles for declining Trump&#8217;s invitation to the White House. The eagle is a widespread symbol of STRENGTH, POWER, FREEDOM, &amp; WISDOM. These team members proudly held on to their self-respect &amp; dignity!&#8221; one user tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trump openly rooted against the eagles and didn&#8217;t congratulate them… the eagles have every right not to do so,&#8221; sports journalist Chris Schaller chimed in.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not often that professional athletes who just won a major championship take so much flak. But that&#8217;s low on the list of the four million ways in which we&#8217;re living in unprecedented times.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Taylor Swift is not <em>always</em> a winner.</p>



<p>On Sunday night, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-looks-devastated-as-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-are-trounced-in-super-bowl-lix/">Kansas City Chiefs were throttled in the Super Bowl</a> by the Philadelphia Eagles, meaning Swift&#8217;s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, went home a loser.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/did-taylor-swift-get-engaged-fans-left-with-questions-after-travis-kelces-shocking-super-bowl-loss/">he didn&#8217;t propose</a>.</p>



<p>Also? <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/taylor-swift-booed-by-hostile-crowd-at-super-bowl-lix/">Swift got booed by fans</a> in attendance inside the New Orleans Superdome. Crazy, right?!?</p>

<p>Making matters even worse for the singer, who is coming off basically the best two-year stretch of any human being&#8217;s existence in all of mankind&#8230; President Donald Trump was also at the game.</p>



<p>When they showed him on the Jumbotron, the man who continually claims he&#8217;ll make America great again received a mostly positive response.</p>



<p>And, yes, Trump noticed the difference between how folks greeted him and how they greeted the singer.</p>



<p>He made sure everyone else on the planet noticed it, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,&#8221; Trump wrote after the Chiefs lost 40-22, adding for all to see on Twitter:</p>



<p>&#8220;She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!&#8221;</p>



<p>Swift, of course, endorsed Kamala Harris in her attempt last fall to defeat Trump in the Presidential Election.</p>



<p>The Commander-in-Chief previously said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/donald-trump-says-taylor-swift-will-pay-a-price-for-kamala-harris-endorsement/">Swift would pay a price</a> for such a decision&#8230; and now he must be enjoying what feels like the last laugh at her expense.</p>

<p>“She’s a very liberal person,” Trump said back in September during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, referring to Swift and her decision to voice her support for Harris after she and her opponent squared off in a debate.</p>



<p>It was a debate that many observers thought Harris won in a landslide, with staunch believers hoping it would be her first step to winning the White House.</p>



<p>Added Trump at the time of Swift:</p>



<p>“She seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s any comfort to Taylor Swift, the greatest female tennis player of all-time has her back.</p>



<p>After making a cameo during Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s halftime performance, tennis legend Serena Williams wrote the following Sunday evening on social media:</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you @taylorswift13 dont listen to those booo!!&#8221;</p>



<p>We love you, too, Tay Tay.</p>

<p>Prince Harry took a subtle shot at Donald Trump over the weekend.</p>



<p>While making a speech to open the Invictus Games in Canada, the handsome Royal didn&#8217;t mention America&#8217;s 47th President of the United States by name.</p>



<p>However, Harry did cite the events competitors and said their “courage, values and humanity” deserved special respect at a time “when there is no shortage of crises, no absence of uncertainty, no lack of weak moral character in the world.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-518851" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-768x511.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-960x639.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-1080x719.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197788291-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry delivers remarks at the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 Nation Home Welcome Reception on February 7, 2025 in Vancouver, Canada. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images for Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Typically, members of the Harry&#8217;s infamous family avoid <em>all</em> mentions of global affairs &#8230; lest they risk being seen to interfere in politics, something his late grandmother went far out of her way to avoid at all times,</p>



<p>Granted, of course, Harry is estranged from most of his alleged loved ones.</p>



<p>In general, Harry&#8217;s comments were met by cheers from a crowd in Vancouver, as he also said early in his greeting that we are “in [a] moment of difficulty and division&#8221; and gathered &#8220;here in a spirit of unity.&#8221;</p>



<p>One need not read too sharply between the lines to understand that Harry was referring here to Trump &#8212; who, in his first couple weeks as President, has threatened a war with numerous countries&#8230; blamed Democrats for a fatal plane crash&#8230; and gotten rid of as many DEI initiatives as possible across the nation.</p>

Kennedy Human Rights Ripple of Hope Gala)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s also worth remembering that Trump isn&#8217;t exactly a big fan of Prince Harry.</p>



<p>A constant (and very mean) critic of the Prince, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/donald-trump-prince-harry-deport/">Trump previously said he planned to deport Harry</a> back to the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>When asked again late last week if he still had this plan, Trump told The New York Post of Harry and Meghan Markle: </p>



<p>“I don’t want to do that. I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-1024x683.jpg" alt="Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, looks out into the crowd during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 04, 2024 in New York City." class="wp-image-517418" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2188264255-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Prince Harry looks out into the crowd during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 04, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Harry&#8217;s memoir, Spare, Harry wrote about the time he got high on mushrooms at Friends star Courteney Cox’s house&#8230; and also revealed that he had snorted cocaine at age 17 “to feel different.”</p>



<p>Speaking to Nigel Farage in a GB News interview last year, Trump (who <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/donald-trump-says-kate-middleton-is-doing-well-king-charles-is-fighting/">gets along well with Prince William</a>) said the following about Harry&#8217;s immigration status after these bombshells were dropped in the book: </p>



<p>“We’ll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they’ll have to take appropriate action.”</p>



<p>This feud dates to a 2016 Comedy Central panel show in which Markle &#8212; then an actress and not yet dating Harry &#8212; made her contempt for Trump well known, labeling him “misogynistic” and “divisive,” and joking that she might move to Canada if Trump was elected president.</p>



<p>He has, of course, been elected president on <em>two</em> occasions now.</p>

<p>In 2022, Trump told fellow <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> hater Piers Morgan: </p>



<p>“Harry is whipped like no person I think I’ve ever seen.” </p>



<p>He then predicted the couple would divorce, stating:</p>



<p> “It’ll end, and it’ll end bad… I want to know what’s going to happen when Harry decides he’s had enough of being bossed around… Or maybe when she decides that she likes some other guy better. I want to know what’s going to happen when it ends, okay?”</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump is causing a stir without saying a word.</p>





<p>On Monday, January 20, Donald Trump made history when he was sworn in as US President.</p>



<p>Now, a legendary fashion house that once dressed the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy has &#8212; in the eyes of many &#8212; diminished its legacy by doing the same for Ivanka.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-dressed-ivanka-trump-for-the-inaugural-dinner">Who dressed Ivanka Trump for the Inaugural Dinner?</h2>



<p>Oscar de la Renta passed away in 2014 following a battle with cancer. The singular designer&#8217;s eponymous fashion house remains in operation.</p>



<p>That same house also dressed Ivanka Trump for her January 19, 2025 inaugural dinner with the controversial former (and now, current) president ahead of his retaking power.</p>



<p>Not only did Oscar de la Renta (the fashion brand) dress Ivanka for the occasion, they also showcased the work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFCGSi5s4Mg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>The fashion house gushed about dressing Ivanka in the &#8220;custom off-shoulder crystal and pearl floral-embroidered empire waist gown with silver stole.&#8221;</p>



<p>As you can imagine, countless followers of the page had a very different reaction.</p>



<p>“Oh ok so we’re done with odlr,” one commenter wrote. “ODLR sold their soul,&#8221; another characterized, followed with a simple: &#8220;Unsubscribe.”</p>

<p>“Sad to be done with odlr,” another Instagram user lamented. Another agreed with an understated: “Not the house’s proudest day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other commenters noted that the Oscar de la Renta fashion brand has &#8220;lost it.&#8221; Others noted that becoming involved with the Trump crime family like this is &#8220;disgraceful.&#8221;</p>



<p>An additional Instagram user wrote: “Unfollow after maybe 8 to 10 years. Loved your content but this is unacceptable. Bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this was not an isolated incident. Earlier that same day, Ivanka Trump wore a tan ensemble for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>



<p>Oscar de la Renta showcased the photos with apparent pride. Commenters condemned the fashion house for &#8220;dressing these people.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Oof. Nope. We are not gonna be normalizing ANY OF THIS. UNFOLLOWED,” announced one critic. Many others had similar takes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-really-so-surprising">Is this really so surprising?</h2>



<p>Obviously, longtime fans of fashion and of the Oscar de la Renta brand specifically have every right to express their feelings of disgust and betrayal. </p>



<p>Even though Ivanka Trump has made a point to avoid acting as a political prop for much of this campaign, that was not true eight years ago. And in this case, she was attending her father&#8217;s formal events, not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/ivanka-trump-taylor-swift-concert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking her kid to a Taylor Swift concert</a>. This is not apolitical.</p>



<p>The overlap between the worlds of fashion and politics has long been a source of controversy.</p>



<p>As many have noted, Hugo Boss crafted uniforms for the SS. Coco Chanel was herself a Nazi informant.</p>



<p>Now, Oscar de la Renta is finding itself at the center of a heated controversy. The brand has yet to publicly respond to today&#8217;s backlash,</p>

<p>Trump has named Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, and Jon Voight to a dubious honor.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/carrie-underwood-trump-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Underwood</a> isn&#8217;t the only famous person with abhorrent judgment. It is alarmingly common.</p>



<p>Despite the recent and devastating <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/mandy-moore-los-angeles-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles fires</a>, Trump is still taking aim at Hollywood.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s naming all three outcast actors as &#8220;Special Ambassadors&#8221; to the entertainment industry. What does that mean?</p>

<p>On Thursday, January 16, Donald Trump took to his ironically named Truth Social microblogging platform to share some news.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/donald-trump-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notorious criminal</a> announced.</p>



<p>Trump then declared: &#8220;They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK &#8212; BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These three very talented people,&#8221; Trump claimed, &#8220;will be my eyes and ears.&#8221;</p>



<p>He then threatened: &#8220;And I will get done what they suggest.&#8221; That&#8217;s vague yet sinister!</p>



<p>&#8220;It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!&#8221; Trump rambled.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-did-trump-select-mel-gibson-sylvester-stallone-and-jon-voight">Why did Trump select Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, and Jon Voight? </h2>



<p>These are not three actors who come to most people&#8217;s minds. Pretty much ever.</p>



<p>However, though we hate to speculate on what passes for Donald Trump&#8217;s thought process at this point, it&#8217;s likely that he sees these men as his allies. </p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/jon-voight-angelina-jolie-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voight&#8217;s notorious politics</a> to Stallone calling him the &#8220;second George Washington&#8221; to Gibson&#8217;s famous bigotry scandals, they seem relatively like-minded with Trump.</p>

<p>Though Donald Trump clearly craves the admiration and friendship of the most famous and beautiful people of the entertainment industry, he will never have it. And it&#8217;s possible that he has realized this.</p>



<p>To his core, Trump is a man who wants to be liked. If the people whose attention he covets despise him for his behavior, politics, and crimes, then he&#8217;ll take approval where he can get it. That means actors many people had forgotten were still alive, and it means crowds of people whom Trump would sooner avoid under other circumstances.</p>



<p>As for why Trump didn&#8217;t choose someone like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/zachary-levi-cancelled-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump-supporter Zachary Levi</a>? It&#8217;s not clear if he knows who he is off of the top of his head. Trump was born in the &#8217;40s. He&#8217;d likely feel more comfortable speaking to geriatric actors who feel as if they are somehow oppressed by their own industry.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-special-ambassador-mean">What does &#8216;Special Ambassador&#8217; mean?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear what a &#8220;special ambassador&#8221; could mean in this context. &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; is merely a part of Los Angeles, one associated with the entertainment industry. It is not a foreign government. There is no political embassy involved.</p>



<p>However, Trump has been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/trump-threatens-seth-meyers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening his critics</a>, from television networks to late night hosts. He intends to leverage all of the political muscle of the White House to silence his perceived enemies, and to &#8220;punish&#8221; those whose words have hurt his feelings. This may be more of the same.</p>



<p>That is only one small part of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/jimmy-kimmel-cries-2024-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">America&#8217;s grim fate</a> in the coming years. The good news is that it&#8217;s unclear what a sideshow act like Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson could do &#8212; even with Trump backing them.</p>
