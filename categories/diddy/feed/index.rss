<p>They both got their start as New York City-based moguls, and they both hosted popular 2000s reality shows in which they tormented ambitious strivers looking to climb the ladder of success.</p>



<p>So it should come as no surprise that Diddy and Donald Trump have known one another for quite some time.</p>



<p>But are the bonds from an old friendship enough to score a presidential pardon for the disgraced rapper?</p>



<p>We may soon find out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-s-downfall">Diddy&#8217;s downfall</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard by now,<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/diddys-lawyers-claim-freak-off-sex-tapes-prove-his-innocence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Diddy is currently in jail</a> awaiting trial on sex trafficking and rape charges.</p>



<p>He was in court for a hearing last month, and witnesses say the months behind bars have taken an obvious toll.</p>



<p>Onlookers <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/diddy-hearing-bloated-gray-haired-mogul-enters-not-guilty-plea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described Diddy as &#8220;bloated&#8221; and &#8220;grey-haired,&#8221;</a> a shell of the exuberant entrepreneur who first made a name for himself way back in the early &#8217;90s.</p>



<p>Diddy is due back in court for the start of his trial on May 5. And insiders say he&#8217;s hoping that his old pal the Donald will render the outcome moot by issuing a presidential pardon.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1405310976-5-683x1024.jpg" alt="Sean 'Diddy' Combs attends the 2022 BET Awards at Microsoft Theater on June 26, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>“Donald was always invited to Diddy’s legendary parties,” journalist Rob Shuter told <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/sean-diddy-combs-trump-pardon-friendship-years-jail-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a> this week. &#8220;They’ve known each other forever. Diddy admired Trump’s swagger – the bravado, the flash. He built part of his brand around that energy,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;Diddy thinks Donald owes him one. He’s counting on their history to keep him out of an orange jumpsuit.”</p>



<p>It might sound like a long shot &#8212; and it is &#8212; but the fact remains that Donald and Diddy go way back.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-donald-and-diddy-s-long-history-of-mutual-admiration">Donald and Diddy&#8217;s long history of mutual admiration</h2>



<p>Diddy has sung Donald&#8217;s praises on numerous occasions, and Trump memorably described the rapper as &#8220;a good friend of mine&#8221; on an episode of<em> The Apprentice</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1024x683.jpg" alt="U.S. President Donald Trump gestures while speaking during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, DC." class="wp-image-523010" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2207385984-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. President Donald Trump gestures while speaking during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, DC. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I have to say, I am a very strict and focused businesswoman because working for Diddy for six years trained me to have to be perfect,&#8221; Aubrey O&#8217;Day &#8212; who competed on both men&#8217;s reality shows &#8212; told Trump.</p>



<p>&#8220;Working for Diddy?&#8221; Trump asked. &#8220;I love Diddy. … You know he is a good friend of mine. He&#8217;s a good guy. Is he a good guy?&#8221;</p>



<p>When O&#8217;Day declined to answer, Trump remarked:</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh well, I think he&#8217;s a good guy, I&#8217;m going to stick up for him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an idiot, a terrible judge of character, and a liar,&#8221; one X user wrote in response to the resurfaced clip</p>



<p>&#8220;Birds of a feather,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>Trump might be willing to stick up for Diddy, but will he go so far as to issue him a presidential pardon? Hopefully Puff&#8217;s not holding his breath, as that seems exceedingly unlikely.</p>

<p>Kanye West is having another meltdown on social media.</p>



<p>And this time, he seems determined to alienate his few remaining friends and supporters.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-threatens-kim-kardashian-were-at-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye went on the attack against Kim Kardashian </a>and her family.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197299967-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="and Bianca Censori attend the 67th Annual GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

<p>That same day, he released a song on which he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bethenny-frankel-to-kim-kardashian-you-need-to-protect-your-children-from-kanye-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with accused sex trafficker Diddy</a>.</p>



<p>Kim was upset to learn that vocals from her 11-year-old daughter were also featured on the track.</p>



<p>Kanye responded by lashing out at his ex-wife and publicly sharing screenshots of her text messages.</p>



<p>Today, Ye expanded his focus. </p>



<p>He continued lashing out at Kim (at one point, he tweeted, &#8220;I don’t give a f&#8211;k about that old white lady other than her always pulling bulls&#8211;t with my black children,&#8221;) but he also took shots at several fellow rappers, including Tyler, the Creator, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yet-another-tirade-from-kanye">Yet another tirade from Kanye</h2>



<p>He was particularly harsh in his criticism toward Drake, whom he repeatedly referred to using homophobic slurs.</p>



<p>&#8220;I DON’T PERSONALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH KENDRICK (I PROBABLY WILL NOW) BUT HE WAS A PAWN TO TAKE DOWN F&#8211;GOT(AKA DRAKE) BECAUSE THESE RECORD LABELS DONT WANT BIG ARTIST BECAUSE THE SMALLER ARTIST ARE EASIER TO CONTROL AND REPLACE,&#8221; Kanye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK WAS THE INDUSTRY PUPPET THEN THEY WAS DONE WITH HIM,&#8221; he added, in his usual all-caps style.</p>



<p>Kanye went on to say that he hates to give any credit to Drake (whom he continued to refer to with homophobic) before praising a lyric from one of his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/drakes-dad-responds-to-kendrick-lamar-diss-track-winning-multiple-grammys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick diss tracks</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-directs-his-wrath-toward-kendrick-lamar-defends-diddy">Kanye directs his wrath toward Kendrick Lamar, defends Diddy</h2>



<p>As evidenced by the &#8220;industry puppet&#8221; line, Kanye is also no fan of Kendrick&#8217;s, and he made the extent of his feelings clear today:</p>



<p>&#8220;HATE TO GIVE THIS F&#8211;GOT CREDIT BUT FAVORITE LINE OF THE BATTLE LAST YEAR IS WHEN THE F&#8211;GGOT SAID &#8216;YOU RAP LIKE YOU TRYNA FREE THE SLAVES&#8217; HE DOES,&#8221; Ye tweeted.</p>



<p>&#8220;NOOOOBODY HAS EVER LISTENED TO KENDRICK OR KNOWS ANY OF HIS SONGS,&#8221; he continued, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;KENDRICK SOUND LIKE A RAPIST.&#8221; He offered no additional context for that seemingly unfounded claim.</p>



<p>All of this came on the heels of a bizarre Instagram post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHUV88fyq8E/?img_index=1">The Shade Room</a>, in which Kanye is seen having a lengthy conversation with Diddy, who apparently called him from prison.</p>

<p>Kanye has been defending the disgraced mogul for weeks. Today he wrote that he can&#8217;t understand why so many people are &#8220;MAD AT PUFF [Diddy],&#8221; as everyone &#8220;KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HIT A GIRL.&#8221;</p>



<p>West went on to compare himself to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/wendy-williams-the-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendy Williams, who is currently under a conservatorship</a>. He then stated that he expects to be placed under a 5150 psychiatric hold because of his tweets.</p>



<p>Kenye concluded one of the day&#8217;s many tirades with:</p>



<p>&#8220;I TWEET EVERYTHING I THINK OF.&#8221;</p>



<p>We certainly won&#8217;t argue with him there.</p>

<p>Diddy appeared in court today for a hearing ahead of his May 5 trial.</p>



<p>And according to numerous courtroom reporters, the disgraced hip hop mogul looked considerably worse for wear.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/diddy-luigi-mangione-jail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy has been locked up </a>at Brooklyn&#8217;s Metropolitan Detention Center since September of last year.</p>



<p>And it seems that all those months behind bars have taken a toll on the rapper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-pleads-not-guilty-to-numerous-charges">Diddy pleads not guilty to numerous charges</h2>



<p>During today&#8217;s hearing, Diddy pled not guilty on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges.</p>



<p>That part was expected. What caught many court reporters off guard, however, was Diddy&#8217;s appearance.</p>

<p>Law&amp;Crime reporter Elizabeth Millner also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4sZMUpdH8w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quipped</a> that Diddy looked like “Santa Claus.&#8221; She also noted that many of the reporters in the courtroom today were &#8220;caught off guard&#8221; by the change in his appearance.</p>



<p>Cameras were not allowed in the courtroom, but several journalists remarked on Diddy&#8217;s disheveled appearance.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s not the only reason that Mr. Sean Combs is probably feeling a bit down today. It was, in every respect, a rough day in court for the formerly beloved hip hop icon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-s-lawyers-spar-with-prosecutors-over-cassie-beating-video">Diddy&#8217;s lawyers spar with prosecutors over Cassie beating video</h2>



<p>Ahead of his arrest last summer, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/diddy-breaks-silence-on-graphic-cassie-assault-im-disgusted-with-myself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video of Diddy savagely attacking then-girlfriend Cassie</a> was obtained by CNN.</p>



<p>In court today, Diddy&#8217;s lawyers alleged that the cable news network had altered the footage and destroyed the original copy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="718" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-1024x718.jpg" alt="Diddy performs onstage during the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential Center on September 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey." class="wp-image-521422" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-768x539.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-2048x1436.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-960x673.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-1080x757.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1677183837-3-1200x841.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Diddy performs onstage during the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential Center on September 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for MTV)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The ploy was shot down when prosecutors revealed that they&#8217;re currently in possession of the original footage.</p>



<p>Diddy is not being prosecuted for the assault on Cassie, as that&#8217;s a state matter, and the statute of limitations has expired. But prosecutors plan to use the footage as evidence of Combs&#8217; violent nature.</p>



<p>Diddy has repeatedly been denied bail and will remain in jail until the completion of his trial, at which time, he will either be freed or moved to a more permanent facility.</p>



<p>He faces life in prison if convicted on all charges.</p>

<p>A source close to Diddy tells the <em>Post</em> that the rapper is “fit, healthy and fully focused on his defense.”</p>



<p>The insider added that “he has been very active, remains in good spirits, and, as always, he was happy to see his children,” four of whom were in the courtroom today.</p>



<p>Combs reportedly blew kisses to his children and his mother, who was also on hand. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Two more high-profile figures have been named as defendants in a lawsuit against Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs.</p>



<p>A suit filed in the Northern District of California this week names NFL legend Odell Beckham Jr. and comedian Druski as Diddy&#8217;s codefendants.</p>



<p>An accuser named Ashley Parham also names singer Jaguar Wright in her filing.</p>



<p>Both Beckham and Druski have already issued statements denying the allegations.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="Diddy performs at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire in a special one night only event at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire on November 07, 2023 in London, England." class="wp-image-520978" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1780945546-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Diddy performs at O2 Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire in a special one night only event at O2 Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Empire on November 07, 2023 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Sean Diddy Combs)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In her amended complaint, Parham claims that she was drugged and sexually assaulted by the defendants in 2018.</p>



<p>She previously alleged that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-accuser-says-mogul-raped-her-as-revenge-for-tupac-murder-accusation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy orchestrated the assault</a> as an act of revenge after she made comments linking him to the murder of Tupac Shakur.</p>



<p>Druski &#8212; a popular content creator on several social media platforms &#8212; promptly took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-druski-denies-allegations-makes-strong-argument-in-his-favor">Druski denies allegations, makes strong argument in his favor</h2>



<p>The comedian not only denied any involvement with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/diddys-lawyers-claim-freak-off-sex-tapes-prove-his-innocence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy&#8217;s alleged sex crimes</a>, he also pointed out that he didn&#8217;t know the disgraced mogul &#8212; or any other famous person &#8212; at the time of the alleged assault on Parham.</p>



<p>&#8220;This allegation is a fabricated lie. I wasn’t a public figure in 2018,&#8221; he tweeted.</p>

<p>“I was broke, living with my mom without any connections to the entertainment industry at the time of this allegation, so the inclusion of my name is truly outlandish,” the comedian said in a written statement.</p>



<p>Beckham promptly replied to the tweet with a comment in which he also professed his innocence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Boy I’ll tell u what. This world makes absolutely no sense. I am covered by God. He will prevail,&#8221; the wide receiver wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;I kno who am I , I kno who u are, keep ur head. That name will be cleared. Shxts stupid,&#8221; Beckham continued.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-allegations-against-diddy-continue-to-pile-up">Allegations against Diddy continue to pile up</h2>



<p>For many, the situation recalled the recent <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/tina-knowles-denies-liking-post-about-jay-z-rape-allegations-claims-she-was-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations against Jay Z</a>, another longtime associate of Diddy&#8217;s. That accuser eventually dropped her lawsuit.</p>



<p>Jay has since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jay-z-rape-accuser-claims-hip-hop-legend-tried-to-bully-her-into-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a countersuit</a>.</p>



<p>With dozens of accusers and a host of pending lawsuits against Diddy, it stands to reason that some of the allegations will contain mentions of his many famous friends.</p>



<p>But Diddy was one of the music industry&#8217;s most famous figures for over 30 years. He knew just about everyone &#8212; and not everyone he was friends with is guilty by association.</p>



<p>Diddy is currently in prison awaiting a trial which is set to begin in May.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>Kanye West returned to X (formerly Twitter) earlier this week.</p>



<p>And in his typical fashion, the rapper seems to be taking pleasure in stirring up controversy with misogynistic, homophobic, and anti-Semitic remarks.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/kanye-west-posts-more-nude-photos-of-bianca-censori-rants-about-his-mom-on-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye posted nude photos of his wife, Bianca Censori</a>, and ranted about his late mother, Donda West.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-west-defends-diddy-chris-brown">Kanye West Defends Diddy, Chris Brown</h2>



<p>But that tirade was tame compared to the one that Ye launched in the wee hours of Friday morning. West came out guns blazing by affirming his loyalty to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/diddys-lawyers-claim-freak-off-sex-tapes-prove-his-innocence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy, who is currently behind bars</a> on a slew of sex crime charges.</p>



<p>&#8220;PUFF WE LOVE YOU,&#8221; Kanye tweeted in his usual all-caps style, adding: “@realDonaldTrump PLEASE FREE MY BROTHER PUFF.”</p>



<p>From there, West compared Diddy&#8217;s situation to that of Chris Brown, who also faced charges of violence against women.</p>



<p>“WE ALL WATCHED TAKE CHRIS BROWN AND AINT NOBODY DO NOTHING I WAS P— THEN TOO CHRIS BROWN ITS TO THE WHEELS FALL OFF,&#8221; Kanye tweeted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-launches-anti-semitic-tirade">Kanye Launches Anti-Semitic Tirade</h2>



<p>From there, West spouted anti-Semitic views in a rant that was appalling even by the standards he&#8217;s set for himself in recent years.</p>

<p>To most observers, it seems like a foregone conclusion that Diddy will spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>



<p>But lawyers for the disgraced hip hop mogul say they&#8217;re in possession of evidence that will soon clear his name.</p>



<p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard accounts of the sordid <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-accuser-says-mogul-raped-her-as-revenge-for-tupac-murder-accusation/">&#8220;freak off&#8221; parties that allegedly took place in Diddy&#8217;s home</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-s-lawyers-claim-he-s-vindicated-by-freak-off-footage">Diddy&#8217;s Lawyers Claim He&#8217;s Vindicated By &#8216;Freak Off&#8217; Footage</h2>



<p>There are nine known videos of those parties, and not surprisingly, the prosecution and the defense are making very different claims about what exactly that footage depicts.</p>



<p>The DA&#8217;s office alleges that the tapes contain evidence that Diddy drugged his female guests and coerced them into performing various sex acts.</p>



<p>But attorneys for Diddy insist that the tapes actually &#8220;confirm Mr. Combs&#8217;s innocence,&#8221; as they prove that all sexual activity at the parties took place between &#8220;consenting adults.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Contrary to what the government has led this Court and the public to believe, the so-called &#8216;Freak Offs&#8217; were private sexual activity between fully consenting adults in a long-term relationship,&#8221; defense attorneys Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos said in documents filed today (per <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/diddy-freak-off-videos-prove-innocence-defense-claims/story?id=117667549">ABC News</a>).</p>



<p>The defense went on to argue that the videos show one accuser explicitly consenting to intercourse.</p>



<p>&#8220;These videos unambiguously show that the person alleged in the indictment to be &#8216;Victim-1&#8217; not only consented but thoroughly enjoyed herself,&#8221; the defense said.</p>

<p>&#8220;At bottom, this case is about whether Victim-I was or was not a willing participant in her private sex life with Mr. Combs. The videos confirm that she plainly was,&#8221; the filing continued.</p>





<p>Needless to say, the lawyers sound pretty confident &#8212; but then again, expressing certainty about their client&#8217;s innocence is sort of their job.</p>

<p>At this point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/jay-z-accused-of-teaming-with-diddy-to-rape-13-year-old-rapper-responds/">Diddy has been accused of so many crimes</a> by so many alleged victims that it will take a lot more than a few hours of footage to clear his name.</p>



<p>In addition to the many criminal counts of sex trafficking and racketeering against him, Diddy is facing more than two dozen lawsuits from people who claim they suffered abuse at his hands.</p>



<p>His trial is scheduled to begin in May. <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-bail-request-denied-judge-deems-rapper-a-violent-threat/">Diddy has been denied bail</a> and must remain behind bars until it&#8217;s time for him to go in front of a judge.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s likely to be the most appalling celebrity trial since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/r-kelly-convicted-for-producing-child-sexual-abuse-material/">R. Kelly was convicted</a> of numerous sex crimes in 2019.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this ongoing story as more information becomes available. </p>

<p>Diddy and Luigi don&#8217;t have <em>much </em>in common.</p>



<p>On Thursday, New York sent a small army to extradite accused murderer <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/dave-franco-luigi-mangione/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi Mangione</a>. The overkill, perhaps owing to his folk hero status, was quite the spectacle.</p>



<p>Now, the polarizing 26-year-old is in a Brooklyn facility.</p>



<p>As it turns out, it&#8217;s the same jail that is currently holding someone on very different charges: Diddy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Folk hero Luigi Mangione being escorted by a small army of police during his extradition to New York." class="wp-image-515577" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_luigimangione_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Luigi Mangione, suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, arrives at a heliport with members of the NYPD on December 19, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sean-diddy-combs-and-luigi-mangione-are-sharing-a-jail">Sean &#8216;Diddy&#8217; Combs and Luigi Mangione are sharing a jail</h2>



<p>Police accuse Luigi Mangione of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. </p>



<p>Following his arrest in Pennsylvania based upon a McDonald&#8217;s snitch and his extradition, he is in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.</p>



<p>In addition to the expected murder charges, prosecutors have included a farcical <em>terrorism</em> charge. Though the state may struggle to find 12 jurors who do not <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/kim-kardashian-fans-urge-her-to-fight-for-luigi-mangione-pardon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sympathize with Luigi</a> over his alleged victim, he could potentially face the death penalty if convicted.</p>

<p>That is the same facility that is currently <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-bail-request-denied-judge-deems-rapper-a-violent-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holding Diddy without bail</a>.

<p>In addition to being in custody at the same Brooklyn detention center, Luigi Mangione and Diddy <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-attorney-baby-oil-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share an attorney</a>.</p>



<p>Marc Agnifilo informed the court on Thursday, December 19 to inform Judge Katharine Parker that he and his wife, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, will be representing Luigi.</p>



<p>Karen Friedman Agnifilo worked as a prosecutor for most of her career. She was previously chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, and only took on private practice in 2021.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="877" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-1024x877.jpg" alt="Diddy on September 21, 2023." class="wp-image-515580" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-1024x877.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-300x257.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-768x657.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-2048x1753.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-960x822.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-1080x924.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1220_diddy_01-1200x1027.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs attends the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference National Town Hall on September 21, 2023.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Congressional Black Caucus Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Diddy&#8217;s means are obvious. His wealth and celebrity status are key to his alleged crimes. But how, many wonder, is Luigi affording such a top-notch defense?</p>



<p>Public goodwill can be a powerful thing. There are already <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/grateful-for-your-sacrifice-defense-fund-for-alleged-ceo-killer-luigi-mangione-balloons-to-over-130k-as-donations-flood-in-from-supporters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowdfunding efforts</a> underway.</p>



<p>However, we here at <em>THG </em>would caution everyone to be on the lookout for opportunists and scammers setting up fake funds. Also, beware of bad actors hoping to ensnare people into making potentially unlawful speech. Do the right thing, but don&#8217;t end up on a watchlist.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-these-two-sharing-a-jail-is-a-good-reminder">These two sharing a jail is a good reminder</h2>



<p>Luigi and Diddy sharing an attorney is simply how the world works. These are two of the most high profile cases of the decade. First-rate defense attorneys will represent clients from across the spectrum of virtue, as we&#8217;re seeing here.</p>



<p>As for the detention facility &#8230; this is a solid reminder that many of the people who are behind bars &#8212; for a day, a week, or a quarter of a century &#8212; do not belong there. Even if, yes, others are heinous monsters <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/diddy-arrested-in-wake-of-sickening-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of unspeakable evils</a>.</p>



<p>For numerous reasons, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-prison-conditions-report-disgraced-mogul-sleeps-among-rats-on-concrete-floor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prison conditions</a> themselves cannot be a punishment. No matter how we feel about Diddy, his cell and conditions should be just as good as an innocent person who&#8217;s behind bars should experience. We cannot write off everyone at a detention facility, and thinking of people like Luigi behind bars could help people to promote carceral reform. One hopes.</p>

<p>Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs appeared in court on Wednesday for a hearing in his federal sex trafficking case.</p>



<p>And according to witnesses in the courtroom, the disgraced music mogul&#8217;s months behind bars have taken an obvious toll.</p>



<p>Courtroom sources say Diddy attempted to put on a brave face, greeting his children and offering holiday wishes to the assembled reporters.</p>

<p>But it seems that his appearance served as a testament to the difficulty of life at Brooklyn&#8217;s Metropolitan Detention Center.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diddy-shows-signs-of-strain-in-latest-court-appearance">Diddy Shows Signs of Strain In Latest Court Appearance </h2>



<p>Law &amp; Crime Network reporter alleged that Diddy had become noticeably thinner since his last public appearance, with far more gray hairs.</p>



<p>“He appeared just astonishingly thinner, which you can expect [from him being] inside a federal detention center for a couple of months now,” reporter Elizabeth Millner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2GS66wNnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said after the hearing.</a></p>

<p>“A lot different from the luxury lifestyle that he was living before, but he appeared very noticeably thinner, and maybe being locked up in detention is starting to wear on him.”</p>



<p>Diddy was last photographed on September 16 in Central Park on one of last days before his arrest.</p>



<p>Millner says he looks much older now, explaining that “he appeared grayer” during his latest hearing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/diddy-bail-request-denied-judge-deems-rapper-a-violent-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy was denied bail</a> at his previous hearing and he&#8217;s been in custody since September. He&#8217;s currently awaiting a trial that&#8217;s set to begin in May.</p>



<p>A source close to the rapper denied that the time behind bars has affected Diddy&#8217;s appearance or mental state.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/12/18/celebrity-news/sean-diddy-combs-thinner-and-grayer-at-court-hearing-eyewitness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>, the insider described Diddy as “fit, healthy, and fully focused on his defense.”</p>

<p>“He has been very active, remains in good spirits, and, as always, he was happy to see his children,” the source added. </p>



<p>Cameras were not permitted in the courtroom, so other than the witnesses, no one knows for sure how well Diddy is holding up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-scandal">A Growing Scandal</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/jay-z-accused-of-teaming-with-diddy-to-rape-13-year-old-rapper-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Z became embroiled in the scandal</a>, as an anonymous accuser alleged that the hip hop legend raped her alongside Diddy.</p>



<p>She was just 13 at the time of the alleged incident, which she claims took place in 2000.</p>



<p>Perhaps seeking to preemptively avoid any legal drama of his own, Will disavowed any connection with Diddy during a concert in San Diego Thursday night.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="728" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-496584746-1-1024x728.jpg" alt="Will Smith attends the Centerpiece Gala Premiere of Columbia Pictures' &quot;Concussion&quot; during AFI FEST 2015 presented by Audi at TCL Chinese Theatre on November 10, 2015 in Hollywood, California.

<p>“The world we’re in right now is really hard for y’all to discern what’s real and what’s true,” Will told the crowd, in footage obtained by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/13/will-smith-says-nothing-to-do-with-diddy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>. </p>



<p>“I haven’t addressed any of this publicly, but I just wanted to say this very clearly: I don’t have s&#8211;t to do with Puffy, so y’all can stop all the memes.”</p>



<p>Will didn&#8217;t go into specifics with regard to the memes, but it seems he&#8217;s upset by some content that he&#8217;s seen circulating on social media.</p>

<p>“You can stop all that bulls&#8211;t I ain’t been nowhere near those damn Freak-Offs. I do enough of my own s&#8211;t, don’t be putting other people’s bulls&#8211;t,&#8221; he continued, referring to Diddy&#8217;s infamous sex parties.</p>



<p>&#8220;I ain’t been anywhere near that man [or] did none of that stupid s&#8211;t, so whenever you guys hear that, it’s a damn lie.”</p>



<p>Needless to say, Will was quite adamant about his lack of any connection to Diddy.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1024x683.jpg" alt="Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures' premiere of &quot;Gemini Man&quot; on October 06, 2019 in Hollywood, California." class="wp-image-515195" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1179480776-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Will Smith attends Paramount Pictures&#8217; premiere of &#8220;Gemini Man&#8221; on October 06, 2019 in Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But he also kept things somewhat light, joking that he “doesn’t even like baby oil.” Clearly, Will does not want to wind up answering any Diddy-related questions, as Jay Z might soon find himself doing</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-diddy">What&#8217;s Next For Diddy?</h2>



<p>As for the man at the center of all of this, it&#8217;s looking more and more like he might remain locked for a very long time.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the jailed hip hop mogul continue to maintain his innocence.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ll get the chance to make their case in court when Diddy&#8217;s trial gets underway in May.</p>



<p>But however the trial unfolds, we think it&#8217;s safe to say that the court of public opinion has already reached its verdict.</p>

<p>Christian Combs, the son of disgraced hip hop mogul Diddy, is the newest member of his family to be accused of sexual assault.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddy-other-celebrities-accused-of-raping-13-year-old-girl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy is currently behind bars</a> awaiting a trial that&#8217;s currently scheduled for May of 2025.</p>



<p>He faces a slew of charges ranging from human trafficking to racketeering.</p>

<p>Most of the allegations against the famed rapper and producer have to do with the sexual assaults that allegedly occurred at his star-studded parties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christian-combs-named-in-new-court-documents">Christian Combs Named In New Court Documents</h2>



<p>And now, a new accuser is suing Diddy&#8217;s 26-year-old son for assault, battery, sexual assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>

<p>The outlet claims that the documents were delivered to Christian at his father&#8217;s mansion in Miami.</p>



<p>Grace alleges that Christian harassed and assaulted her while she was working aboard a yacht chartered by his family in 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-shocking-allegations-against-the-combs-family">More Shocking Allegations Against the Combs Family</h2>



<p>According to the documents obtained by <em>In Touch</em>, “what was sold as a wholesome family excursion into a hedonistic environment,” when guests who Grace believed were sex workers boarded the yacht.</p>



<p>Grace said the situation &#8220;resulted in an unexpected increase in workload for her and her colleagues as well as unwanted exposure to unlawful drug use, sex work, and general chaos.”</p>



<p>She alleged that at one point, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/10/diddys-kids-show-support-for-alleged-rapist-serial-sex-trafficker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christian Combs</a> “violently grabbed [Grace’s] arm and began hurting her. He pulled [Grace] to the seat beside him and prevented her from getting up.”</p>

<p>She says that Christian forced her to drink with him and would not allow her to return to the ship&#8217;s kitchen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grace-alleges-that-she-was-drugged-and-attacked">Grace Alleges That She Was Drugged and Attacked</h2>



<p>“[Grace] was quite scared and realized she was in a very dangerous situation. [Grace] was also feeling the effect of the tequila shots and quickly suspected that the tequila was spiked,” the court filing reads.</p>



<p>She says that Christian later disrobed in front of her and became “physical and extremely aggressive,&#8221; relenting only when another employee entered the room.</p>



<p>Grace says she complained to the ship&#8217;s captain, but he was unsympathetic and forced her to continue serving Christian. She later quit the job as a result of these incidents.</p>



<p>“In addition to losing her employment, [Grace] also lost her longtime partner, with whom she had planned a future. [Grace’s] partner was never the same after seeing [Grace’s] bruises on her body because of [Christian’s] sexual assault and having to deal with the mental and emotional ramifications, so they separated,&#8221; her lawyer wrote in the suit.</p>

<p>“[Grace’s] mental health deteriorated to the point that she was medicated and required intensive therapy. </p>



<p>Additionally, she fell into a deep depression and was unable to fully carry out her maid of honor duties at the wedding of her only sister in June 2023, which she had been looking forward to doing for over eighteen months,&#8221; the filing continues.</p>



<p>Grace&#8217;s attorney, Tyrone Blackburn, previously filed a suit on behalf of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/diddy-rodney-jones-sexual-assault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy accuser Rodney Jones</a>.</p>

<p>Christian Combs has yet to publicly respond to the allegations against him. We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>
