<p>Benson Boone made quite the impression at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/grammys-2025-the-complete-list-of-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Grammy Awards</a> on Sunday.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t merely mean that he had a piano on stage, did a dramatic flip, and was sporting a revealing little number while introducing himself to most viewers for the first time.</p>



<p>Amidst the sea of social media posts either thirsting after him or panning his performance (and sometimes both) was a lot of commentary about his faux pas.</p>



<p>On stage, Benson Boone adjusted himself through his pants. It was <em>not </em>a subtle gesture. Whoops!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grammy-awards-viewers-got-an-eyeful-of-benson-boone">Grammy Awards viewers got an eyeful of Benson Boone</h2>



<p>On Sunday, February 2, Benson Boone introduced himself to millions as he performed &#8220;Beautiful Things&#8221; on stage.</p>



<p>He put on quite the show, and we don&#8217;t just mean the 1970s-inspired jumpsuit with the plunging neckline.</p>



<p>Boone demonstrated his acrobatics, flipping through the air. And he still managed to perform the song.</p>



<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2/app.bsky.feed.post/3lhaibf7hvs2x" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicw5s3l2hu6xmtiqvtozj6rtdjgbmzza2jhwvc6iiyt4rif7ko4h4"><p lang="en">here&#x27;s Benson Boone grabbing his penis on stage at the Grammys for all of you whores<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2/post/3lhaibf7hvs2x?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Spencer Althouse (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2?ref_src=embed">@spenceralthouse.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3xlnz6m6bqxflw43b44ygve2/post/3lhaibf7hvs2x?ref_src=embed">February 2, 2025 at 9:22 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>However, as you can see from this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spenceralthouse.bsky.social/post/3lhaibf7hvs2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> post and so many others, Benson Boone had a bit of a &#8230; well, not a wardrobe malfunction. More like a wardrobe <em>adjustment</em>.</p>



<p>Wearing clothing is a major source of discomfort, and sometimes we need to adjust our clothing or bodies in order to feel slightly less miserable. In Boone&#8217;s case, he needed to adjust his genitals.</p>



<p>While this is far from obscene, the slight course-correction is generally considered rude to do. And you <em>really </em>don&#8217;t want to do it on stage where millions can and will see you do it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-he-has-apologized-for-his-little-whoopsie">He has apologized for his little whoopsie</h2>



<p>Benson Boone took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bensonboone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> Story in the wake of the Grammy Awards to apologize &#8212; and to attempt to explain.</p>



<p>“Sorry for adjusting my jumpsuit so aggressively on stage tonight,” he wrote atop a shirtless selfie in the wee hours of Monday morning.</p>



<p>Boone then explained, writing: “that thing was extremely restricting in certain areas.&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Benson Boone jokingly apologizes for adjusting his crotch onstage at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GRAMMYs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GRAMMYs</a>:<br><br>“that thing was extremely restricting in certain areas” <a href="https://t.co/q9nRcLRYNM">pic.twitter.com/q9nRcLRYNM</a></p>&mdash; Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1886382848883519757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 



<p>Many of Boone&#8217;s new fans were pretty eager to forgive him.</p>



<p>Simply put, if you&#8217;re thirsty enough for someone, a little on-stage mistake (it is, again, bad manners) is easy to overlook. Especially if you&#8217;re viewing them through <em>horny goggles</em>, and the genital adjustment does nothing to deter your interest.</p>



<p>Again, for many, this was their first introduction to the young singer. However, we&#8217;re sure that, in time, people will have new impressions of him beyond &#8220;the flipping guy who adjusted himself on stage.&#8221; Probably.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-is-benson-boone">Who is Benson Boone?</h2>



<p>Aside from his acrobatics and the knowledge that he&#8217;s a good-looking guy, no matter how much he self-sabotages with a bad hairstyle, many people don&#8217;t know much about him. Boone was a new face (and chest and upper abdomen) to many Grammys viewers.</p>



<p>Boone is 22 years old. He is an <em>American Idol</em> alum (sort of) who gained popularity among TikTok users, catching the attention of Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds.</p>



<p>Benson Boone is Mormon. And he&#8217;s reportedly in a relationship with fellow TikTok influencer Maggie Thurmon. Those facts have cropped up on social media as mitigating factors when it comes to some of Sunday night&#8217;s thirsty tweets. But they&#8217;re clearly not dealbreakers for everyone.</p>
