<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-find-out-who-broke-up-and-who-got-married">Find Out Who Broke Up and Who Got Married</h2>



<p>There can be no question that Love is Blind this season was filled with surprises and shockers. By the time viewers reached the wedding day finale, it was hard to really say who was going to make it to the altar.</p>



<p>Before the finale, it looked like seven couples are ready to give love a shot sight unseen, but after everyone’s getaway to Mexico, the romances started dropping like flies!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexandra Byrd and Tim Godbee, Monica Davis and Stephen Richardson, and Hannah Jiles and Nick Dorka all jumped ship, so to speak, and decided not to get together in the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That left Marissa George and Ramses Prashad, Taylor Krause and Garrett Josemans, and, Tyler Francis and Ashley Adionser the only couples on the path to saying “I do”.</p>



<p>Two couples made it, one did not. And the one that didn’t SHOCKED fans to their core.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marissa and Ramses, fan favorites from the get-go, decided at the last minute not to get married. While Marissa was happy to stay engaged, Ramses unexpectedly walked away from their relationship all together, leaving her devastated.</p>



<p>“I don’t think you should’ve come to this experience,” she told him. “How could I feel so sure? And you’re not? It sucks, I want you to choose me,” adding of their split, “This is the worst day of my life.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-visiting-a-new-city">Visiting A New City</h2>



<p>One of the other interesting twists of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/love-is-blind-reunion-8-bombshells-from-the-season-6-reunion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Is Blind</a></em> season seven was that the show called the Washington, DC metro area home. And on an election year — yikes! </p>



<p>Creator <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/love-is-blind-season-7-chris-coelen-lawsuits-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Coelen revealed season seven&#8217;s location</a> during an in-depth interview with <em>Vulture</em> MONTHS before the season aired. It was the first time Netflix had allowed so much information about an upcoming season to be divulged!</p>



<p>With the DC area as its background, it was no surprise to watch as politics came up in the pods. As usual, talking about politics didn&#8217;t help secure any romantic connections. In fact, in terms of Marissa and Ramses, it was their political views that was partially to blame for their split. </p>



<p><em>Vulture&#8217;s</em> own Kathryn VanArendonk witnessed a few pod dates get &#8220;derailed&#8221; by the subject, writing: &#8220;A handsome consultant type describes himself as &#8216;a patriot,&#8217; and although he can’t see it, the woman across from him winces.&#8221;</p>



<p>Remember who that was?!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-knew-what-they-were-getting-into-and-what-s-coming-next">Fans Knew What They Were Getting Into &#8211; And What&#8217;s Coming Next!  </h2>



<p>While creator Chris Coelen revealed <em>Love Is Blind </em>season seven was being filmed in Washington, DC, it&#8217;s possible another season could also be in the works. </p>



<p>One eagle eyed Redditor shared video of what appears to be another group of <em>Love Is Blind</em> fiancée&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix/comments/1bdiwdr/season_7_spoiler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preparing to film their search</a> for wedding gowns. The group of unidentified people were spotted outside Beloved Bridal in Stillwater, Minnesota — just outside of St. Paul/Minneapolis area. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the reality series, every season features an episode where all of the brides-to-be gather to try on wedding dresses. At the same time, the grooms-to-be are usually doing their suit shopping with their own loved ones. </p>



<p>Hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey usually make an appearance at each location for the special occasion. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahhorsman3/video/7345131517041167662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original video was posted to TikTok</a> where fans debated the location&#8217;s season status in the comments. Many believe that Minnesota will be home to the eighth season of &#8220;Love Is Blind,&#8221; following Washington, DC. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-love-is-blind-s-controversial-cast-members">&#8216;Love Is Blind&#8217;s Controversial Cast Members </h2>



<p>Following the show&#8217;s rise in popularity is a rise in controversy. </p>



<p>The most recent being that a couple of season six &#8220;Love Is Blind&#8221; cast members were not on the show for the right reasons.</p>



<p>Jeramey Lutinski was <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/love-is-blind-season-6-secret-partners-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed to have been engaged</a> just a few weeks prior to entering the &#8220;Love Is Blind&#8221; pods, as reported by Glamour. Not only did he later confirm the broken engagement, Jeramey claimed he told his &#8220;Love Is Blind&#8221; cast mates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Anybody that I was on dates with, my cast mates, and in multiple interviews, this topic was discussed,&#8221; Jeramey <a href="https://ew.com/love-is-blind-season-6-jeramey-confirms-he-was-engaged-before-filming-8599459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained in a video</a> on Instagram. He added that any footage of him explaining his engagement didn&#8217;t make the &#8220;final cut.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Trevor Sova was still in a relationship while filming the show. </p>



<p>Several texts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3rQegWL-Yn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between Trevor and his then-girlfriend</a> were revealed on Reality Ashley&#8217;s Instagram, one of which shows Trevor saying &#8220;no matter what&#8221; he was &#8220;not getting married.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-costner-s-most-recent-ex-wife-is-christine-baumgartner">Kevin Costner&#8217;s most recent ex-wife is Christine Baumgartner</h2>



<p>In 1996, Kevin Costner met Christine Baumgartner while he was on a golf course, rehearsing for <em>Tin Cup</em>. At the time, he was still married to his previous wife.</p>



<p>It was two years later, in 1998, when Costner &#8212; now divorced and with a new young child from his relationship with Bridget Rooney &#8212; and Baumgartner happened to bump into each other again. This time, at a restaurant.</p>



<p>Soon, the two began dating. That long-term relationship became something more.</p>

<p>On September 25 of 2004, Costner and Baumgartner had a beautiful and picturesque wedding on The Dunbar. </p>



<p>The 160-acre ranch, which shares a name with Costner&#8217;s <em>Dances with Wolves </em>character, remains a Costner-owned private wedding venue to this day. Though of course <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/who-is-abbey-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Costner continues to be a working actor</a>.</p>



<p>Three years after they married, they welcomed their first child, Cayden Wyatt. Costner and Baumgartner also share Hayes Logan and Grace Avery.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-had-a-bitter-divorce">Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner had a bitter divorce</h2>



<p>On May 1, 2023, Baumgartner filed to divorce Costner, citing &#8220;irreconcilable differences.&#8221; Costner&#8217;s attorney would later accuse her of planning the divorce in advance, citing a vehicle purchase.</p>



<p>It was not an amicable split. After nearly two decades of marriage, they had the two have their shared children, a lot of property (including their marital home in Santa Barbara), and clearly a lot of hurt feelings.</p>



<p>Baumgartner was aiming to be the latest of Kevin Costner&#8217;s ex-wives. One particularly eye-catching point of contention was the matter of child-support payments.</p>

<p>In June of 2023, the world learned that Baumgartner had requested $248,000 per month in child-support payments, in order to maintain the accustomed lifestyle of all three kids while they&#8217;re with their mother.</p>



<p>Costner&#8217;s proposal was that he pay $38,000 per month. Ultimately, the court did not agree with either.</p>



<p>In September of 2023, the court ordered Costner to pay Baumgartner $63,209 each month in child-support.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finally-costner-and-baumgartner-settled-their-divorce">Finally, Costner and Baumgartner settled their divorce</h2>



<p>In September of 2023, the exes settled their divorce. And despite a fight over a prenuptial agreement and a lengthy child-support fight, they ended up putting out a joint statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kevin and Christine Costner have come to an amicable and mutually agreed upon resolution of all issues pertaining to their divorce proceedings,&#8221; Costner&#8217;s representative announced on the former couple&#8217;s behalf.</p>



<p>The court formally terminated their marriage on February 16, 2024. With that, Baumgartner officially became the latest of Kevin Costner&#8217;s ex-wives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kevin-costner-has-multiple-ex-wives-who-is-the-other-one">Kevin Costner has multiple ex-wives. Who is the other one?</h2>



<p>For Costner&#8217;s previous marriage, we have to turn back the clock significantly. In 1975, Costner was in college, where he began dating Cindy Silva, a fellow student. The two married only three years later.</p>



<p>Costner and Silva welcomed a daughter in 1984, a second daughter in 1986, and then a son in 1988. In 1994, Costner and Silva divorced after 16 years of marriage.</p>



<p>The cause of the divorce was Costner&#8217;s alleged affair on the set of <em>Waterworld</em>. Ex-wife Cindy Silva walked away with an $80 million settlement.</p>

<p>Britney Spears is showing Janet Jackson some serious solidarity and praise.</p>



<p>Even though <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/britney-spears-apology-selfish-justin-timberlake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney has generously apologized to Justin Timberlake</a> for backlash he&#8217;s received over how he treated her, neither of them can change the past.</p>



<p>And she&#8217;s not the only <em>much-more-talented</em> singer that, critics say, Justin used as a human stepping stone during his career.</p>



<p>Britney is voicing support for Janet. Is this talent recognizing talent, or something a little more personal?</p>

<p>In a now-deleted post from her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britneyspears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page, the incomparable Britney Spears is singing Janet Jackson&#8217;s praises.</p>



<p>“Thank you to this beautiful lady for keeping my dreams and heart alive,” Britney wrote on Instagram in her Sunday, February 25 post.</p>



<p>The beautiful lady in question was none other than Janet Jackson.</p>

<p>“She’s always been the deepest and brightest woman at the same time,&#8221; Britney wrote of Janet.</p>



<p>&#8220;She went through so much,&#8221; she acknowledged.</p>



<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Britney then expressed, &#8220;I feel she is someone I will look up to for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-britney-thanked-janet-jackson-for-her-music-and-more">Britney thanked Janet Jackson for her music and more</h2>



<p>“Thank you for your music,&#8221; Britney wrote to Janet, &#8220;and your divine way of untangling intelligence to a far more clear view than anyone could ever imagine.”</p>



<p>Janet has endured many struggles, but for many fans on social media, Britney seemed to be referring to the infamous Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime show.</p>



<p>The February 1, 2004 sports event featured a music performance. During that, a &#8220;wardrobe malfuction&#8221; led to Justin Timberlake baring Janet Jackson&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>Last autumn, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/britney-spears-bares-her-peach-on-a-beach-after-book-becomes-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney Spears&#8217; memoir became a bestseller</a>. One of the key elements of her book was descriptions of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/britney-spears-book-accuses-justin-timberlake-of-cheating-alongside-abortion-revelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Justin Timberlake treated her</a> during their erstwhile relationship.</p>



<p>But Britney&#8217;s career survived Justin. There were times when that seemed less certain for Janet Jackson.</p>



<p>Though she and JT both issued apologies in the wake of the 2004 scandal (overblown and ridiculous though it was), somehow Justin&#8217;s career marched forward. Janet became, for a time, almost untouchable in the public eye.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-britney-mean">What did Britney mean?</h2>



<p>Some of her followers believe that Britney was saying exactly what she seemed to be &#8212; that she was cheering on a music legend. A <em>fellow </em>music legend, in this case.</p>



<p>Others believe that Britney was directly referring to how Janet Jackson weathered a scandal that Justin Timberlake breezed past.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Britney didn&#8217;t mean anything about JT, but deleted the post when she realized that people were connecting it to her ex. She is a sweet person, and doesn&#8217;t mean to sic her fans on every <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-cheated-on-me-with-a-celebrity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleazy guy who wronged her</a>.</p>
