										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Jael Strauss, the America&#8217;s Next Top Model contestant who revealed just two months ago <a href="/2018/10/jael-strauss-americas-next-top-model-alum-has-stage-iv-breast-ca/">that she had breast cancer</a>, died Tuesday morning around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>She was under hospice care at the time.</p>
<p>And she was 34 years old.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Insiders close to Strauss tell TMZ that her condition took a turn for the worse on Monday night, following several days during which Strauss was unconscious.</p>
<p>Her family has been allowing visitors to see Jael, however, up until the final few hours of her life.</p>
<p>It was clear at that point that the Season 8 hopeful did not have much time remaining.</p>
<p>Strauss chose to stop chemotherapy around Halloween and went into hospice on Thanksgiving, writing on Facebook:</p>
<p>&quot;First night in hospice. So many things I never knew about life. Or death. So many things.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It was only a month or so before this transition that Strauss wrote a lengthy and emotional message to fans about her Stage IV breast cancer.</p>
<p>Likely aware at the time that the diagnosis was fatal, she said: &quot;It has aggressively spread throughout my body and is incurable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With treatment it may prolong my life longer than the &#8216;few months&#8217; doctors said I could make it. I don&#8217;t want to die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need another one of those miracles that I got back in 2013.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>With this statement, Strauss was referring to a past battling the devastating affects of crystal meth addiction.</p>
<p>This was something difficult and personal, and which she addressed publicly in an appearance on Dr. Phil in 2012.</p>
<p>In August, just two months before the breast cancer diagnosis, Strauss celebrated five years of sobriety.</p>
<p>This is what she wrote on Instagram in tribute to herself, her situation and all those who helped her along the way:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p><em>I know a few things to be true: </em></p>
<p><em>Miracles are real, Recovery is possible for everyone no matter how far gone you think you are, We are never too broken to be put back together.</em></p>
<p><em>Service work feels better than the greatest high.</em></p>
<p><em>Sobriety makes you weirder not normal and I&#8217;d be dead if it weren&#8217;t for all the love and forgiveness I&#8217;ve been showered with by my friends and family.</em></p>
<div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/19-shocking-reality-star-deaths/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"></div><h2 class="block-title">The Most Shocking and Sad Reality Star Deaths: Gone, But Not Forgotten</h2></div></a><div class="block-data"><div class="block-button"><a class="btn" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/19-shocking-reality-star-deaths/"><span>VIEW GALLERY</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="arrow-right" width="32px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 32 12"><g transform="translate(0,12) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill="#000000" stroke="none"><path d="M240 60 l0 -61 35 27 c19 14 35 30 35 34 0 4 -16 20 -35 34 l-35 27 0 -61z"/><path d="M4 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M84 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M164 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>A GoFundMe was opened for Strauss about a month ago that has thus far raised more than $18,000 to fund her treatment.</p>
<p>SAid Jael&#8217;s family and friends to TMZ in a statement:</p>
<p>&quot;The one blessing was that we were able to show her how loved she was before she passed. She brought so much light to people.&quot;</p>
<p>As mentioned above,&nbsp;Strauss competed on the eighth season of America&rsquo;s Next Top Model in 2007 and finished sixth in the competition.</p>
<p>May Jael Strauss rest in peace.</p>

<p>These are the heartbreaking words penned by&nbsp;Jael Strauss on her Facebook page in a message to fans that relayed the most painful news imaginable:</p>
<p>She has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;I was gonna write some long thing but some of you guys deserve to know,&rdquo; the 34-year old wrote last week, four days into Breast Cancer Awareness month.</p>
<p>She then added very simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On October 2nd I was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. It has aggressively spread throughout my body and is incurable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stage IV is the final and most serious stage for cancer.</p>
<p>It is not always a death sentence, but as Strauss writes here, there is rarely any treatment options for someone that has contracted such an illness.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Strauss later confirmed that the name of her illness was rapidly progressive metastatic inflammatory breast cancer.</p>
<p>She went on to explain that undergoing chemotherapy and treatment <em>may</em> help extend her doctors&rsquo; original prognosis.</p>
<p>&quot;With treatment it may prolong my life longer than the &ldquo;few months&rdquo; doctors said I could make it,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to die. I need another one of those miracles that I got back in 2013.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Strauss competed on the eighth season of America&rsquo;s Next Top Model in 2007, finishing six among all contestants.</p>
<p>Just this past August, she celebrated five years of sobriety, writing at the time on Instagram;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I have 5 years sober. Good God!</p>
<p>&quot;I know a few things to be true: Miracles are real, Recovery is possible for everyone no matter how far gone you think you are, We are never too broken to be put back together.&quot;</p>
<p>She talked years ago with Dr. Phil about how an intervention by her loved ones allowed her to overcome her addiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Hence the reference above to the year 2013.)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Service work feels better than the greatest high, Sobriety makes you weirder not normal,&rdquo; she continued last month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d be dead if it weren&rsquo;t for all the love and forgiveness I&rsquo;ve been showered with by my friends and family. Thank you to anyone that&rsquo;s ever let me sponsor them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To help offset some of the medical costs, Strauss&rsquo; friends have set up a GoFundMe page on her behalf, confirming that the former model has already started chemotherapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we do know is that Jael is putting all of her energy and drive into fighting this insidious disease and can use as much support and love as possible,&rdquo; reads the fundraising page, noting that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jael is in tremendous pain right now and is unable to work. In a month, she will be let go from her job and lose her health insurance.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>It adds:</p>
<p><em>Jael, being the selfless person that she is, has helped countless people throughout her life as an advocate for recovery and social justice. </em></p>
<p><em>She has offered everything she has to people in need; no matter what their situation, she is always ready to help with an empathetic heart and nonjudgmental spirit. </em></p>
<p><em>She has created &ldquo;gofundmes&rdquo; for literally dozens of her friends, and it is now time for us to pay her back. </em></p>
<p><em>We have the chance, and honestly the obligation, to step up and return the favor.</em></p>
<p>You can donate to her cause <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/jaelsbattlewithcancer" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>The campaign has since raised over $7,800 in three days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Currently fighting stage 4 inflammatory breast cancer,&rdquo; reads Jael&#8217;s Instagram bio. &ldquo;Plz send miracles.&quot;</p>
<p>We are doing just that.</p>

<p>America&#8217;s Next Top Model is coming to an end.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>With only a few of episodes remaining until Tyra Banks crowns the winner of America&#8217;s Next Top Model Cycle 22, the iconic model has came out on Wednesday and said she&#8217;s prepared to wrap up the long-running reality program.</p>
<p>For good.</p>
<p>&quot;TYRA MAIL! Thinking #ANTM22 should be our last cycle. I truly believe it&#8217;s time. May your pics be forever fierce. Keep on Smizing!&quot; Banks wrote.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether Tyra truly arrived at this decision on her own or whether The CW basically canceled the fashion-based competition.</p>
<p>Either way, the series finale will now air on December 4 at 9/8c.</p>
<p>According to a CW source, the network is planning a retrospective special for some time in 2016.</p>
<p>&quot;America&#8217;s Next Top Model was a successful franchise for two networks, first at UPN and then The CW, and it became not just a ratings hit, but a global pop culture phenomenon,&quot; said Mark Pedowitz, President of the CW, in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to thank Tyra and Ken for all their years of success in establishing a show that was not just popular in the U.S., but all across the world.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Tyra Banks is changing it up with a chic pixie cut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutting your hair isn&rsquo;t easy for a supermodel. One bad alteration could damage a career.</p>
<p>But Tyra said f*ck it, and <a href="http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2015/04/09/tyra-banks-explains-short-pixie-cut/">chopped it all off</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In an interview with People Magazine, Tyra explains what made her drastically change her look.</p>
<p>Banks says, &ldquo;I come from the school of hardcore branding and if you are known for something keep that because that is what the public connects you with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continues, &ldquo;I had long, golden hair as a high-fashion model, and a Victoria&rsquo;s Secret model and a Sports Illustrated model, and that&rsquo;s how people know me. But great brands tweak their logos and change up their formula, and I said it&rsquo;s time for me to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posting photos of inspirational cuts on Instagram, it appears this may have been a tough choice for Banks.</p>
<p>But her mother&#8217;s positive reaction suggests that she may have supported her daughter&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mom keeps talking about my neck. She [mom] says, &ldquo;They know you&rsquo;ve got a neck now,&rdquo; Banks shares.</p>
<p>We think Tyra looks fabulous with short hair. But Tyra is still getting used to it.</p>
<p>The supermodel and host of America&rsquo;s Next Top Model says she feels &ldquo;very exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, that exposure is encouraging a new and improved version of Tyra.</p>
<p>According to Banks, the cut has forced her to &ldquo;push those shoulders back&rdquo; and change her style to outfits with &ldquo;structure and angles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Futuristic businesswoman is what I&rsquo;m going for with this hair,&rdquo; Banks explains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using her hair for publicity is not a new strategy for Banks. &nbsp;The last time <a href="/2009/09/tyra-banks-real-hair-revealed/?PageSpeed=noscript">her hair made the news</a>, it was feeble attempt to connect with us regular folk.</p>
<p>After watching Tyra force tearful, young models to chop off their hair on episodes of ANTM, it is nice to see Tyra heed her own advice.</p>

<p>TMZ is reporting that the 19-year-old&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2015/02/25/mirjana-puhar-dead-americas-next-top-model-murder-triple-homicide/">Puhar was found dead</a> alongside her boyfriend and one other victim inside the boyfriend&#8217;s home.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Sources say a friend discovered the bodies of Puhar and her boyfriend when she&nbsp;entered the house after hearing gunshots.</p>
<p>The third body was found when police responded to a 911 call.</p>
<p>A native of Serbia, Mirjana Puhar fled to the United States with her family during the Kosovo War when she was just five years old.</p>
<p>After dropping out of high school, Puhar reportedly worked a variety of low-paying jobs before entering the world of modeling.</p>
<p>She was featured in the 21st&nbsp;cycle of <em>ANTM</em> at the age of 18.</p>
<p>She made headlines at the time as the youngest member of the cast, and she formed a romantic relationship with a male model during her time on the show.</p>
<p>However, it is believed that the boyfriend who was murdered Tuesday is <em>not</em> the man that Puhar dated on the long-running reality program.</p>
<p>Police have not released any information regarding suspects or the identity of the third victim in this tragedy at this time in what is a developing story.</p>
<p>We will have more details as they become available &#8230;</p>

<p>Thompson, the first plus-size <em>America&#8217;s Next Top Model</em> winner, is a natural fit to represent a full-figured, fashion forward customer, the brand says.</p>
            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>

Why?</p>

<p>Alway, who finished third on ANTM Cycle 8, was arrested on June 28 in Palm Springs, Calif., and slapped with a ton of charges &#8230; to say the least.</p>
<p>She was busted for suspicion of burglary, fraud, possession of narcotics, forged bills, and committing a felony while on bail (!) to name just a few.</p>
        <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
      
<p>Police were called about a suspicious female lurking around a house that was supposed to be vacant; there, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/13/americas-next-top-model-renee-alway-arrested-gun/">they found Alway in the garage </a><em>with a gun</em>.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;"> </span>
</div>
<p>Officers had reason to believe another person, a male, was also in the house, and also packing heat, so they reportedly called in the SWAT team.</p>
<p>No one else was found inside after their sweep, but the 27-year-old Alway was booked and remains behind bars now, unable to post $150,000 bail.</p>
<p>As for why she was out on bail the first time, Renee Alway was arrested back on June 2 for possession of drug paraphernalia, petty theft, and fraud.</p>
<p>She pleaded not guilty, and was released on bail &#8230; then this above incident took place four weeks later, landing her back in the pokey again. Insane.</p>
