<p>Chris Brown getting nominated for (more) Grammys is earning major backlash. Well-deserved backlash.</p>



<p>Chris Brown has been accused of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/06/chris-brown-under-investigation-for-hitting-yet-another-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous wrongdoings</a>, including <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/07/chris-brown-sued-for-50-million-accused-of-beating-up-own-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beating up his own fans</a>. He pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna in 2009, confirming the criminal charges against him at that time. </p>



<p>Which means that Chris Brown is not an &#8220;alleged&#8221; monster; he&#8217;s just a monster. It is known.</p>



<p>And yet &#8230; the industry does <em>not </em>seem to care. Neither do whichever people actually keep buying his music.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Brown on January 26, 2020." class="wp-image-512958" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_01-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Brown attends the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center on January 26, 2020.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gross-chris-brown-has-been-nominated-for-more-grammys">Gross! Chris Brown has been nominated for more Grammys</h2>



<p>The Grammy Awards are tonight, and many of the nominated names are exactly who you&#8217;d expect after a solid year for music.</p>



<p>Obviously, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter are up for Grammys. Beyonce is once again a music industry MVP, even if <em>some </em>awards shows have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/beyonce-snubbed-by-country-music-awards-beyhive-vows-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snubbed her</a>.</p>



<p>Charlie XCX. Taylor Swift. Billie Eilish. All music that normal people with taste likely listened to (even if not everyone listens to all of or only this music, of course!)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Brown on August 3, 2024." class="wp-image-512959" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_02-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Brown performs during The 11:11 Tour at T-Mobile Arena on August 03, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mindy Small/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But then, the Grammy nominations take a bitter twist.</p>



<p>For Best R&amp;B Performance, Chris Brown has a nomination for &#8220;Residuals.&#8221; For Best R&amp;B Album, Chris Brown has a nomination for <em>11:11 (Deluxe)</em>. </p>



<p>The Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song includes another nomination. Chris Brown was one of the people who worked on &#8220;Praise.&#8221; And for Best African Music performance, Chris Brown has a Grammy nomination for &#8220;Sensational.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="501" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_01.png" alt="A dark mode screenshot of a Twitter user eager to leave Chris Brown behind after his Grammys nominations." class="wp-image-512961" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_01.png 900w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_01-300x167.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_01-768x428.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Twitter, people were quick to express eagerness for the music industry and society as a whole to leave Chris Brown behind.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obviously-chris-brown-getting-grammy-nominations-is-getting-well-deserved-backlash">Obviously, Chris Brown getting Grammy nominations is getting well-deserved backlash</h2>



<p>Even though Twitter is in its death spiral as a platform, <a href="https://x.com/OnikaGauff/status/1854937524407611466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> after <a href="https://x.com/vigcup/status/1854938018865369455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> is calling out the Grammy Awards for nominating Chris Brown.</p>



<p>An <em>admitted </em>domestic abuser who has been accused of having other victims will very likely get to walk onto the stage at the next Grammys and hold up an award.</p>



<p>Some of his accusers may be in the audience. Alleged victims who&#8217;ve never come forward may be there. <em>Future </em>potential victims might be there, think that he must be an okay person, and find out the hard way that he is not. Whatever happened to the &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; that awful dudes are always whining about?</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="678" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02.png" alt="A dark mode Twitter screenshot of people lamenting Chris Brown's Grammys nominations in 2024." class="wp-image-512962" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02.png 893w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02-300x228.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_tweet_02-768x583.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On Twitter, people lamented that the Grammy Awards don&#8217;t seem to care about right and wrong &#8212; not more than they care about honoring Chris Brown, anyway.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Image Credit: Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The grim reality, of course, is that &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; as so many people mean it never actually existed. And that&#8217;s unfortunate.</p>



<p>Yes, there are absolutely people who spend their free time calling out others on social media. Usually, it&#8217;s for clout, and can be for invented reasons &#8212; fandom disagreements and the like. In that sense, sure, &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; exists. But that&#8217;s not what people mean when they say it.</p>



<p>The &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; towards sexual predators, abusers, and other monsters? If <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/11/whoopi-goldberg-refuses-to-say-trump-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent political events</a> have taught us nothing else, it&#8217;s that we don&#8217;t live in a good enough or just enough society for most of the evil in our midst to face meaningful consequences.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="921" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1024x921.jpg" alt="Chris Brown on August 3, 2024." class="wp-image-512960" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1024x921.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-300x270.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-768x691.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-2048x1843.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-960x864.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1080x972.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/1108_chrisbrown_03-1200x1080.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Brown performs during The 11:11 Tour at T-Mobile Arena on August 03, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo Credit: Mindy Small/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cancel-culture-isn-t-just-a-myth-it-s-a-grift">&#8216;Cancel culture&#8217; isn&#8217;t just a myth; it&#8217;s a grift</h2>



<p>In fact, for years now, claims that someone is &#8220;silenced&#8221; or &#8220;deplatformed&#8221; or &#8220;canceled&#8221; have been nothing short of farcical.</p>



<p>The running joke is that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/07/dave-chappelle-first-avenue-show-canceled-after-pushback-from-staff-patrons-performers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these men</a> get their own speaking tours, their own Netflix comedy specials, their own news segments, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/04/louis-ck-wins-grammy-cancel-culture-for-will-smith-but-not-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their own Grammys</a>. All so that they can discuss just how much &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; has harmed them. There&#8217;s an entire industry that has cropped up around grifters coasting on the claim that they&#8217;ve been unjustly &#8220;canceled.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the case of Chris Brown, he&#8217;s up for a Grammy Award. Again. Because people keep buying his music. They keep going to his concerts. And then record companies and members of the academy keep nominating him for awards that he could <em>never </em>deserve.</p>

<p>You may not believe this, but Chris Brown has once again been accused of acting in a violent manner.</p>



<p>According to a lawsuit filed on July 21, Brown and members of his entourage “brutally and severely beat” up four individuals &#8212; Larry Parker, Joseph Lewis, Charles Bush and Damarcus Powell &#8212; in what was described in the document as an unprovoked attack backstage at a concert at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>



<p>The incident took place on July 19.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="716" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1024x716.jpg" alt="Chris Brown in Ireland" class="wp-image-504582" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1024x716.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-300x210.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-768x537.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-2048x1433.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-960x672.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1080x756.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1247052253-1200x840.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chris Brown performs as part of his &#8220;Under The Influence&#8221; Europe Tour at The 3Arena Dublin on February 11, 2023 in Dublin, Ireland. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Charles McQuillan/Getty Images for Live Nation UK)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is what reportedly transpired:</p>



<p>The four men cited above were invited backstage after to meet Brown after the artist had finished his latest performance; Brown showed up 30 minutes later than anticipated for this meet-up.</p>



<p>At one point, Bush approached Brown to congratulate him on the show&#8230; prompting a member of the singer’s entourage to remind Brown that the two previously had issues. </p>



<p>Brown allegedly said to Bush, “Oh yeah, we were. What’s up, n—a? I don’t forget shit.” </p>



<p>The lawsuit states that Brown and seven to 10 members of his group proceeded to assault Bush and punch him in the chest&#8230; it also says that someone picked up a chair and hurled it at Bush’s head.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Brown told one of his accomplices, Markies Deandre Conway (a.k.a. Yella Beezy), and others to “f-ck” Parker up, leaving him horribly beaten. </p>



<p>The lawsuit claims Parker became trapped in a stairwell where he was then attacked by Brown.</p>



<p>“Upon instruction by Brown, Parker was then punched in the face and chest, kicked in the head for over ten minutes, and stomped on by Defendant Brown and his associates,” the lawsuit alleges. </p>



<p>“Brown encouraged his companions to join in the assault simultaneously. </p>



<p>&#8220;Brown and his entourage then continued to beat Plaintiff Parker closed fisted for almost minutes, repeatedly stomping on Defendant Parker’s head, kicking his face and ribs, and causing severe bodily injury.”</p>

<p>The plaintiffs (one of whom says he needed &#8220;extensive medical treatment&#8221;) are asking the court for compensatory and punitive damages “in excess [of] $50 million,” in addition to actual damages that include “pecuniary losses, pain and suffering, disfigurement, mental anguish, and past, present, and future medical expenses.&#8221;</p>



<p>The lawsuit also claims that Live Nation has continued its relationship with Brown despite his history of “bad conduct and violent conduct&#8221; and “shamelessly profits and promotes Brown’s The 11:11 Tour and brought Brown to Texas for financial gain.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2009, of course, Chris Brown pleaded guilty to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/chris-brown-to-rihanna-congrats-on-becoming-a-mom-do-you-still-h/">assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna</a> &#8212; and three years later was involved in an altercation with Drake at a New York City club. </p>



<p>The artist&#8217;s former manager sued him for assault and battery in 2016.</p>



<p>A year later ex-girlfriend Karreuche Tran got a five-year restraining order against him over alleged threats.</p>



<p>In 2022, Brown was sued for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/chris-brown-sued-for-alleged-drugging-rape-evil-artist-denies-al/">allegedly drugging and raping a woman</a> on board a yacht two years earlier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Domestic abuser and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/chris-brown-sued-for-alleged-drugging-rape-evil-artist-denies-al/">accused rapist Chris Brown</a> is deservedly controversial, to say the least.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not everyone sees clearly when it comes to what the rapper deserves.</p>



<p>For one thing, he is not incarcerated despite numerous harrowing allegations and incidents. For another, he won an AMA.</p>



<p>At the American Music Awards, Kelly Rowland scolded the crowd for booing the disgraced rapper at the sound of his name. <em>No, Kelly, no</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Over the weekend, some serious poor judgment led to Chris Brown winning an award.</p>



<p>He somehow landed a shoutout at the American Music Awards. He won the category of Favorite Male R&amp;B Artist.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the notorious scumbag was not physically present.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Former Destiny&#8217;s Child member Kelly Rowland was the one who announced this shameful award.</p>



<p>She then shared that she would accept it on Brown&#8217;s behalf.</p>



<p>However, many members of the audience began to very sensibly boo at the mention of Brown&#8217;s name.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Now THIS is elegant. What do you think of Kelly Rowland&#8217;s chosen ensemble?</figcaption></figure>



<p>This righteous condemnation from the audience did not serve as a wakeup call to Rowland, unfortunately.</p>



<p>Instead, she interrupted her proxy acceptance speech.</p>



<p>Holding up a finger, she told the audience: &#8220;Excuse me. Chill out.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Rowland pressed on, having the gall to call Brown an &#8220;incredible performer.&#8221;</p>



<p>There is a toxic element in our culture that believes that &#8220;great men&#8221; should be able to get away with evil. </p>



<p>For some, it&#8217;s about worshiping alleged geniuses. But there are people who think that <em>dancing </em>should be a get-out-of-jail card.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Kelly Rowland then went on to address the despicable man directly, speaking into the camera.</p>



<p>“Chris, thank you so much for making great R&amp;B music,” she expressed for some reason.</p>



<p>“I’ll take this award [and] bring it to you,&#8221; Rowland then vowed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="988" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1024x988.jpg" alt="Chris Brown in 2021" class="wp-image-32141" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1024x988.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-300x289.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-768x741.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1536x1481.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-735x709.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-335x323.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-347x335.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-520x501.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-640x617.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-960x926.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1080x1042.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>Chris Brown tries to look all mean and tough in this photo. He seems like a bad person to us.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; Rowland then announced about the man who is fundamentally undeserving of affection.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations,&#8221; she concluded, &#8220;and congratulations to all the nominees in this category.”</p>



<p>You can see this moment for yourself, right here:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Kelly Rowland tells AMAs crowd to ‘chill out’ after Chris Brown win gets booed | Page Six" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/duDiwdqTTvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It is all, to put it bluntly, pretty gross.</p>



<p>First, that anyone would nominate Chris Brown for an award, and that he would then go on to win it.</p>



<p>And second, that a legend like Kelly Rowland would be so unwise as to defend the notorious monster.</p>

He can dance nearly as well as he can beat women.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More than a decade ago, Chris Brown pleaded guilty for the savage beating of then-girlfriend, Rihanna.</p>



<p>The photo of her bleeding face made the rounds on social media.</p>



<p>Brown has long expressed a desire the the world forget and move on. And some of his <em>spineless </em>fans have been eager to do so.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption>Chris Brown was arrested in July 2018 for outstanding warrants. This is his mug shot from that incident.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But Rihanna is not the only victim in the mix. She is simply the most famous &#8212; and the case to which he confessed.</p>



<p>Brown is nothing if not infamous. Restraining orders, domestic violence accusations, death threats, rape allegations.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a real shame that Brown is still winning awards and enjoying a successful career. Some people will gleefully turn a blind eye to anything if taking a stand is inconvenient.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Earlier this week, fans rejoiced at the glorious news that <a href="/2022/05/rihanna-gives-birth-welcomes-first-kid-ever/">Rihanna had welcomed her first child</a>.</p>
<p>Ever since the pop icon <a href="/2022/01/rihanna-pregnant-with-first-ever-baby/">revealed her pregnancy</a> back in January, her army of devoted supporters gave been awaiting the big day with bated breath, and they can&#8217;t wait to receive updates about the RiRi&#8217;s new addition.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, they&#8217;re focused on protecting the singer from a toxic presence that&#8217;s been lurking on the outskirts of her life for 13 years.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;re likely aware singer <a href="/2018/10/chris-brown-i-still-wanna-bang-rihanna/">Chris Brown savagely beat Rihanna</a> during their relationship back in 2009.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Astonishingly, Brown avoided jail time and still has some semblance of a career as an entertainer.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that after nearly killing Rihanna, he would have the decency to keep his distance from his ex during the most joyous time of her life.</p>
<p>Shortly after news of the successful delivery was made public, Chris posted a pregnant woman emoji, a heart, praying hands, and a single word, &quot;Congratulations,&quot; on his Instagram Story.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Obviously, the brief message was meant for Rihanna, and fans are outraged that Brown felt the need insinuate himself in the moment.</p>
<p>An insider close to the situation tells <em>Hollywood Life</em> that Brown had hoped to send his message to his ex without stirring up any unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>Clearly, he failed in that endeavor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris wanted to send his well wishes to Rihanna but he&rsquo;s also not trying to make any drama for her with Rocky,&rdquo; <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2022/05/19/chris-brown-rihanna-baby-asap-rocky-message/">a source </a>told the site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Posting it on his story is his way of reaching out but still being respectful. He knows she will hear about it and he&rsquo;s sure that she&rsquo;ll be happy because he&rsquo;s letting her and the world know that he&rsquo;s sending nothing but good vibes,&rdquo; the insider continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s true, Chris is genuinely happy for her. There was a time when it would have been hard for him to handle Rihanna having a baby with another man, but he&rsquo;s grown now, all that baggage is behind him. Now, it&rsquo;s nothing but love and respect.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>The source adds that Brown &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t be happier for her,&rdquo; as he knows that Rihanna has always wanted kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becoming a parent has been the greatest gift Chris has ever known, and he knows Rihanna will experience the same feelings,&rdquo; the insider revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable texting her, so he thought it would be appropriate to congratulate her and Rocky on social media. He&rsquo;s not trying to step on toes but is truly happy for her and just wanted to send his best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chris has three children with three different women, Royalty Brown, with Nia Guzman, as well as a son, Aeko, with Ammika Harris, and daughter, Lovely, with Diamond Brown.</p>
<p>Rihanna is rumored to be <a href="/2022/03/rihanna-is-that-an-engagement-ring-on-her-finger/">engaged to A$AP Rocky</a>, the rapper who fathered her child.</p>
<p>Whatever winds up happening between these two, we&#8217;re sure that Rihanna remains grateful that Chris is no longer a major part of her life.</p>
<p>And that she escaped that abusive situation without becoming permanently tethered to that loser by having a child together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Back in January, <a href="/2022/01/chris-brown-sued-for-alleged-drugging-rape-evil-artist-denies-al/">Chris Brown was sued for drugging and raping</a> an unidentified woman on a yacht owned by music producer Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs.</p>
<p>The alleged incident occurred in December of 2020.</p>
<p>We probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that this is not the first time that Brown has been accused of violent and abusive behavior toward women.</p>
<p>In fact, at this point, he&#8217;s better known for his atrocities than he is for his music.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-683x1024.jpg" alt="Chris Brown In 2022" class="wp-image-414700" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/03/chris-brown-in-2022.jpg 1365w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>In this case, the woman, known only as Jane Doe, filed a suit in which she claimed that Brown slipped her drugs that left her &ldquo;disoriented, physically unstable, and started to fall in and out of sleep.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She alleged that the singer had raped her while she was passed out aboard the yacht.</p>
<p>Brown responded to the allegations publicly, writing on Instagram:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2048" height="1975" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021.jpg" alt="Chris Brown in 2021" class="wp-image-32141" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-300x289.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1024x988.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-768x741.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1536x1481.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-735x709.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-335x323.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-347x335.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-520x501.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-640x617.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-960x926.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1080x1042.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever I&rsquo;m releasing music or projects, &lsquo;THEY&rsquo; try to pull some real bulls&ndash;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He included a baseball cap emoji &#8212; &quot;cap&quot; being slang for &ldquo;lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The public was understandably hesitant to credit Brown&#8217;s denials of the allegation, especially given his long history of abuse.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Now, however, it appears that new evidence may have exonerated the controversial R&amp;B star.</p>
<p>According to a new report from Page Six, the accuser has been dropped by her attorneys after text messages came to light that appear to exonerate Brown.</p>
<p>Attorneys Ariel Mitchell and George Vrabeck told the outlet that they &ldquo;remain 100% committed to representing victims of sexual abuse or assault.&rdquo;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>They noted, however, that&nbsp;the Miami Beach Police Department provided them with &ldquo;information last Thursday&rdquo; which &ldquo;precludes us from representing Jane Doe in the Chris Brown matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attorneys didn&#8217;t go into detail with regard to this new information, but on Instagram, Brown shared a series of text and voicemail messages that he received from the alleged victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;U knew full well I wasn&rsquo;t pressing u bout no d&ndash;k. U told me to stay and then gonna try to play me? Nah that&rsquo;s crazy i didn&rsquo;t deserve that but u def got it,&quot; the woman wrote on August 26, 2021.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just want to see you again &hellip; just let me know. If you want me to leave you alone, I will. But I really just wanna f&ndash;k the s&ndash;t again,&quot; she said in a voicemail posted on Brown&#8217;s Instagram page this week.</p>
<p>Additional texts obtained by Radar Online suggest that the woman continued to pursue a relationship with Brown several months after their initial meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missing u,&rdquo; <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/chris-brown-alleged-woman-victim-lawsuit-text-message/">she said</a> in a message sent nearly nine months after the Miami incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;U [sic] were honestly the best &#8212;- I&rsquo;ve had (eggplant emoji) lol I just want it again. Why are you playing with meee lol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Instagram, Brown promised to take legal action against his accuser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more dragging me through the mud. CLEARLY YOU CAN ALL SEE THE (blue cap emoji),&quot; the singer wrote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me and my team are taking legal action on this situation. You don&rsquo;t play with people&rsquo;s lives like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The texts speak for themselves and demonstrate that the allegations are not true. He is cooperating with the Miami Police and is preparing legal action against his accuser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;d say Brown has to admit that the world had every reason to believe his accuser over him.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the alleged victim goes by Jane Doe in the legal paperwork.</p>
<p>She states that, just over one year ago, she was on a FaceTime call with a friend who was already on board the boat in question, which was parked at Diddy&rsquo;s Star Island residence.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Doe &#8212; who is described in the lawsuit as a &quot;professional choreographer, dancer, model and musical artist&quot; &#8212; claims that Brown grabbed the phone and &quot;told her that he had heard about her music and urged her to head over to Diddy&#8217;s home on Star island as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon arriving on the yacht, the woman says that Brown took her to the boat&#8217;s kitchen and gave her a &quot;red cup with a mixed drink.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman claims Brown then &quot;offered her tips about starting a career in the music industry&quot; before filling her cup for a second time, after which she &quot;began to feel a sudden, unexplained change in consciousness.&quot;</p>
<p>She adds in the lawsuit that she felt &quot;disoriented, physically unstable, and started to fall in and out of sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>At this time, Does alleges in the complaint, Brown took her to a bedroom and sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>She claims that the artist ignored her pleas to stop, banning her from leaving the room as well.</p>
<p>After the alleged rape, the woman says that Brown grabbed her phone and texted himself so she would have his number.</p>
<p>She claims she left the yacht soon afterward, yet the singer texted her the following day and &quot;demanded&quot; that she take Plan B to &quot;terminate any possible pregnancy.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Although she was &quot;terrified and distraught,&quot; the woman says she bought the morning-after pill at a pharmacy and swallowed it.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges this victim suffered &quot;substantial, continuing, and permanent&quot; injuries as a result of the alleged sexual assault.</p>
<p>She is seeking $20 million for &quot;severe emotional distress, physical manifestations of emotional distress, emotional anguish, fear, anxiety, humiliation, depression, and other physical and emotional injuries, and damages (both economic and noneconomic)&quot; stemming from Brown&#8217;s supposed actions.</p>

<p>In the wake of these allegations going public, Brown took to his Instagram Story and fired back &#8230; as only he can.</p>
<p>&quot;I HOPE YALL SEE THIS PATTERN OF [CAP],&quot; he wrote, referencing the term for <em>lie</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever I&#8217;m releasing music or projects, &#8216;THEY&#8217; try to pull some real bulls&#8211;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown followed up the note with a photo of himself smirking, arms crossed, seemingly not a care in the world.</p>

<p>Brown, of course, admittedly assaulted then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been investigated on numerous other occasions in the past <a href="/2021/06/chris-brown-under-investigation-for-hitting-yet-another-woman/">for violence against women</a>.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Jane Doe, George Vrabeck and Ariel Mitchell, told E! News in a statement:</p>
<p>&quot;This is truly a horrific story. Our client will get justice regardless of what it takes. The justice that all victims of sexual assault deserve.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>As we all know, Chris Brown loves to allegedly beat women.</p>
<p>In a not-so-shocking turns of events, meanwhile, we&#8217;ve now learned that Brown has no real interest in beating back COVID-19.</p>
<p>Meaning what, exactly?</p>
<p>The artist doesn&#8217;t believe in taking the vaccines that have been medically proven to drastically reduce the spread and/or severity of this virus.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2048" height="1975" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021.jpg" alt="Chris Brown in 2021" class="wp-image-32141" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-300x289.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1024x988.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-768x741.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1536x1481.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-735x709.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-335x323.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-347x335.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-520x501.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-640x617.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-960x926.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/chris-brown-in-2021-1080x1042.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Not only doesn&#8217;t Brown himself believe in taking these vaccines&#8230; he&#8217;s out there applauding those who have made a very public show of their <em>own</em> vaccine dismissal.</p>
<p>Allow us to explain:</p>
<p>Kyrie Irving is one of the 20 best players in the NBA.</p>
<p>However, the point guard has refused to get vaccinated.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>And because Irving plays in Brooklyn, and because New York City has instituted vaccine requirements for anyone attending a large indoor gathering, Kyrie is NOT allowed to participate in the home games of his own team.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Nets went ahead and announced Irving wouldn&#8217;t play for the team at all this season for as long as these mandates are in place.</p>
<p>On October 12, General Manager Sean Marks released a statement explaining why. It reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the evolving nature of the situation and after thorough deliberation, we have decided Kyrie Irving will not play or practice with the team until he is eligible to be a full participant.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Concludes the message:</p>
<p><em>Kyrie has made a personal choice, and we respect his individual right to choose. </em></p>
<p><em>Currently the choice restricts his ability to be a full-time member of the team, and we will not permit any member of our team to participate with part-time availability. </em></p>
<p><em>It is imperative that we continue to build chemistry as a team and remain true to our long-established values of togetherness and sacrifice. </em></p>
<p><em>Our championship goals for the season have not changed, and to achieve these goals each member of our organization must pull in the same direction. </em></p>
<p><em>We are excited for the start of the season and look forward to a successful campaign that will make the borough of Brooklyn proud.</em></p>

<p>So, where does Brown enter the picture?</p>
<p>In the exact place you&#8217;d imagine him to do so.</p>
<p>On Instagram today, the polarizing star labeled Kyrie a &quot;real hero&quot; for taking his stance, while adding:</p>

<p>Brown, of course, was investigated this summer for reportedly <a href="/2021/06/chris-brown-under-investigation-for-hitting-yet-another-woman/">assaulting yet another woman</a>.</p>
<p>No charges will be brought against him this time around, however.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old has a well-documented history of violence, most notoriously for punching then-girlfriend Rihanna, for which he pleaded guilty to felony assault and was sentenced to probation.</p>
<p>Brown was also on the receiving end of a five-year restraining order from ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran after violently threatening her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Lizzo has become a major name in the music world largely based on the success of her track &quot;Truth Hurts.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty great jam.</p>
<p>But the artist herself is now in a bit of emotional pain after she gushed over an alleged, multiple-time woman beater and folks on social media were forced to try and reveal the truth about this violent loser.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about Chris Brown.</p>
<p><div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div></p>
<p>Lizzo, you see, is facing a grreat deal backlash after a video of the two musicians meeting backstage at a concert went viral on October 2.</p>
<p>In the footage, which was posted to Twitter, Lizzo is seen asking her fellow R&amp;B artist to pose for a picture with her after approaching him and stating plainly:</p>
<p>&quot;Because you&#8217;re my favorite person in the whole f&#8211;king world.&quot;</p>
<p>The brief and controversial exchange reportedly went down backstage during one of the Los Angeles shows of the Millennium Tour over the weekend.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Considering Brown pleaded guilty years ago to felony assault against his then-girlfriend Rihanna and considering he&#8217;s been accused numerous times since <a href="/2021/06/chris-brown-under-investigation-for-hitting-yet-another-woman/">of beating up women</a>&#8230; many critics have responded to Lizzo&#8217;s words and actions with disgust.</p>
<p>&quot;Lizzo calling Chris brown her favorite person in the whole f&#8211;king world,&quot; one fan wrote. &quot;I&#8217;M PISSED OFF MAN.&quot;</p>
<p>Another added:</p>
<p>&quot;lizzo, my baby, look at me. LOOK AT ME. this isn&#8217;t you. i know the real you. listen, it&#8217;s just me and you, okay? this isn&#8217;t you. i know you better than that. please.&quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>A third then chimed in as follows: &quot;Yuck lizzo said Chris brown is their favorite person in the world??&quot;</p>
<p>As a sad refresher:</p>
<p>In 2016, <a href="/2016/08/chris-brown-arrested-for-assault-with-a-deadly-weapon/">Brown was accused of pointing a gun</a> at a woman named Baylee Curran after she reportedly admired a piece of jewelry at his house.</p>
<p>At the time, the singer&#8217;s attorney claimed that Curran &ldquo;fabricated&rdquo; the story and Brown later said his character was being &ldquo;defaced&rdquo; by the allegation.</p>
<p>The case was eventually dismissed due to lack of evidence.</p>

<p>Lizzo, tragically, isn&#8217;t the only superstar who has openly praised Brown &#8212; despite his VERY, VERY questionable behavior over the years.</p>
<p>Justin Bieber, for example, has remained close friends with Brown, seemingly <a href="/2019/05/justin-bieber-gushes-over-chris-brown-brushes-off-rihanna-assaul/">shrugging off his assault of Rihanna</a> on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>As recently as June 14, it&#8217;s worth noting, Brown was accused of striking a woman following an alleged interaction at his Tarzana, California.</p>
<p>According to the police report, the suspect was &ldquo;not at the location&rdquo; when officers arrived on scene; and Brown and his reps have not publicly addressed the allegations.</p>

<p>Lizzo, for her part, has not yet responded to all this criticism.</p>
<p>She <em>did</em> post photos from the Millennium Tour on her Instagram, however, although she did not share the photos of her and Brown on her feed.</p>

<p>According to the woman, the slap was so violent that it made part of her weave come out.</p>
<p>Police took down a battery report.</p>
<p>In the report, Chris Brown was named as the suspect.</p>

<p>According to the report, the victim has no apparent injuries.</p>
<p>No arrest has been made at this time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t sound like this case is likely to lead to Chris Brown&#8217;s incarceration.</p>

<p><em>TMZ</em>&#8216;s sources say that this battery case will likely be handed off to teh City Attorney.</p>
<p>It is expected to be a misdemeanor charge.</p>
<p>That is, if it is anything at all.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Our justice system often leads to the (mass) incarceration of people who have harmed no one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the people who do real harm &#8212; inflicting terror and violence upon others &#8212; seem immune.</p>
<p>Any justice system that would let Chris Brown wander around freely while others rot behind bars over drugs or poverty deserves to have &quot;justice&quot; stricken from its name.</p>

<p>We are not by any means claiming that this woman&#8217;s allegations against Chris Brown are necessarily true.</p>
<p>Theoretically, anyone could make up any story, even if the stigma against accusers often makes that unlikely.</p>
<p>But no one is exactly surprised by these allegations against the disgraced rapper.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Chris Brown&#8217;s history speaks for itself.</p>
<p>In 2009, photos of Rihanna&#8217;s bruised and battered face circulated across the internet.</p>
<p>He ended up with five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counseling, and six months of community service.</p>

<p>After that mockery of our justice system, reports of violent incidents continued.</p>
<p>Not all of these reports were of domestic violence.</p>
<p>At one point, it was alleged that he had punched Frank Ocean.</p>

<p>Another time, he threw a chair at a window on the set of <em>Good Morning America</em>.</p>
<p>The &quot;reason&quot; behind his violent tantrum?</p>
<p>He had been asked about his assault on Rihanna.</p>

<p>Repeatedly, the world has gotten the distinct impression that Brown resents any mention of his crimes.</p>
<p>It would be amazing if he were as horrifed by his own evil acts as he is by people mentioning them.</p>
<p>But then, bad people never see themselves through a clear moral lens.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Since then, Chris Brown has been in numerous alleged altercations.</p>
<p>This has included violence against photographers, fellow singers, and seemingly random fans.</p>
<p>He has also been accused of threatening at least one woman with a gun.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>That gun accusation led to a standoff with police.</p>
<p>Somehow, even after barring police from entering his home, he managed to get out of trouble.</p>
<p>In part, because after hours of delaying law enforcement, they were unable to find evidence that he possessed a firearm.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Infamously, Chris Brown was also accused of domestic violence and Karrueche Tran, his now-ex girlfriend.</p>
<p>Karrueche testified at length, describing horrifying abuse during their relationship.</p>
<p>She was granted a five-year restraining order against the rapper.</p>

<p>Chris Brown has also been banned from entering multiple countries.</p>
<p>This includes the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Sadly, the United States is not yet on this list.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s one of the most reviled public figures of his time, and she&#8217;s the second-most beloved singer of the 21st century (Beyonce still exists, after all) &#8212; but somehow they make it work!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Yes, according to a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8829403/Chris-Brown-makes-cloak-dagger-late-night-visit-Adeles-west-London-home.html">new report </a>from the Daily Mail, Chris Brown paid a late-night, clandestine visit to Adele&#8217;s home in London over the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;It was all a bit cloak and dagger. He arrived in the middle of the night and didn&rsquo;t leave until around 2 am,&quot; says one insider.</p>
<p>&quot;He arrived in huge, blacked-out cars, with plenty of muscle surrounding him.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems Chris was in the UK to visit his son&nbsp;Aeko, whom he shares with ex Ammika Harris.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, Chris wore a mask while walking the streets of London, which is pretty amazing, when you think about it.</p>
<p>That means he spotted an opportunity to be an antagonistic douche, and he <em>didn&#8217;t</em> take it! Progress!</p>

<p>Anyway, no one knows what really went on with these two behind closed doors, but given that it&#8217;s 2020, we should probably assume the worst.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just gonna go ahead and brace ourselves for an engagement announcement and then be pleasantly surprised if it doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/04/adele-and-simon-konecki-its-over/">Adele finalized her divorce</a> from Simon Konecki last year, and there have been no reports of her getting involved with anyone new.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Breezy, unfortunately, has been on the prowl.</p>
<p>He<a href="/2020/01/chris-brown-threatens-to-date-newly-single-rihanna-again/"> threatened to date Rihanna</a> after she became single earlier this year.</p>
<p>And now, it seems he may have turned his attention toward Adele.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Optimists point out that Brown and Adele have been friends for several years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty bad on its own, but the upside is that Chris&#8217; visit might have been entirely platonic.</p>
<p>Sure, he slunk it late at night and left at 2 am, but if we were Chris Brown, we would travel under cover of darkness, too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to overstate how universally disliked this dude is.</p>
<p>We suppose it&#8217;s possible he likes himself, but even that seems doubtful.</p>
<p>We like to imagine he covers all the mirrors in his house to avoid looking himself in the eye.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure></div>
<p>Anyway, <a href="/2020/08/adele-flaunts-100-pound-weight-loss-in-new-pic-should-fans-be-co/">Adele lost a lot of weight</a> lately and we could see how she might be tempted to test out her new physique with a no-strings-attached shag.</p>
<p>Maybe she decided to do it with the worst person she knows to ensure that she wouldn&#8217;t wind up catching feelings.</p>
<p>Frankly, we&#8217;re just grasping at straws at this point because we can&#8217;t imagine living in a world where Adele would debase herself by dating Chris Brown.</p>
