This is not the first time that someone has published this grim announcement. And it will almost certainly happen again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time may have been a new record, as they remained separated for over a year. But how did they repeat this same mistake <em>this <\/em>time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">On his Instagram Story, Paul Staehle has often updated followers on his life. Even when he really, really shouldn&rsquo;t. (Image Credit: Instagram)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also detailed how these two so unwisely slid back into old habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Paul was in Brazil,,&rdquo; the insider detailed. The 90 Day Fiance alum, as an American with experience living in Brazil, had gotten work that required him to stay in Brazil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the source, &ldquo;Karine begged him to come back.&rdquo; She, the native Brazilian, was back in the American Midwest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">90 Day Fiance alum Karine Martins got to spend quality time during a permitted visit with sons Pierre Staehle and Ethan Staehle. (Image Credit: Instagram)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some <em>90 Day Fiance<\/em> fans are certainly kicking themselves right now, wishing that they could have somehow stopped this from happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But though Paul and Karine were dropping hints of this dark eventuality. They arguably gave us all of the clues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started last year, when Paul and Karine suddenly went from public accusations against each other to joining forces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">For years, Paul Staehle and Karine Martins have been fairly transparent on social media. Well, mostly just Paul. For better or for worse.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul and Karine decided to team up last summer. At first, it was only because of the one thing that they still had in common: their boys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, social services had &mdash; months apart, and for very different reasons &mdash; removed Pierre and Ethan from Karine, then Paul&rsquo;s custody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans may recall how Paul&rsquo;s face appeared in an unexpected place. Pierre was, briefly, a &ldquo;missing&rdquo; child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fortunately, Pierre Staehle did not remain &ldquo;missing&rdquo; for long. He was traveling in another state with his father, Paul Staehle. But his disappearance set off understandable alarm bells with CPS.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Paul and Karine hoped that they could work together to regain custody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than fighting against and badmouthing each other, they would cooperate and try to bring their boys home. To one household or the other, or even just to Paul&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house if they could.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That effort has not been a resounding success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Absolutely not! Josh Seiter and Karine Martins briefly dated, much to the chagrin of people who wanted good things for Karine.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the mean time, it appears that they both continued to date. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famously, Karine briefly dated a fame-seeking clown. Thankfully <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2022\/12\/karine-martins-and-josh-seiter-break-up-he-just-wanted-attention\/\">they broke up late last year<\/a>. He has since pursued numerous other reality TV personalities, including multiple <em>Sister Wives<\/em> stars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(And then there was the incident where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2022\/11\/paul-staehle-films-onlyfans-video-with-karines-male-cousin\/\">Paul filmed an OnlyFans video with Karine&rsquo;s male cousin<\/a>, but that&rsquo;s hardly &ldquo;dating&rdquo;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">In an interview with 90 Day Fiance blogger John Yates, Paul Staehle discussed recording an OnlyFans video with his estranged wife&rsquo;s male cousin.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, earlier this year, Paul wished a very public happy birthday to Karine. Just a year earlier, the two were actively accusing each other of some pretty nasty stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past January, Paul clarified to John Yates that he and Karine were in regular contact, but were just &ldquo;friends.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their focus, at the time, was just their custody battle. And now, tragically, they are back together. Until their next ugly breakup, we suppose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">In April of 2023, Karine Martins returned to OnlyFans. So did her once-estranged husband. They had a very specific goal in mind for any funds that they raise.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And Karine and Paul have both returned to OnlyFans. The two turned heads and made headlines a couple of years ago, posting explicit sex tapes to the adult media subscription platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, they&rsquo;re not just raising extra dough. In Touch Weekly reports that their goal is to &ldquo;help pay for lawyer fees&rdquo; as they try to regain custody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The new OnlyFans videos were recorded more recently,&rdquo; an insider reported. &ldquo;She signed documents in 2022 to approve the release of the videos. They are continuing to produce.&rdquo; So &hellip; if that&rsquo;s what you want to see, now&rsquo;s your chance. Until they break up again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\">Reading Time: <\/span> <span class=\"rt-time\"> 4<\/span> <span class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\">minutes<\/span><\/span>Ask almost any 90 Day Fiance fan, and they will happily tell you that Paul Staehle and Karine Martins both &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"disable-in-feed":false,"article-schema-type":"","disable-critical-css":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[3,2059,2057],"tags":[],"star":[2060,2058],"class_list":["post-473570","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-90-day-fiance","category-karine-martins","category-paul-staehle","star-karine-martins","star-paul-staehle"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.1 (Yoast SEO v24.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Paul Staehle and Karine Martins Are Back Together, Back on OnlyFans<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Grimly, it&#039;s no surprise that Paul Staehle and Karine Martins are back together.
