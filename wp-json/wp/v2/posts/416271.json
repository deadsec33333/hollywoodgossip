But &hellip; is that answering everyone&rsquo;s concerns?<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>Of course not &mdash; doing so, even if they were so inclined, would violate their NDA.<\/p>\r\n<p>And to be clear, viewers have real concerns.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are enough red flags on the premiere to throw a miniature parade, and we haven&rsquo;t even met all of the couples yet.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>One of the hottest topics among fans is <a href=\"\/videos\/bilal-hazziez-tests-shaeeda-sween-90-day-fiance-fans-see-huge-re\/\">Bilal Hazziez and Shaeeda Sween<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>While they&rsquo;re absolutely right about an unprecedented story, thankfully the main focus of fan commentary isn&rsquo;t bigotry.<\/p>\r\n<p>(And let&rsquo;s face it, while racism and Islamophobia are definitely issues, the <em>90 Day Fiance<\/em> fandom specifically tends to hate women more than anything else)<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>First up, they became engaged after spending only seven days together in person.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s hardly a record for the show (that would be Robert and Anny&rsquo;s eight hours), but it&rsquo;s very fast, even after an online relationship.<\/p>\r\n<p>How well can you know someone after so little time together? These two will find out.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>Bilal has also set up an elaborate test for Shaeeda after hiding his wealth and lifestyle from her.<\/p>\r\n<p>As he told his sister, his plan was to drive a well-used work van to pick up Shaeeda and then drive her to his childhood home.<\/p>\r\n<p>Would this test weed out a gold digger? Maybe. Is lying to your future spouse a terrible basis for a relationship? Absolutely.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>Up next are Kara and Guillermo, for whom the problems so far seem to only be logistical.<\/p>\r\n<p>Because Guillermo is essentially a refugee from Venezuela, having witnessed fellow protesters being slaughtered by police gunfire, his passport is expired.<\/p>\r\n<p>Later this season, they&rsquo;ll have more personal issues, but whether the red flag is Kara having cheated (in high school!) or Guillermo&rsquo;s fixation on it &hellip; only time will tell.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>For Emily and Kobe, there are a lot of potential issues, from how much time has passed to Emily&rsquo;s history of less-than-stellar judgment to a potential new pregnancy.<\/p>\r\n<p>The promos for the season make it clear that Emily may have ignored her parents&rsquo; advice about using birth control to avoid having another child too early.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, Kobe seems to express weird insecurities about Emily breastfeeding, complaining that he doesn&rsquo;t want to \"share\" with his own child. That&rsquo;s not inspiring.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>Finally, so far, we have Jibri and Miona, whom we already know married in Serbia some time ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>On the surface, they have many of the issues that Emily and Kobe do, namely that Jibri seems to be impulsive and not always listen to good advice.<\/p>\r\n<p>He and Miona are arguing about where they will live (or rather, how soon they will leave South Dakota), but that&rsquo;s not the biggest red flag.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>Miona appears to be a white woman from eastern Europe, yet is shown with varying levels of brown skin in photos.<\/p>\r\n<p>Maybe some of it is tan, but a lot of it looks like makeup.<\/p>\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s not the same as blackface or like the racial slurs used by Mike Berk or Alina Kasha, viewers are accusing Miona of blackfishing.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>Blackfishing, a play on the word \"catfishing,\" involves altering one&rsquo;s appearance to seem more racially ambiguous or even to appear Black, usually when one is white.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Kardashians are infamous for this, and it&rsquo;s a pernicious trend among many influencers (both actual and aspiring).<\/p>\r\n<p>Particularly troubling is that Miona is married to a Black man, Jibri. Will he or his mother discuss this on the show? We sure hope so.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\">Reading Time: <\/span> <span class=\"rt-time\"> 6<\/span> <span class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\">minutes<\/span><\/span>On Sunday, Season 9 of 90 Day Fiance premiered, introducing viewers to several new couples.
