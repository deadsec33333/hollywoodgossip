And the only actress from that show we wanna see in the buff is <a href=\"\/2007\/03\/jennifer-love-hewitt-abreast-of-a-new-ad-campaign\/\">Jennifer Love Hewitt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Lacey has grown up. Just read what she has to say in an interview with <em>Maxim<\/em> below:<\/p>\n<p><strong>In your new movie, you&rsquo;re being terrorized by a maniac who&rsquo;s been locked in an attic. Do you survive?<\/strong><br>\nI can&rsquo;t say. But I do have one really cool scene where I go under the house to reset the circuit breaker and he chases me. I&rsquo;m crawling through the mud on my stomach, trying to get away, and I have mud in my eyes, in my teeth, up my nose&hellip;I was sneezing mud for two days after that.<br><strong><br>\nSexy. Is there a horror flick that scarred you for life?<\/strong><br>\nChucky really freaked me out. At the time my little brother had one of those My Buddy dolls that looked just like Chucky [sort of like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanidolworship.com\/2007\/04\/american-idol-look-alike-clay-aiken-and-chucky\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clay Aiken<\/a> does]. My sisters would torture us with it. They&rsquo;d prop him up at night with a butter knife in his arm so he&rsquo;d be sitting there like that when we woke up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve grown up a lot since <em>Party of Five<\/em>. What was it like being an awkward teen on national television?<\/strong><br>\nI had to go through everything on that show &ndash; my first kiss, my first bra. I was 11 when it started and a late bloomer. They wrote an episode about how I&rsquo;m changing in the locker room in junior high and all the other girls have bras, but I&rsquo;m just in a little undershirt, so I get a Wonderbra and stuff it. I had a fitting to figure out what they&rsquo;d stuff my bra with &ndash; tissue, silicone, padding. For a week everyone analyzed how I looked with boobs and said maybe I should grow some one day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looks like you took that advice to heart.<\/strong><br>\nYeah, when they finally arrived, they came with a vengeance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your character on the show, Claudia, was such a goody two-shoes. Did you ever want her to cut loose?<\/strong><br>\nIn the last two seasons, I was drinking and smoking, all those teen things. There was one scene where I was supposed to be drunk, and in the hair-and-makeup trailer beforehand they gave me a glass of red wine. I was 17, and I&rsquo;m pretty strait-laced, so I&rsquo;d never had a drink before. I held my nose and just downed it. I got so drunk I couldn&rsquo;t remember my dialogue. After the scene everyone applauded! I don&rsquo;t think anyone knew the truth. I actually got sick the next day just from that and haven&rsquo;t cared for alcohol since.<\/p>\n<p>* <em>The Hollywood Gossip note<\/em>: Sort of like her <em>Mean Girls<\/em> co-star, <a href=\"\/2007\/04\/lindsay-lohan-denies-letting-kevin-federline-hit-that\/\">Lindsay Lohan<\/a>. Only the exact opposite.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s a shame. Do you have any vices at all?<\/strong><br>\nI&rsquo;m really bad about not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whoa, reckless!<\/strong><br>\nThey call it the California roll, because instead of coming to a full stop you just slow down to, like, five miles per hour and then keep rolling through. But I&rsquo;ve only gotten one ticket in my life, for an illegal U-turn. There was nobody on the road&hellip;except for a cop on a motorcycle right behind me.<br><strong><br>\nDo you get that kind of attention when you go back home to Mississippi?<\/strong><br>\nIt&rsquo;s more relaxing there. You can go to a coffee shop in your sweatpants and no one cares. Though everyone in my hometown thinks Hollywood is so small. They think I live next door to J.Lo and hang out with <a href=\"\/2007\/04\/bar-refaeli-leonardo-dicaprio-deny-pregnancy-rumors\/\">Leonardo DiCaprio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who would want to hang out with that guy?<\/strong><br>\nHe was the first person who ever made me completely speechless. I had a huge crush on him when I was 14. I was coming back to the Four Seasons after the premiere of my first movie, <em>Lost in Space<\/em>, and he was in the elevator. I was silent all the way up to the 18th floor. When he got out I started crying, I was so overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>* <em>The Hollywood Gossip note<\/em>: So is <a href=\"\/2007\/03\/the-hollywood-gossip-rumor-mill-leonardo-dicaprio-proposes-to-bar-refaeil\/\">Bar Refaeli<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aside from being Leonardo DiCaprio, how can a guy impress you?<\/strong><br>\nThe true test is if he&rsquo;s willing to go shopping with me. Will you go shopping, and will you hold the purse while I&rsquo;m looking around and trying stuff on? He should be interactive and make comments, too, rather than reiterating how bored he is.<br><strong><br>\nWould a pickup line ever work on you?<\/strong><br>\nAt least be creative. None of this, &ldquo;That shirt will really look good on my floor,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;All those curves and no brakes?&rdquo; Somebody said that to me in Target. I was like, &ldquo;First of all, we&rsquo;re in Target. Second of all, that&rsquo;s so cheesy!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh, though.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/2007\/04\/lacey-chabert-the-naughty-maxim-interview\/lovely-lacey\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6782\" title=\"Lovely Lacey\"><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\">Reading Time: <\/span> <span class=\"rt-time\"> 3<\/span> <span class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\">minutes<\/span><\/span>Forgive us for being grossed out over the idea of Lacey Chabert nude.
