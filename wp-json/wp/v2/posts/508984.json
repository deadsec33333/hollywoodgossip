The question is, will he be a divorced man twice over.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a shocking Instagram post, the Foo Fighters rocker admitted to the world that he had cheated on his wife of over 20 years. To make matters worse, the affair resulted in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2024\/09\/dave-grohls-secret-baby-affair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">love child<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story perhaps sounds familiar to those who have followed Dave&rsquo;s career since his Nirvana days. For the rest of us, it&rsquo;s worth explaining that Dave Grohl knows exactly what happens when you cheat on a spouse: divorce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much of his <a data-wpil-monitor-id=\"420\" href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2024\/06\/terrence-howard-divorced-marriage-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marital history<\/a> is about to repeat itself?

That&rsquo;s the year Dave Grohl married his first wife, Jennifer Youngblood.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her last name kind of says it all. At the time, Dave was only 25 years old. He was still with Nirvana and his friend, Kurt Cobain, had just died.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In later years, Dave admitted in interviews that he was far too <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2020\/10\/jinger-duggar-reveals-how-michelle-bribes-the-kids-to-marry-youn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"418\">young to get married<\/a>. That&rsquo;s probably why they split in 1997.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s far from the end of the story.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are conflicting reports as to why the two split, with one prevailing theory being that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2007\/sep\/14\/popandrock.foofighters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">he cheated<\/a> on her. For his part, Dave insisted that the split was amicable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I was 25, my wife was even younger. We weren&rsquo;t ready to get married,&rdquo; he once told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nme.com\/photos\/the-wisdom-of-dave-grohl-1417857\">NME<\/a>. &ldquo;I miss her a ton, she&rsquo;s the funniest goddamn weirdo you ever met in your life.

The split apparently was the breaking point for Pat, who already was feeling touring fatigue and was at odds with Dave on how he was controlling the group.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was just so sick of it. I was just so sick of the whole thing,&rdquo; Smear recalled in the documentary <em>Foo Fighters: Back and Forth<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &ldquo;I [didn&rsquo;t] want to go out on another bazillion show tour and I don&rsquo;t care.

They welcomed three children, all girls, and Dave appeared to a doting dad even when he was out on tour.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I used to tour nine months out of the year.

Yes, Dave admitted to an affair in a short, but shocking statement on Instagram.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C_v4WBbyxnd\/\">wrote on Instagram<\/a> Tuesday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the question is, will his second marriage end in divorce like his first?

Clearly, ending his marriage&nbsp;of 21 years is on the table, according a source who spoke to <em><a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/dave-grohl-retained-divorce-lawyer-before-revealing-he-welcomed-baby-outside-marriage-source-exclusive-8710296?hid=1d3875d01f2e5887390aff28f958bfa5227efa3a&amp;did=14523820-20240911&amp;utm_source=ppl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=ppl-news_newsletter&amp;utm_content=091124&amp;lctg=1d3875d01f2e5887390aff28f958bfa5227efa3a&amp;lr_input=49bbb90ef70860c6d66c2236fcc42d2553a87206d049dc89dd6f450cda855393&amp;utm_term=midday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PEOPLE<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there&rsquo;s no word yet on Jordyn and if she&rsquo;s doing the same. It might be that Dave prepared for the worst from his wife &ndash; a demand for a divorce &ndash; before actually telling her the horrible truth.  And for good reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Dave knew his infidelity could end in divorce,&rdquo; says an insider who spoke to InTouch. &ldquo;And if that happens, Jordyn will be one very <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intouchweekly.com\/posts\/dave-grohls-wife-will-be-very-rich-if-divorce-happens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rich woman<\/a>.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It remains unclear whether the couple signed a prenup agreement before tying the knot in 2003. However, the Nirvana drummer has reportedly amassed an estimated $330 million fortune, and if there isn&rsquo;t a prenup written in his favor&hellip;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Dave&rsquo;s nervous,&rdquo; admits the insider. &ldquo;He wants to get ahead of the game because if Jordyn decides not to forgive him, she could easily end up walking away with half of everything.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>History does have a funny way of repeating itself, huh? <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\">Reading Time: <\/span> <span class=\"rt-time\"> 4<\/span> <span class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\">minutes<\/span><\/span>Dave Grohl is a divorced man.
