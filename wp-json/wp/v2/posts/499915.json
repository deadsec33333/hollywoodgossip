They later welcomed a second child, daughter Lola Jade, in April 2013. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blake and Sarah were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biography.com\/musicians\/a60717682\/amy-winehouse-husband-blake-fielder-civil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reportedly married and divorced<\/a>, though actual dates have been kept private making it difficult to piece together a timeline of their relationship. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In August 2012, one year after Amy&rsquo;s untimely death, Blake was found choking in bed by Sarah, as originally reported by <em>The Guardian.<\/em> Blake was <a href=\"https:\/\/theguardian.com\/music\/2012\/aug\/09\/amy-winehouse-ex-husband-coma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">put in a medically induced <\/a>coma after suffering multiple organ failure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Sarah alleged that Blake must have ingested an &ldquo;illicit&rdquo; substance during a night out drinking with friends. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, Blake recovered from the terrifying incident and claimed he has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/tv\/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sober &ldquo;for years&rdquo;<\/a> as recently as April 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for romantic relationships, Amy&rsquo;s ex-husband was reported to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-sun.com\/entertainment\/3345659\/amy-winehouses-ex-blake-fielder-civil-engaged\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engaged once again<\/a>, this time to singer Bay Wright in June 2021.

Her sophomore album, also titled &ldquo;Back to Black,&rdquo; went double platinum in under a year.

Blake claimed he had a right to the money because he was with Amy for six years, including their marriage from 2007 to 2009, during which her music made her an international celebrity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit was unsuccessful. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-amy-winehouse-s-ex-husband-defends-new-biopic\">Amy Winehouse&rsquo;s Ex-Husband Defends New Biopic<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blake recently revealed that he has watched &ldquo;Back to Black,&rdquo; directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson.
