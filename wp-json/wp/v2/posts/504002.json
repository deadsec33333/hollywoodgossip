By the time viewers reached the wedding day finale, it was hard to really say who was going to make it to the altar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the finale, it looked like seven couples are ready to give love a shot sight unseen, but after everyone&rsquo;s getaway to Mexico, the romances started dropping like flies!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexandra Byrd and Tim Godbee, Monica Davis and Stephen Richardson, and Hannah Jiles and Nick Dorka all jumped ship, so to speak, and decided not to get together in the end.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That left Marissa George and Ramses Prashad, Taylor Krause and Garrett Josemans, and, Tyler Francis and Ashley Adionser the only couples on the path to saying &ldquo;I do&rdquo;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two couples made it, one did not. And the one that didn&rsquo;t SHOCKED fans to their core.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marissa and Ramses, fan favorites from the get-go, decided at the last minute not to get married. While Marissa was happy to stay engaged, Ramses unexpectedly walked away from their relationship all together, leaving her devastated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should&rsquo;ve come to this experience,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;How could I feel so sure? And you&rsquo;re not? It sucks, I want you to choose me,&rdquo; adding of their split, &ldquo;This is the worst day of my life.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-visiting-a-new-city\">Visiting A New City<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other interesting twists of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2024\/03\/love-is-blind-reunion-8-bombshells-from-the-season-6-reunion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Love Is Blind<\/a><\/em> season seven was that the show called the Washington, DC metro area home. And on an election year &mdash; yikes! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creator <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vulture.com\/article\/love-is-blind-season-7-chris-coelen-lawsuits-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chris Coelen revealed season seven&rsquo;s location<\/a> during an in-depth interview with <em>Vulture<\/em> MONTHS before the season aired. It was the first time Netflix had allowed so much information about an upcoming season to be divulged!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the DC area as its background, it was no surprise to watch as politics came up in the pods. As usual, talking about politics didn&rsquo;t help secure any romantic connections. In fact, in terms of Marissa and Ramses, it was their political views that was partially to blame for their split. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Vulture&rsquo;s<\/em> own Kathryn VanArendonk witnessed a few pod dates get &ldquo;derailed&rdquo; by the subject, writing: &ldquo;A handsome consultant type describes himself as &lsquo;a patriot,&rsquo; and although he can&rsquo;t see it, the woman across from him winces.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember who that was?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fans-knew-what-they-were-getting-into-and-what-s-coming-next\">Fans Knew What They Were Getting Into &ndash; And What&rsquo;s Coming Next!  <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While creator Chris Coelen revealed <em>Love Is Blind <\/em>season seven was being filmed in Washington, DC, it&rsquo;s possible another season could also be in the works. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One eagle eyed Redditor shared video of what appears to be another group of <em>Love Is Blind<\/em> fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix\/comments\/1bdiwdr\/season_7_spoiler\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">preparing to film their search<\/a> for wedding gowns. The group of unidentified people were spotted outside Beloved Bridal in Stillwater, Minnesota &mdash; just outside of St. Paul\/Minneapolis area. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the reality series, every season features an episode where all of the brides-to-be gather to try on wedding dresses. At the same time, the grooms-to-be are usually doing their suit shopping with their own loved ones. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey usually make an appearance at each location for the special occasion. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@sarahhorsman3\/video\/7345131517041167662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">original video was posted to TikTok<\/a> where fans debated the location&rsquo;s season status in the comments. Many believe that Minnesota will be home to the eighth season of &ldquo;Love Is Blind,&rdquo; following Washington, DC. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-love-is-blind-s-controversial-cast-members\">&lsquo;Love Is Blind&rsquo;s Controversial Cast Members <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the show&rsquo;s rise in popularity is a rise in controversy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent being that a couple of season six &ldquo;Love Is Blind&rdquo; cast members were not on the show for the right reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeramey Lutinski was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glamour.com\/story\/love-is-blind-season-6-secret-partners-backlash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed to have been engaged<\/a> just a few weeks prior to entering the &ldquo;Love Is Blind&rdquo; pods, as reported by Glamour. Not only did he later confirm the broken engagement, Jeramey claimed he told his &ldquo;Love Is Blind&rdquo; cast mates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Anybody that I was on dates with, my cast mates, and in multiple interviews, this topic was discussed,&rdquo; Jeramey <a href=\"https:\/\/ew.com\/love-is-blind-season-6-jeramey-confirms-he-was-engaged-before-filming-8599459\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">explained in a video<\/a> on Instagram. He added that any footage of him explaining his engagement didn&rsquo;t make the &ldquo;final cut.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Trevor Sova was still in a relationship while filming the show. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several texts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C3rQegWL-Yn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">between Trevor and his then-girlfriend<\/a> were revealed on Reality Ashley&rsquo;s Instagram, one of which shows Trevor saying &ldquo;no matter what&rdquo; he was &ldquo;not getting married.&rdquo; <\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-504774\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-960x640.jpg 960w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\"><\/noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-504774 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-960x640.jpg 960w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2024\/07\/GettyImages-1908156276.jpg\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Renee Poche attends the Allstate Party at the Playoff hosted by ESPN &amp; College Football Playoff at POST Houston on January 06, 2024 in Houston, Texas. <span class=\"image-caption-credit\"> (Photo by Marcus Ingram\/Getty Images for ESPN)<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-netflix-sued-by-former-love-is-blind-cast\">Netflix Sued By Former &lsquo;Love Is Blind&rsquo; Cast <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to shady cast members,<em> Love Is Blind<\/em> has been battling a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2024\/01\/love-is-blind-lawsuits-allege-abuse-sexual-assault-on-set-will-netflix-series-come-to-an-end\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">concerning lawsuit<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Season five&rsquo;s Renee Poche is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/entertainment\/tv\/2024\/01\/04\/renee-poche-love-is-blind-netflix-lawsuit\/72101776007\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">currently suing the show<\/a>, claiming that they intentionally inflicted &ldquo;emotional distress,&rdquo; according to USA Today.
