Brooks sided with the prosecution.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>He said he found there was \"well more than sufficient evidence\" for the trial to go on as planned.<\/p>\r\n<p>The judge also said the evidence presented by the prosecution satisfied the conditions to move forward and stated that there was \"a plethora of evidence here to suggest a reasonable jury from which they could find there was possession.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>The defense&rsquo;s motion to acquit was therefore denied<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>During a four-hour cross-examination late last week Fottrell explained what he found on Duggar&rsquo;s work computer.<\/p>\r\n<p>He pointed to cached data and thumbnails auto-created when files are downloaded and accessed.<\/p>\r\n<p>That data, he said, proved illegal photos and videos had once existed on this device.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>It was \"forensically challenging\" to do establish this, he admitted under oath.<\/p>\r\n<p>But not impossible.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Some offenders understand it&rsquo;s dangerous to possess the material of this nature so they download it, view it and then delete it,\" versus amassing a library, Fottrell said.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>He addded that he had found full-sized originals of one lewd collection of photographs in a part of the hard drive that retains deleted files.<\/p>\r\n<p>While&nbsp;Fottrell was called to testify to technical details that allegedly proved Josh&rsquo;s guilt, the prosecution wrapped up its case by calling upon Bobye Holt.<\/p>\r\n<p>A former very close family friend of the Duggars,&nbsp;Holt said she was present in March 2003 when <a href=\"\/2021\/12\/josh-duggar-trial-bobye-holt-closes-prosecutions-case-says-josh\/\">Josh confessed to the molestation<\/a> of a five-year old.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image placeholder-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><\/figure><\/div>\r\n<p>Just like she did at a pre-trial heating, Holt swore that Duggar said back then that he groped this child under her shirt and under her pants while she sat on his lap, reading the bible.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"You don&rsquo;t forget something like that. It completely impacted our families,\" said Holt.<\/p>\r\n<p>She added that her daughter was dating Josh at the time of this incident.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>In April, Josh was arrested on one count of receipt of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography.<\/p>\r\n<p>The case stemmed from a 2019 raid on his office; the 19 Kids and Counting alum pleaded not guilty the next day in court.<\/p>\r\n<p>Josh was later released from jail to his designated third-party custodians, family friends Lacount and Maria Reber.<\/p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\r\n<p>He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted on both of these charges, for which the state has presented a strong case.<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, he is innocent until proven guilty and now has his chance to establish reasonable doubt in front of the jury.<\/p>\r\n<p>The trial is expected to conclude in a couple of days.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\">Reading Time: <\/span> <span class=\"rt-time\"> 4<\/span> <span class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\">minutes<\/span><\/span>Give&nbsp;Josh Duggar an A for effort, we guess.
