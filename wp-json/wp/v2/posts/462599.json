(Photo via Instagram)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coroner&rsquo;s report will likely corroborate the prevailing theory that Carter&rsquo;s death was the result of a multiple drug toxicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is 2022, which means that thousands of internet randos feel the need to offer their own theories about how Aaron died.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many believe that Carter took his own life, despite the fact that there&rsquo;s zero evidence to support those claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>The circumstances surrounding the death of Aaron Carter remain mysterious. Now, a close friend of Aaron&rsquo;s is offering new insights. (Photo via Instagram)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, an even more baseless and damaging claim is making the rounds on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tmz.com\/2022\/11\/11\/aaron-carter-fiancee-melanie-martin-harassment\/\">new report<\/a> from TMZ, a growing contingent of Aaron&rsquo;s fans are convinced that the singer was murdered by his on-again, off-again fianc&eacute;e, Melanie Martin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melanie and Aaron&rsquo;s relationship was notoriously contentious, and both parties struggled with addiction and mental health issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Melanie Martin made a last-ditch effort to save Aaron Carter during the singer&rsquo;s final days. Alas, she was too late. (Photo via Instagram)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there&rsquo;s zero evidence that she had anything to do with his death, and Martin was <em>not<\/em> in the house at the time of Carter&rsquo;s passing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped social media users from hurling wildly dangerous accusations at the mother of Aaron&rsquo;s infant son.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling it, Melanie murdered Aaron,&rdquo; wrote one Twitter user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;She texted him days ago saying &lsquo;you&rsquo;re going to die&rsquo; and days ago Aaron called her Voldemort. Today Melanie posts on social media a vid of her crying while driving! Who does that??? Suspicious!&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Melanie paid the housekeeper to kill Aaron,&rdquo; another added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to news that Martin requested a police escort to protect her while she retrieved items she had left behind in Aaron&rsquo;s house, several conspiracy theorists accused her of suspicious behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><figcaption>Melanie Martin is in mourning. She shared this photo as a tribute to the late singer Aaron Carter. (Photo via Instagram)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The irony of the situation is that Melanie was reportedly working tirelessly to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehollywoodgossip.com\/2022\/11\/aaron-carter-heres-how-his-ex-fiancee-nearly-saved-his-life\/\">try and save Aaron&rsquo;s life<\/a> in the weeks leading up to his death, and she succeeded in convincing him to participate in an outpatient rehab program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the people accusing her of murder are receiving a good deal of pushback from more level-headed observers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is disgusting you should be ashamed,&rdquo; one Twitter user argued in response to an allegation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;She was begging him to get sober otherwise &lsquo;you&rsquo;re going to die&rsquo; as in he would OD if he didn&rsquo;t stop and she was begging for her child&rsquo;s father to live. You just spit in the face of every Addicts partner or parent.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometime in the next few weeks, Aaron&rsquo;s official cause of death will be made public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, we encourage all who feel compelled to comment on the situation to bear in mind that his loved ones are grieving human beings going through a very difficult time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"span-reading-time rt-reading-time\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rt-label rt-prefix\">Reading Time: <\/span> <span class=\"rt-time\"> 3<\/span> <span class=\"rt-label rt-postfix\">minutes<\/span><\/span>It&rsquo;s been almost a week since Aaron Carter was found dead in the bathroom of his Lancaster, California home.
