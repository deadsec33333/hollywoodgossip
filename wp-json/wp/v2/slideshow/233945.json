Channing Tatum celebrates his first father&rsquo;s day with his wife and his baby girl, and it&rsquo;s adorable. <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Showed Off His Best Vogue Moves<br>This guy pulled off seven classic dance movies in 30 seconds, from Vogue and the robot to the funky chicken. Because why not?<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Was a Mama&rsquo;s Boy<br>This is a guy who loves his mom, and isn&rsquo;t afraid to show it. He posted this pic on Instragram for Mother&rsquo;s Day, with a quote from Abraham Lincoln: &ldquo;All that I am or ever hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.&rdquo; He followed that with, &ldquo;She has put up with a lot over the years. Wow. Don&rsquo;t know how we got to be here mama. But I know it&rsquo;s cause of you. I be lovin you.&rdquo;<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Supported National Puppy Day<br>Channing Tatum joined other celebrities to help promote adoption for National Puppy Day by posing with this adorable puppy. Talk about cuteness overload.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Admitted How Much He Loves Stripping<br>Was there anything better than the time Channing Tatum went on Saturday Night Live and admitted he loved stripping in the opening monologue? <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Danced Like This:<br>I mean, seriously. Was Channing Tatum ever more perfect than when he was on Magic Mike? Yeah, we didn&rsquo;t think so either.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Shared a Beer With a Horse<br>Channing Tatum loves his horse so much, he&rsquo;s clearly willing to share anything. Even a beer. How&rsquo;s that for bonding with a favorite pet?<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Went to the Rain Forest<br>Channing Tatum was inspired on a trip to the Ecuadorian Rain Forest, and has been working with the Runa Foundation as a way to give back. <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Channeled Beyonce<br>This was probably the most epic Lip Sync Battle ever. Tatum competed against his wife, who channeled her inner Magic Mike. But Tatum brought out all the stops for his performance of &ldquo;Run the World (Girls).&rdquo;<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Took the Cutest Anniversary Photos With Jenna<br>Channing Tatum and his wife are basically the cutest couple on the planet, and the photos they posted on their 7-year anniversary prove it. <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Did Kid Theater with Jimmy Fallon<br>On Jimmy Fallon, Channing Tatum read scenes from &ldquo;Magic Mike,&rdquo; but not the one you&rsquo;re thinking of. This version was written by a child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like regular Mike, but Magic!&rdquo; is just one of the lines from the skit. This guys really is a good sport.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Was a Sailor<br>Who makes a better tap-dancing sailor than Channing Tatum on &lsquo;Hail Caesar&rsquo;? No one. Absolutely no one. <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That Time He Made us Cry<br>It&rsquo;s one thing to watch Channing Tatum show off his moves in the Magic Mike movies, but it&rsquo;s another when he gets emotional on screen. <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From his roles on films such as Step Up and She&rsquo;s the Man to Dear John and Magic Mike, Channing &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":25,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3705],"star":[3706],"class_list":["post-233945","slideshow","type-slideshow","status-publish","hentry","category-channing-tatum","star-channing-tatum"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v24.1 (Yoast SEO v24.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>13 Times Channing Tatum Was Basically Perfect - The Hollywood Gossip<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"From his roles on films such as Step Up and She&#039;s the Man to Dear John and Magic Mike, Channing Tatum has won the hearts of many.
