Like it&rsquo;s not a much better show than Modern Family, which hasn&rsquo;t really been funny in years?<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>The Americans<br>Like Modern Family, House of Cards continues to receive nominations just&hellip; because? Because it&rsquo;s been around for awhile? The Americans is probably the best show on TV.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Orange is the New Black<br>Orange is the New Black also deserved a spot (in Best Drama) over Westworld, which may air on HBO, but which focuses way too much on its mysteries over its character development.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Justin Theroux, The Leftovers<br>Look, we all adore Anthony Hopkins. He&rsquo;s a legend. And he did not put on a better performance in Westworld than Justin Theroux did on Season 3 of The Leftovers.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Fargo<br>She was the only reason to keep watching Fargo Season 3. We&rsquo;d have included her over Judy Davis from FEUD.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>American Crime<br>We all adore FX. But it&rsquo;s a&hellip;. well&hellip; crime that FEUD was nominated for Best Limited Series over American Crime.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Vera Farmiga, Bates Motel<br>We&rsquo;re gonna pick on House of Cards again. The Bates Model star deserved a nod over Robin Wright. Just look at that photo above!<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Rachel Bloom, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend<br>She won a Golden Globe, which is pretty amazing, really. But Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is more creative, original and funnier than about 98 percent of what&rsquo;s on TV. She should be in. Jane Fonda should be out.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Michael McKean, Better Call Saul<br>Who knew this comedic actor could be so dramatic? And affecting?!? The way he made us hate him totally deserved recognition over Ron Cephas Jones from This Is Us.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>The Good Place<br>We&rsquo;re a bit on the fence over this one, but we&rsquo;d put it in Best Comedy over Master of None only because it&rsquo;s funnier. Master of None isn&rsquo;t really a comedy. The point when watching a sitcom is to laugh, right?<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Aubrey Plaza, Legion<br>She scared the ish out of us on this FX drama. Can we start a petition to get her included over Thandie Newton?<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Carrie Coon, The Leftovers<br>This one is easy: she should replace Carrie Coon from Fargo! (Yes, we know those roles are nominated in different categories. But still.)<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>13 Reasons Why<br>Couldn&rsquo;t they have made up a Most Controversial Show category for this year only, just to at least recognize the conversation around this Netflix drama?<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We now know which shows and stars have been nominated for Emmy Awards in 2017.
