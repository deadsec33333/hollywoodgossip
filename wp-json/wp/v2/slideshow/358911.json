The new season begins with several shots of Caleb jogging shirtless in Arizona. Some viewers already have their fingers crossed that he&rsquo;ll be one of the cast members who launches an OnlyFans.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>So who is Caleb?<br>He has done a lot of traveling and has lived internationally. He has also done some extensive self-discovery, tapping into his spiritual side. At one point, production got him explaining (awkwardly) how he felt about himself feeling almost &ldquo;alien&rdquo; through extensive self-examination, but editors were kind enough to leave in the part where he then laughs after realizing how that sounds.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>But Caleb has gotten very spiritual<br>He does a tarot spread on camera, determining that the cards may be commenting on his future with Alina &mdash; one that he hopes will be a bright one.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Caleb and Alina go way back<br>When they were both about 14, Caleb and Alina struck up a friendship on social media. Of course, this was like 2007, so this was on Facebook. They eventually fell out of touch, only reconnecting when Caleb was planning a trip to Russia, checked a dating app for the area, and found that his childhood friend was on it. <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Now adults at very different places in their lives, they reconnected<br>This time, even though the pandemic prevented that trip to Russia from happening, things took a turn for the romantic.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Meanwhile, in Russia<br>Alina is modeling a jaw-dropping burlesque look. Burlesque is a recent interest of hers, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know it from the photoshoot.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Gas her up!<br>Genuinely, this is a fantastic look for Alina, and it&rsquo;s not hard to see why her reconnection with Caleb so quickly took a turn for the romantic.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Meet Alina!<br>Like Caleb, she is 27. Alina has diastrophic dysplasia, which is a rare form of dwarfism that is often accompanied by numerous complications and can sometimes require multiple surgeries. <\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Her friends are there to support her<br>This is a good thing for her, but it&rsquo;s also a great introduction to them &mdash; because it looks like Elijah is going to be a larger part of this season.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>She&rsquo;s also in a band<br>With her friends, Alina is in a band with some very raunchy lyrics. Gotta be honest, I&rsquo;m already obsessed with this couple&rsquo;s storyline. This was the moment for me when I knew that they&rsquo;ll probably be my favorite for the season.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Alina&rsquo;s disability impacts her life, by definition<br>She can still go places and drive, but she does need certain accessibility options. Her fingers have limited flexibility, she can only walk for a limited amount of time before becoming tired. But she is excited and eager to see Caleb and to make this happen &mdash; even if it means going to Turkey, their only viable option since the borders are closed.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Alina breaks the news to her parents<br>They are instantly worried. Alina explains to the camera that she has a sister who is of average height, who is also babied by her parents, but she does feel that she gets even more of this treatment despite being a grown woman.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>They worry &hellip; because she&rsquo;s been heartbroken before<br>Years ago, a South African man met up with Alina in Russia and the two had a strong connection. But when she later went to South Africa, he made excuses and never met up with her. It&rsquo;s not clear what caused this (for all that we know, he could have been married, or he could be a &ldquo;chaser&rdquo; who didn&rsquo;t want his friends to know) but Alina was heartbroken and devastated as a result.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Back in Arizona &hellip;<br>Caleb is drawing out his intentions for his relationship in a spiritual practice, drawing on a sheet of paper while seated by the fire. He wants to connect with Alina.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Later, the two talk<br>Alina tells Caleb that she has concerns about accessibility options in Turkey (concerns also raised by her parents), so her friend Elijah &mdash; who is also her roommate &mdash; will be tagging along to help her with things like light switches and other things in the hotel that may be out of reach. Caleb is initially unsure, because this feels like an awkward third wheel situation, but he emphasizes that it&rsquo;s important for him that Alina feel comfortable.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda<br>51-year-old auto engineer Gino is from Michigan. Jasmine is from Panama. These two are already shaping up to be a must-watch couple, but for very different reasons than Caleb and Alina.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Oh no<br>One of our earliest moments in the episode is seeing Gino go shopping (at a physical store, if you can imagine) for toiletries and a few other basic essentials while he prepares for his trip to see Jasmine. Before we make fun of him for the possibly generational decision to shop in person, this may have been a favor to a friend or something. We cannot explain why Gino would ask if there is &ldquo;lotion for couples&rdquo; like this.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Gino lets the cameras follow him on his daily routine<br>Some parts of this are unfair &mdash; the camera chooses to focus on Gino eating frozen dinners. Other parts are a little different, in that we&rsquo;re unsure of why Gino didn&rsquo;t tidy up his kitchen counters before filming. You get the &ldquo;Male Living Space&rdquo; vibe here, and there&rsquo;s a feeling of inescapable loneliness. It&rsquo;s not that everyone who lives alone is lonely, but Gino feels lonely. He reveals that his ex-wife was Brazilian and that the two of them were together for seven years.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Gino&rsquo;s focus is on Jasmine<br>He says that he fell for her on the first day that they were talking, which is intense. The editors chose to double down on showing Gino&rsquo;s physical attraction to Jasmine, highlighting photos of her as he describes her, though he also emphasizes how much he admires the intelligence of his English Lit teacher girlfriend.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Seriously, he finds her very sexy<br>Because of how deeply horny their relationship is &mdash; yes, they have (of course) been naked on video &mdash; Gino hopes to use some &ldquo;little blue pills&rdquo; to keep up with her.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>But &hellip;<br>As Gino sort of confesses to his brother, he has never actually shown Jasmine his head without his hat. He&rsquo;s not the only bald man in his family, but it clearly impacts his self-image, so he always wears a hat. He does say that Jasmine knows that he will literally always wear a hat unless he is sleeping.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>More slice of life &hellip;<br>Gino takes Jasmine with him, so to speak, as he leaves the house to pick up food, explaining to the camera that Jasmine likes to keep tabs on his whereabouts when he leaves the house &hellip; even though they are on different continents. Gino tries to play it off like maybe she&rsquo;s concerned about his safety, but this is clearly an insecurity issue &hellip; one that flares up in a big way when he speaks briefly with the young woman who hands him his food.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Red flag<br>This isn&rsquo;t the first or only red flag here, but Jasmine&rsquo;s distress about Gino speaking to the person who handed him his food is not a cute personality quirk, it&rsquo;s a toxic controlling behavior.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" data-id=\"358934\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real.png\" alt=\"Uncle Marco and his girlfriend Sandra visit\" class=\"wp-image-358934\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real.png 1920w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-480x270.png 480w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-720x405.png 720w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-320x180.png 320w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-735x413.png 735w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-335x188.png 335w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-347x195.png 347w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-520x293.png 520w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-640x360.png 640w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-960x540.png 960w, https:\/\/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com\/uploads\/2021\/12\/gino-palazzolos-uncle-marco-and-sandra-get-real-xenophobic-real-1080x608.png 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -

Usman wants kids<br>Kimberly cannot possibly conceive, but says that she might be okay with Usman marrying other women while married to her, so that he can have kids. Her friends strongly doubt that she will feel so cavalier about this if it actually happens.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Kimberly cannot handle the doubts<br>Even though she has done most of the talking, Kimberly breaks down into tears and walks off, upset that people who love her have concerns about her choices.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>They really are there for her<br>Also? We&rsquo;d love to see Alyssa and Vanessa on Pillow Talk. Vanessa&rsquo;s expressions and &ldquo;bigger hoop, bigger ho&rdquo; line really spoke to us.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Memphis and Hamza<br>Memphis is a 34-year-old single mom. Like Gino, she is from Michigan.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Okay!<br>Having witnessed Jesse Meester&rsquo;s butt pretty extensively on The Single Life, we&rsquo;re not sure how NSFW someone&rsquo;s outfit has to be before Discovery Plus starts censoring it, but Memphis was so hot as she modeled different looks that even the streaming app opted to blur out bits of her body.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Her friends are there to cheer her on<br>Kristie and Kesha were very well liked by viewers, to the point where some are already asking to see them on Pillow Talk.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Back at home<br>We see what looks like a very healthy relationship between Memphis and her 13-year-old daughter, Kennedi. Memphis has another child, a young son, whom she shares with her ex-husband. Memphis put herself through school, getting her Masters and entering the nursing field so that she can provide for her kids and herself.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Almost on a whim, she met Hamza on an international dating app<br>Hamza is the total package, to her, because he is hot and has nice lips and a good smile. Despite a significant language barrier, Memphis has fallen for him.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Some things don&rsquo;t require language<br>&ldquo;Sexy time&rdquo; is seemingly one of the only lines that they both understand.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Hamza&rsquo;s vocabulary is growing<br>It is fully possible to fall in love with someone when you don&rsquo;t speak the same language. But is it wise? That question has come up more than once on this show.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Memphis plans to marry Hamza<br>She assures Kristie and Kesha that she&rsquo;s not actually rushing into things as they fear, because her three-week trip won&rsquo;t start with a wedding. The pre-nup is for Week 1, the wedding is for week 2. Is that reassuring?<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>Memphis says that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;leap of faith&rdquo; that Hamza will be a good stepdad<br>That doesn&rsquo;t sound promising, and Memphis&rsquo; mother is similarly concerned. Now, Memphis&rsquo; mom had her own struggles when Memphis was a child, with a cocaine addiction that left Memphis and her family unable to keep a roof over their heads at times.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption>That makes it hard for Memphis to take her advice<br>Memphis knows that her mother is quick to dismiss Memphis&rsquo; childhood because it&rsquo;s a coping mechanism that she has developed, which makes sense. But one wishes that Memphis would realize that her rough time as a youth might be impacting her current decisions, and not in a good way.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/figure>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days is back with Season 5.
