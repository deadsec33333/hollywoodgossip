<p>We have tragic news to report from the world of fashion today:</p>



<p>Lucy Markovic &#8212; the model who first gained fame by placing second on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/12/jael-strauss-americas-next-top-model-alum-dead-at-34/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Australia&#8217;s Next Top Model</em> </a>&#8212; has passed away.</p>



<p>She was just 27 years old.</p>

<p>News of her passing comes to us courtesy of an unidentified family member, who announced Lucy&#8217;s death on her Instagram page:</p>



<p>&#8220;She was at peace. Me, her mother and my mother were present with her. We ask you please give us space in these hard times,&#8221; the statement read, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/04/11/lucy-markovic-dead-australia-next-top-model-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lucy-markovic-s-cause-of-death-revealed">Lucy Markovic&#8217;s cause of death revealed</h2>



<p>Markovic&#8217;s agency, Elite Model Management, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIRsInvveRP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=97a98708-7c55-4079-a2ad-27e313b9756a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a statement</a> in which they confirmed that she passed away as a result of brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM).</p>



<p>The condition is defined as &#8220;a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins in the brain.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-490008450-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lucy Markovic poses backstage ahead of the Australian Luxe show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Festival Sydney 2015 at Sydney Town Hall on September 25, 2015 in Sydney, Australia.

<p>&#8220;Lucy was a bright shining light, and had an incredible dry sense of humor. Her smile and laughter could light up a room, and draw you closer to her. She loved to dance, she really shined,&#8221; reads the statement from Elite Modeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Modeling was one of Lucy’s dreams, and we are deeply honored to have been part of that journey with her. She brought elegance, strength, and beauty to her work. But more than that, she brought herself—her warmth, her laughter, her light,&#8221; the statement continues.</p>



<p>&#8220;To her family and friends, please know that you are in our prayers and in our hearts. We mourn with you, and we celebrate the incredible person Lucy was. We will never forget her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy was still in her teens when she wowed <em>Australia&#8217;s Next Top Model</em> judges in 2015.</p>



<p>Though she did not claim the season&#8217;s top prize, she went on to a wildly successful modeling career, walking the runway for brands like Versace and Victoria Beckham.</p>



<p>According to TMZ, in a since-deleted social media post, Lucy revealed that she would be undergoing surgery after doctors found a malformation “the size of a golf ball” in her brain. She had also been experiencing seizures.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to Lucy&#8217;s loved ones during this enormously difficult time.</p>



<p>Though her life was tragically cut short, there&#8217;s some solace in knowing that she was able to live out her dreams.</p>

<p>If you were taken aback by that <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/the-white-lotus-season-3-where-to-next-and-who-might-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">White Lotus</a></em> scene involving Patrick Schwarzenegger and his onscreen brother, you weren&#8217;t alone.</p>



<p>Patrick opened up this week about his fiancee, Abby Champion&#8217;s, reaction to the display of brotherly love between Saxon and Lochlan Ratliff.</p>



<p>And as you can imagine, she was downright stunned by what she saw.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2202984329-1024x683.jpg" alt="Abby Champion and Patrick Schwarzenegger attend the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 02, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-racy-ratliffs-of-raleigh">The racy Ratliffs of Raleigh</h2>



<p>In case you missed it &#8212; or just blocked it out of your memory &#8212; Patrick wakes up to his brother, played by Sam Nivola, having sex with an older woman in the same bed.</p>



<p>(That&#8217;s a relative term, of course. Sam&#8217;s character is only 18.)</p>



<p>Sensing that his brother is feeling left out, Lochlan Ratliff reaches over and &#8230; gives him a hand.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s probably not what Abby had in mind when she learned that her fiance had starred in a sex scene.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell anybody,” Patrick recalled while appearing on Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s <em>Tonight Show</em> Thursday night (via <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/11/entertainment/patrick-schwarzenegger-shares-fiancees-reaction-to-white-lotus-incest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>).</p>



<p>“She was like, ‘You gotta tell me who dies.’ And I’m like, ‘I’m not telling you who dies! I signed my life away. Mike [White, the show’s creator] will fire me,&#8217;” he continued, referring to Abby.</p>



<p>“And she was like, ‘OK, fine. Just tell me, do you hook up with people?’ And I was like, ‘Baby, you know The White Lotus. I can’t tell you this information.’ She was like, ‘Just tell me, do you get with people?’ and I said, ‘Yes, I do.’ And she was like, ‘Who? Which girls do you get with?’ I was like, ‘I can’t tell you!&#8217;”</p>



<p>“She was like, ‘You got with your brother?!&#8217;” Abby exclaimed when the moment finally aired.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/arnold-patrick-schwarzenegger-the-white-lotus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick had multiple nude scenes</a> on the show, but not surprisingly, it seems that that was the one that most stood out to his fiancee.</p>



<p>For his part, Nivola says he was somewhat less secretive in the weeks leading up to the shocking scene.</p>



<p>“I told my parents, but I haven’t told my sister. She’s bad at keeping secrets,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/03/24/entertainment/white-lotus-star-sam-nivola-broke-nda-scared-of-hbo-suing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he previously admitted</a> to <em>Variety</em>.</p>



<p>“I’m not supposed to have told anyone, because I’m under a lot of NDAs. But I told my girlfriend [Iris Apatow] because she was there while we were shooting it. That’s about it. I’m really scared about getting sued by HBO.”</p>



<p>In the end, no one got sued, and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-who-lives-who-dies-what-becomes-of-the-wildly-effed-up-ratliff-clan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the entire Ratliff clan survived</a> their time in Thailand (though just barely).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;ll return for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-4-location-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The White Lotus</em> Season 4</a>, but you can be certain that we haven&#8217;t seen the last of Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola!</p>

<p>The movie <em>Marty Supreme</em> won&#8217;t hit theaters until December.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s already receiving very negative reviews from Ms. Kylie Jenner.</p>



<p>The film stars Timothee Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow, the latter of whom has spoken openly about the many graphic sex scenes involving the two leads.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kylie Jenner and actor TimothÃ©e Chalamet look on during the Men's Singles Final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Daniil Medvedev of Russia on Day Fourteen of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2023 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City." class="wp-image-523205" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1672742601-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kylie Jenner and actor TimothÃ©e Chalamet look on during the Men&#8217;s Singles Final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Daniil Medvedev of Russia on Day Fourteen of the 2023 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 10, 2023 in the Flushing neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gwyneth-says-she-and-timothee-do-a-lot-of-banging-in-upcoming-ping-pong-film">Gwyneth says she and Timothee do a lot of banging in upcoming ping pong film</h2>



<p>The film, directed by Josh Safdie, features Timothee as a professional ping pong player who carries on an affair with Gwyneth</p>



<p>“I mean, we have a lot of sex in this movie. There’s a lot—a lot,&#8221; Paltrow explained to <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/gwyneth-paltrow-2025-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a></em>.</p>



<p>“There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator, which I did not know existed,” she added, noting that when the film&#8217;s intimacy coordinator asked her if she’d be comfortable with a particular move “I was like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on.’ ”</p>



<p>Gwyneth might have laughed the situation off, but it seems that Kylie failed to see the humor.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;re probably aware, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kylie-jenner-timothee-chalamet-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timothee are in a very serious relationship</a>, and it seems that she&#8217;s not keen on the idea of watching him pretend to bang someone else.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-kylie-angry-about-the-reports-of-timmy-s-sex-scenes">Is Kylie angry about the reports of Timmy&#8217;s sex scenes?</h2>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/timothee-chalamet-sex-scenes-ban-jealous-kylie-jenner-gwyneth-paltrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>, Kylie is furious over the film&#8217;s sultry content, and she&#8217;s instructed Timothee not to film any more sex scenes.</p>



<p>“Timothee has no problem being intimate in movies, but Kylie doesn&#8217;t like it. She doesn&#8217;t appreciate all the details and doesn&#8217;t want him to film any more sex scenes moving forward,&#8221; a source tells the outlet.</p>



<p>And apparently, this is no small matter. In fact, the insider claims that it&#8217;s resulted in the worst rough patch of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/is-kylie-jenner-pregnant-timothee-chalamet-would-be-the-likely-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie and Timothee&#8217;s relationship</a>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1024x683.jpg" alt="Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner attend a match during the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on March 09, 2025 in Indian Wells, California." class="wp-image-523206" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2204249873-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner attend a match during the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on March 09, 2025 in Indian Wells, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;It has been the main source of tension between them lately, and it’s something that has been deeply bothering them,” said the insider.</p>



<p>The source added that Chalamet&#8217;s inner circle is concerned about the ways in which Kylie&#8217;s puritanical rule might limit his career prospects.</p>



<p>&#8220;He wants to explore everything as an actor and artist. It&#8217;s the biggest moment of tension between them since they started dating,&#8221; the insider added.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that Timmy&#8217;s loved ones have expressed misgivings about the relationship.</p>



<p>One insider recently described Kylie and Timothee as &#8220;two complete opposites.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;Many of us don&#8217;t understand how they connect and click.&#8221;</p>



<p>But hey &#8212; as long as Kylie and Timothee understand the attraction, that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>



<p>We just hope she&#8217;ll open up to the idea that pretending to fall for other people is part of Timmy&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>And the country crooner revealed this week that he&#8217;s reached a major milestone.</p>



<p>In a new interview with ESPN&#8217;s Pat McAfee, Mr. Roll revealed that he&#8217;s dropped a full 200 pounds!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jelly-roll-shares-astonishing-weight-loss-update">Jelly Roll shares astonishing weight loss update</h2>



<p>“I started at 540 pounds, and I was 357 pounds this morning,” the singer told McAfee during the Big Night AHT live show on Wednesday April 9 (per <em><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/jelly-roll-reveals-plans-after-losing-200-lbs-next-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>). </p>



<p>Jelly Roll added that he&#8217;s far from finished &#8212; and he has big plans for his future.</p>



<p>“I’m gonna lose another 100 pounds and go skydiving with my wife in Sweden,&#8221; he told McAfee.</p>



<p>Obviously, that sort of weight loss deserves praise no matter the methods one uses. But Jelly Roll&#8217;s weight loss is made all the more impressive by the fact that he started making progress long before the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/lizzo-weight-loss-ozempic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">age of Ozempic</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jelly-roll-s-impressive-progress">Jelly Roll&#8217;s impressive progress</h2>



<p>Jelly Roll has been sharing updates with fans for nearly two years now. And each is more impressive than the last.</p>



<p>“I’m probably down 70-something pounds. I’ve been really kicking [butt], man,”<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/jelly-roll-celebrates-70-pound-weight-loss-i-feel-really-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> he told</a> <em>People</em> magazine in April 2024.</p>



<p>And while some newly trimmed-down celebs might prefer to keep their secrets to themselves, Jelly has been happy to fill fans in on his weight loss strategy.</p>



<p> “I’m doing two to three miles a day, four to six days a week. I’m doing 20 to 30 minutes in the sauna, six minutes in a cold plunge every day,&#8221; he told <em>People</em>.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-1024x683.jpg" alt='Jelly Roll attends the "Jelly Roll: Save Me" Documentary World Premiere at the Ryman Auditorium on May 30, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee.' class="wp-image-523184" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1494691353-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jelly Roll attends the &#8220;Jelly Roll: Save Me&#8221; Documentary World Premiere at the Ryman Auditorium on May 30, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The 40-year-old explained that he was feeling “really good” at the time &#8212; but that he had no intention of stopping there.</p>



<p>“If I feel this good down this weight, man, I can only imagine what I’m going to feel like by the time I go on tour,” he explained.</p>



<p>Clearly, Jelly has no intention of resting on his laurels and priding himself on how far he&#8217;s come.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t walk a mile when I started trying to do this back in January,” he told <em>Entertainment Tonight </em>in May 2024. “So the fact that we got 3-point-whatever it was, got it down, I felt really, really good about it.”</p>



<p>We have no doubt that Jelly Roll will be skydiving in Sweden in no time!</p>

<p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-says-he-never-wanted-kids-with-kim-kardashian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West&#8217;s disgusting social media rants</a> have shocked fans and horrified the rapper&#8217;s few remaining friends.</p>



<p>In tirades posted to X (formerly Twitter), West has declared himself a Nazi and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/kanye-west-accuses-kim-kardashian-of-sex-trafficking-while-hanging-with-alleged-rapist-andrew-tate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, of being a sex trafficker</a>.</p>



<p>There was a time when it was hard to imagine how Kanye could possibly sink any lower.</p>



<p>But he may have done just that with his latest tantrum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-makes-crude-comments-about-threesome-between-taylor-swift-justin-bieber-harry-styles">Kanye makes crude comments about threesome between Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Harry Styles</h2>



<p>In a rant that began late Wednesday night and continued into Thursday afternoon, Kanye made crass remarks about a number of celebrities, chief among them, Taylor Swift.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll show you an example of racism. Justin Bieber and Harry Styles f&#8211;ked Taylor Swift from both sides and didn’t call me,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/kanyewest/status/1910211139285455084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he tweeted</a> at one point, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;ON EVEYTHIIING THIS TWEET IS ONE THOUSAND PERCENT TRUE.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1024x683.jpg" alt='Taylor Swift performs on stage during the "Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour" at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024 in London, England.' class="wp-image-523170" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166913977-5-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Swift performs on stage during the &#8220;Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour&#8221; at Wembley Stadium on August 15, 2024 in London, England.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Kate Green/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kanye went on to fantasize about shocking Taylor by revealing such information.</p>



<p>&#8220;I KNOW TAYLOR LIKE HOW THE F&#8211;K HE KNOW THAT,&#8221; he wrote, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;IM MAD I HAVENT F&#8211;KED TAYLOR SWIFT … YET.&#8221;</p>



<p>The remarks are particularly horrifying when taken as the latest evidence of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/travis-kelces-dad-slams-kanye-west-over-taylor-swift-based-song-lyrics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye&#8217;s years-long obsession with Taylor</a>, which was first displayed when he infamously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>

<p>Obviously, the whole situation is disgusting, but Kanye being Kanye, he was just getting warmed up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanye-makes-nauseating-comments-about-kim">Kanye makes nauseating comments about Kim </h2>



<p>From there, Kanye moved on to one of his favorite topics &#8212; the Kim Kardashian sex tape. Sure, the footage came out back in 2007, and Kim is the mother of Kanye&#8217;s four kids, but that won&#8217;t stop him from being gross about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Told Ray J we need to hit Kim from both sides for that Superstar part two,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/nojumper/status/1910354728489197590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Kanye also admitted to sexually assaulting unsuspecting women while greeting them.</p>



<p>&#8220;I used to do this hug where I press my c-ck against the girls leg and place my hands right where my pinky can touch the top of their a-s like right under the small of their back,&#8221; he wrote.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="681" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-681x1024.jpg" alt="Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival - Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City." class="wp-image-523166" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-639x960.jpg 639w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-719x1080.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-799x1200.jpg 799w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1186140732-1-scaled.jpg 1704w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kanye West attends the Fast Company Innovation Festival &#8211; Day 3 Arrivals on November 07, 2019 in New York City.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images for Fast Company)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As he often does these days, West also praised Hitler repeatedly throughout his tirade. At one point, he tweeted a photo of the infamous dictator along with a goat emoji.</p>



<p>This prompted Kanye&#8217;s long-suffering wife Bianca Censori to speak out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me be clear, Hitler was a genocidal murderer who should never be celebrated. Praising him is a direct insult to the millions who suffered especially the Jewish people,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/Bianca_censor/status/1910319029824483500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she wrote</a>, adding:</p>



<p>&#8220;@kanyewest antisemitic rhetoric is not only disturbing, it stands against everything I believe in. As long as he keeps repeating this dangerous narrative, I’ll keep speaking out—I want no part in it, &amp; never will.&#8221;</p>



<p>There have been reports that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/bianca-censori-stays-with-kanye-west-out-of-fear-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca has separated from Kanye</a> and initiated divorce proceedings, but those remain unconfirmed.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it seems she&#8217;s finally grown tired of his crap.</p>

<p>Back in December, former <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> star <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence-get-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Kennedy was arrested on domestic violence charges</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, his then-girlfriend, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/ally-lewber-opens-up-about-explosive-final-fight-with-james-kennedy-reveals-he-had-been-drinking-behind-my-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ally Lewber, ended their relationship</a>.</p>



<p>Ally says she was not physically injured during the incident that led to James&#8217; arrest.</p>



<p>However, she says that despite previous claims that he&#8217;d quit drinking, he became drunk and belligerent. And according to a police report, she told officers that her “boyfriend lifted her up and threw her to the ground.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, Ally made the right call in kicking James to the curb.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ally-says-lisa-vanderpump-tried-to-convince-her-to-forgive-james">Ally says Lisa Vanderpump tried to convince her to forgive James</h2>



<p>But despite the fact that the relationship obviously needed to end, Ally says that after she moved out on James, she received a call from Lisa Vanderpump, who urged her to take him back.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was basically like, ‘Ally, like, he needs you … you’re really good together,’” Ally told Nick Viall on his &#8220;Viall Files&#8221; podcast this week (via <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/04/09/ally-lewber-claims-lisa-vanderpump-tried-to-convince-her-to-forgive-james-kennedy-following-the-vanderpump-rules-stars-domestic-violence-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup</a>).</p>



<p>She added that Lisa “was trying to convince [her] to stay with [James]” and gaslit her by pointing out that both parties were drinking on the night of Kennedy&#8217;s arrest (Ally, unlike James, has no history of violence and is not an alcoholic).</p>

<p>Lisa even went so far as to try to convince Ally to accompany James on a slate of DJ-ing gigs he&#8217;d scheduled before his arrest.</p>



<p>“I’m like, first of all, what shows? He’s canceled right now,” Ally said (the gigs were, indeed, canceled). “And also, no. I just moved into an apartment … we’re not together.”</p>



<p>Ally says she believes that Lisa feels protective of James despite his many years of problematic behavior, But she also believes that as a producer on the show that made him famous Lisa was also “trying to, quite literally, produce” drama.</p>



<p>“She’s very protective over James,” Ally said. “I get it, because I was, too, for a long time,”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lisa-vanderpump-s-long-history-of-being-wrong">Lisa Vanderpump&#8217;s long history of being wrong</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/jax-taylor-slams-lisa-vanderpump-for-defending-james-kennedys-alleged-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa has been defending James&#8217; abusive behavior</a> for years, and she&#8217;s been called out by everyone from Jax Taylor to Nick Viall.</p>



<p>In a bizarre interview with <em><a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2025/02/07/kristen-doute-slams-lisa-vanderpump-for-enabling-james-kennedys-abusive-behavior-absolutely-disgustingly-diabolical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a></em>, Lisa insisted that James “didn’t hurt [Ally] categorically,” and insisted that Ally “regrets what happened with how this blew up.”</p>



<p>Lisa also blamed Ally for the conflict, explaining that she and James were “both being ridiculous and arguing” and  insisting that she had him arrested to “teach him a lesson.”</p>



<p>James previous exes, Kristen Doute and Raquel Leviss, have both accused him of abusive behavior. Ally says that James convinced her during their relationship that his exes were lying &#8212; but she now sees the light.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s so hard, because James has been in my ear– not now, but for our relationship, obviously– and I’ve heard a lot from the rest of the cast,” she said. “Mutually, that was just a very toxic relationship on both parties, so I don’t really want to say anything, but I will say that– and I have to say this, but also, it’s true– I will always believe women.”</p>

<p>We have a bizarre story out of Los Angeles, where the wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner was reportedly shot by police on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The trouble began when California Highway Patrol and LAPD officers responded to calls of a hit-and-run accident in the LA neighborhood of Eagle Rock.</p>



<p>Three suspects reportedly fled on foot, leading police to chase after them.</p>



<p>The chase led them into the Shriners&#8217; backyard, allegedly prompting Jillian to step outside with a 9mm handgun.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jillian-shriner-s-encounter-with-police-nearly-turns-deadly">Jillian Shriner&#8217;s encounter with police nearly turns deadly</h2>



<p>Law enforcement sources say Jillian was ordered to drop the weapon &#8220;numerous times.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;However, she refused,&#8221; <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/weezer-bassist-scott-shriners-wife-shot-police-booked-attempted-murder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says a rep for the LAPD</a>.</p>



<p>Officers fired, and Jillian reportedly retreated back inside her home. She later emerged in order to be treated for her injuries.</p>



<p>While in the hospital, she was booked on attempted murder charges. Jillian&#8217;s bail was set at $1 million.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear if she&#8217;s still in custody. Both she and Scott have thus far declined to comment publicly on the matter.</p>



<p>Little is known about Jillian other than the fact that she and Shriner are parents to two children, and she&#8217;s an author who is credited with two books &#8212; <em>Some Girls: My Life in a Harem</em> and <em>Behold the Monster: Confronting America&#8217;s Most Prolific Serial Killer.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this year, she revealed that she had undergone successful treatment for cancer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have a little bit of the C word y’all. I know a lot of us do,&#8221; Jillian wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’m here to thank the incredible oncology team here, who pulled me through a complicated operation without a hitch,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am always so grateful for every second of the compassionate, and excellent medical care I receive in my life. Thank you to all the remarkable health care workers, who take our lives in your hands. And let’s all breathe,&#8221; she captioned her post.&#8221;</p>



<p>As for what&#8217;s next for Jillian, that&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess. She&#8217;ll likely argue that she was spooked by the commotion in her backyard, but if she really pointed a gun at police, that explanation probably won&#8217;t be enough to save her from legal consequences.</p>



<p>A plea deal might enable her to avoid jail time, but she likely has several months of legal wrangling ahead of her.</p>



<p>The most important thing now is that her injuries appear to be minor. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>For several weeks now, we&#8217;ve been reporting on the persistent rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/barack-obama-divorce-chatter-hits-fever-pitch-source-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barack and Michelle are headed for divorce</a>.</p>



<p>While neither party commented on the situation directly, there seemed to be numerous signs that something had changed within the Obamas&#8217; marriage.</p>



<p>For starters, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/barack-obama-attends-la-clippers-game-without-michelle-amid-rampant-divorce-speculation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barack made numerous solo public appearances</a> at a time when he must have already caught wind of the rumors.</p>



<p>Observers figured that he must have known how the public would react, and the move might therefore be his subtle way of confirming that he and Michelle were headed for Splitsville.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Former US First Lady Michelle Obama introduces Former US President Barack Obama on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024.

<p>But during a recent appearance on Sophia Bush&#8217;s podcast, Michelle quashed the divorce rumors.</p>



<p>She pointed out, quite reasonably, that she and Barack are both very busy people, and it makes perfect sense that they would attend events separately from time to time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-michelle-embraces-the-power-of-no">Michelle embraces the power of &#8216;no&#8217;</h2>



<p>Speaking with Bush, Michelle revealed that in recent years, she&#8217;s been forced to turn down more invitations. And apparently, she&#8217;s found the experience empowering.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2167672114-682x1024.jpg" alt="Former U.S. President Barack Obama greets former first lady Michelle Obama as he arrives to speak on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.

<p>“The interesting thing is that when I say ‘no,’ for the most part, people are like, ‘I get it,’ and I’m OK,” Michelle explained, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/09/celebrity-news/michelle-obama-addresses-barack-divorce-rumors-after-stepping-away-from-the-limelight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.</p>



<p>“And that’s the thing that we as women struggle with — disappointing people,” she continued. </p>



<p>“So much so that people, they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”</p>



<p>From there, Michelle laughed off the idea that her marriage was coming to an end, dismissing the rumors as the result of small minds and their inability to cope with the fact that she&#8217;s “a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1024x683.jpg" alt="Former US President Barack Obama arrives onstage after his wife and former First Lady Michelle Obama introduced him on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024." class="wp-image-523113" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935704-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former US President Barack Obama arrives onstage after his wife and former First Lady Michelle Obama introduced him on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“But that’s what society does to us,” she said. </p>



<p>“We actually finally start going, ‘What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?’ And if it doesn’t fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible.”</p>



<p>Yes, it seems that Michelle merely began pursuing her own interests &#8212; she launched a new podcast with her brother last month &#8212; and because of that, the whole world assumed she was getting divorced.</p>



<p>Her comments probably won&#8217;t put the rumors to bed completely.</p>



<p>But for now, we feel perfectly comfortable declaring that there&#8217;s no reason to believe these two are calling it quirs.</p>

<p>If you watched the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-who-lives-who-dies-what-becomes-of-the-wildly-effed-up-ratliff-clan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 finale of <em>The White Lotus</em></a>, then you know that things came to a head in a big way Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood&#8217;s characters.</p>



<p>If you <em>haven&#8217;t</em> caught the episode yet, 1. <em>What have you been doing with yourself?</em> and 2. Be warned &#8212; spoilers lie ahead!</p>



<p>Every season of <em>Lotus</em> ends with the death of a major character, and Season 3 offered a double-whammy as Goggins&#8217; Rick and Wood&#8217;s Chelsea were both gunned down in heartbreaking fashion.</p>



<p>(Scott Glenn, as Rick&#8217;s shady dad, also bit the dust, but he could hardly be described as a &#8220;major&#8221; character.)</p>

<p>Anyway, between his work as Rick and his role as Uncle Baby Billy on <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, Goggins is finally getting his due as TV&#8217;s top character actor.</p>



<p>But Goggins&#8217; big moment has been somewhat overshadowed by a bit of salacious gossip that&#8217;s gained a surprising amount of traction on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-goggins-and-wood-leave-thailand-on-bad-terms">Did Goggins and Wood leave Thailand on bad terms?</h2>



<p>After the episode aired, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIIPIg5OxGl/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goggins paid loving tribute to Wood</a> with a moving Instagram post about how much their collaboration meant to him.</p>

<p>But as <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/04/09/celebrity-news/white-lotus-co-stars-walton-goggins-and-aimee-lou-wood-spark-feud-rumors-after-finale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> points out, eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that the costars are no longer following one another on Instagram.</p>



<p>In fact, it looks as though Goggins may have blocked Wood, as her earlier comments on his posts have all disappeared.</p>



<p>The actors have made mostly positive comments about each other in the press.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aimee-s-cryptic-comments-about-walton">Aimee&#8217;s cryptic comments about Walton</h2>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1024x683.jpg" alt="Walton Goggins stars as Rick on 'The White Lotus.'" class="wp-image-523098" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/walton-goggins_0.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Walton Goggins stars as Rick on &#8216;The White Lotus.&#8217;<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Max)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But in a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-chelsea-death-aimee-lou-wood-interview-1236183887/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>, Wood noted that Goggins skipped the finale viewing party, and the situation led her to compare the star to his toxic character.</p>



<p>“I was sad that Walton wasn’t there because it was something that we did together but also it’s so f–king Rick and Chelsea,” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-chelsea-death-aimee-lou-wood-interview-1236183887/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she told the outlet</a>.</p>



<p>“Like, of course Walton had to watch it alone and of course I had to watch it in the group because there is so much Aimee in Chelsea and so much Walton in Rick.”</p>



<p>Those comments come on the heels of remarks made by Jason Isaacs &#8212; who played embattled patriarch Timothy Ratliff &#8212; who revealed that there was quite a bit of tension on set.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was like a cross between summer camp and Lord of the Flies but in a gilded cage,&#8221; he told <em><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jason-isaacs-white-lotus-tim-ratliff-breakdown-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a></em>. &#8220;It wasn’t a holiday. Some people got very close, there were friendships that were made and friendships that were lost.&#8221;</p>



<p>Was he referring to bad blood between Goggins and Wood? </p>



<p>Or is there truth to the rumors that Isaacs didn&#8217;t get along with his onscreen wife, Parker Posey?</p>



<p>We may never know for sure. But it sounds like enough tension off-camera to fuel <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-4-location-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an entire season of <em>The White Lotus</em></a>!</p>

<p>Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/christina-applegate-gets-candid-about-ms-says-she-wears-a-diaper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Applegate&#8217;s life changed forever </a>when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</p>



<p>The beloved actress has been extremely candid in her discussions of her condition, and many chronic illness patients have drawn inspiration from her example.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/christina-applegate-ms-health-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina still attends events like the Emmys</a>, and she remains as active as her condition allows.</p>



<p>But sadly, she now says that her illness has advanced to the point where she&#8217;s not able to do quite as much as she used to.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christina-appleagate-opens-up-about-the-state-of-her-health">Christina Appleagate opens up about the state of her health</h2>



<p>Appearing on Hoda Kotb&#8217;s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/christina-applegate-and-jamie-lynn-sigler-on-the/id1585499926?i=1000702839344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Making Space&#8221; podcast</a> this week, Applegate gave a heartbreaking update on her battle with MS.</p>



<p>“I am defined by it right now,” Christina told Hoda during a discussion about her illness, adding:</p>



<p>“I have days where I can’t even walk to the bathroom, so I am defined by it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Christina explained that even after four years of fighting this illness, there are days when it just doesn&#8217;t seem real to her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-christina-says-her-condition-is-getting-worse">Christina says her condition is &#8216;getting worse&#8217;</h2>



<p>“I’m angry at it still, and there’s a lot of us out there who are newly diagnosed that are not quite ready to accept this reality,” she told Hoda. </p>



<p>“I keep thinking that I’m just going to wake up from this nightmare, and it’s just going to be over,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>“I want to do these things and I can’t, and it feels like I’m getting worse. And that’s disheartening. But then there’s like this voice inside of me that is like, ‘You’ve got to believe in a miracle. You’ve got to believe in another side of this.’”</p>



<p>Christina also hosts a podcast with former <em>Sopranos</em> star Jamie Lynn Sigler who has been battling MS for 23 years.</p>

<p>During a recent conversation, Jamie Lynn made similar remarks about her long battle with this terrible illness.</p>



<p>“Of course, I would love to not struggle in my body,” she said. </p>



<p>“I would love to not have a disability. I would love to be able to participate in my life the way I would choose to, but the way that I look at the world, and the way that I feel about people, I don’t know if it would be the same without this.”</p>



<p>Sigler has been battling MS since she was 20, and her public remarks offer the perspective of someone who can scarcely recall a time when the disease was not a part of their world.</p>



<p>Applegate, of course, is much newer to the experience, and it seems that her feelings are much more raw as a result.</p>



<p>But she&#8217;s already helped countless listeners with her wise but sardonic commentary on the challenges of chronic illness &#8212; and we&#8217;re sure she&#8217;ll continue to do so for many years to come.</p>
