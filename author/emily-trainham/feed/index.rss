<p>Sometimes it feels good to be right about something you&#8217;ve been speculating for a while.</p>



<p>Other times &#8230; not so much.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>And unfortunately this time, it&#8217;s actually pretty darn painful.</p>



<p>For years now, Sister Wives fans have thought that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/robyn-brown-for-the-last-time-i-am-not-kodys-favorite-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody Brown clearly favored his fourth wife, Robyn</a>.</p>



<p>Things <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/meri-brown-its-been-10-years-im-dying-to-sleep-with-kody-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been rocky between Kody and Meri</a> for years now, and his relationship with Janelle has always seemed like more of a platonic one, which is something he noted recently on the show.</p>



<p>And, well, we all know <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/christine-brown-reveals-the-worst-thing-kody-ever-said-to-her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how bad his marriage to Christine was</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s just been recently that anyone on the show has started to talk about what we&#8217;ve all been saying for years &#8212; Christine and Janelle have plainly said that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/christine-brown-kody-loves-robyn-and-hates-our-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they feel Robyn is the favorite wife</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kody maintains that he<em> would</em> like the other wives more <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-brown-demands-loyalty-from-janelle-tells-her-be-more-like-robyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if they were more like Robyn</a>, so the problems are their fault, not his.</p>



<p>Right now, we know that Christine has fully divorced him and moved off to Utah, and that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/janelle-brown-confirms-yes-kody-and-i-are-separated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he and Janelle have been separated</a> for months.</p>



<p>We saw in sneak peeks for the tell-all that Kody doesn&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s married to Meri anymore, and she acknowledged that &#8212; we&#8217;re not sure <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/meri-brown-and-kody-brown-yup-this-marriage-is-over-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where exactly that leaves them though</a>, as she also said she still wanted to make things work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>So for all intents and purposes, Kody is in a monogamous marriage with Robyn right now.</p>



<p>And Gwendlyn Brown, Christine&#8217;s daughter and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/gwendlyn-brown-thanks-for-getting-divorced-mom-and-dad-now-im-famous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most outspoken cast members</a>, addressed how that&#8217;s affected the rest of the family in a Q&amp;A on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/gwendlynbrown/posts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her Patreon page</a>.</p>



<p>One of her patrons asked her if &#8220;anyone besides your mom ever confronted Robyn and Kody about their behavior? Specifically, Kody favoring Robyn and her kids?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her answer was pretty heartbreaking.</p>

<p>“We do avoid the topic a lot,&#8221; Gwen admitted, &#8220;but sometimes one of us will break down and ask him why he chose her over us. We’re not very confrontational here unfortunately.”</p>



<p>When asked how Kody responded to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/gabriel-brown-i-havent-talked-to-my-dad-since-he-forgot-my-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his own children breaking down</a> in front of him for feeling unwanted and unloved by him, her response was unsurprising:</p>



<p>“Usually denial.”</p>



<p>Someone asked if he had ever shown any remorse for <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-brown-actually-breaks-down-laments-sad-direction-of-polygamous-family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing all of these issues in the family</a>, and if anyone had ever confronted him directly about his preference for Robyn and her children over everyone else.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>“Most of the kids have yes!&#8221; she said. &#8220;One time he responded to one of them like ‘I prefer people who prefer me,’ so no remorse lol.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, one person asked Gwen if Kody had just been faking being a good father earlier in the show, or if he really was a dedicated father and something changed.</p>



<p>“I don’t really know but i think he just started to realize he prefers his life with Robyn and their kids,&#8221; she replied.</p>



<p>How sad, right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We hope that one day Kody is able to open his eyes enough to see the damage he&#8217;s caused to his own children.</p>



<p>But honestly, he doesn&#8217;t seem to have the emotional capacity for that kind of introspection.</p>



<p>We hope that his first three wives are happy, and that all of their children are thriving.</p>



<p>What a mess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t really take an astute observer to realize that Janelle Brown hasn&#8217;t been happy in her marriage for a while now.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve kept an eye and/or an ear on Sister Wives for the past couple of seasons, you&#8217;d know that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-and-janelle-brown-both-know-their-marriage-is-doomed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she&#8217;s pretty fed up with Kody</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Which is totally fair &#8212; thousands of viewers feel the same way, and we don&#8217;t even have to interact with him.</p>



<p>Last season, we saw the two of them arguing back and forth over her decision to let her adult sons live with her while they set themselves up for success in life, which is something totally normal and not even a little strange.</p>



<p>During one of those arguments, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/janelle-brown-tells-husband-kody-to-f-k-off-in-stunning-new-sist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle even told Kody to &#8220;f-ck off,&#8221;</a> which was definitely surprising.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s kept up that attitude this season, too &#8212; she&#8217;s even amped it up a few notches.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen her be a best friend to Christine as she navigated <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/christine-brown-i-left-kody-because-hes-an-awful-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her divorce from Kody</a>, something which Kody said felt like a betrayal.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen her actually tell Kody that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/janelle-brown-finally-admits-yes-im-questioning-my-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she was questioning their relationship</a> and whether or not it was working anymore.</p>



<p>In a confessional, she said “I never thought I’d be in a place where I would be questioning my relationship, but the last few years, I’ve began to wonder if we’re compatible anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the newest episode, we see <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-brown-i-blame-janelle-for-our-kids-hating-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody berate her for not respecting him</a> and his wishes on how the family should have reacted in the early days of the pandemic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Later, she told the camera, and this is super interesting, that &#8220;I don’t need to be <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/janelle-brown-i-wont-let-kody-beat-me-into-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beaten into submission</a>, made to kowtow. I’m just not. I just don’t need this.&#8221;</p>



<p>“In the last 18 months, I’ve realized that I’m pretty good. I’m independent, and I’m not going to stand here and be yelled at. I just don’t need it. I don’t deserve it and I don’t need it.”</p>



<p>Rumors have been running rampant for months that she&#8217;s left him.</p>



<p>Just a couple of days ago, an anonymous source told In Touch “Janelle is a strong independent woman and realized <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/janelle-brown-dumps-kody-its-finally-over-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she can do it on her own</a>,&#8221; and that she &#8220;outgrew&#8221; Kody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>And of course we can&#8217;t forget that memorable moment where Gwen, Christine&#8217;s daughter, stated on social media that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/janelle-brown-has-left-kody-reliable-sister-wives-insider-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody was only with Meri and Robyn</a> these days.</p>



<p>At this point, it feels like we&#8217;re really just waiting on an official statement, either on the show or on social media.</p>



<p>But it turns out that Janelle has made a little statement over on Instagram &#8230; and it&#8217;s pretty darn interesting.</p>



<p>In the past, Janelle&#8217;s Instagram bio mentioned being a wife and a mother, so pretty standard stuff, right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Earlier this year, she changed it to read “I’m just over here living my best life. I ❤️ shoes but can’t figure out how to wear them fashionably (Ask my kids).&#8221;</p>



<p>Fans noticed it, and of course it was interesting &#8212; at that point, the rumors had definitely already started, and this would have been shortly after the footage we&#8217;re seeing now was filmed.</p>



<p>But fans also noticed that recently, she changed her bio up again, this time to read &#8220;Just me&#8221; along with a big smiley face.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s pretty telling, huh?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Some Sister Wives sleuths have pointed out that just before <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/christine-brown-its-official-im-no-longer-a-sister-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine announced her split from Kody</a>, she made a similar change to her Instagram bio.</p>



<p>Others think that she&#8217;s referring to the fact that her youngest child, Savannah, just turned 18, so perhaps she&#8217;s moved out and she&#8217;s just telling us that she&#8217;s living completely by herself now.</p>



<p>Another popular theory is that this change is sort of a combination of these two things, that maybe she has left him, but wanted to wait until all her children were grown before making it official.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Either way, Janelle has to be aware of the rumors and of how bad her relationship with Kody looks on the show, so changing her bio like this seems pretty pointed.</p>



<p>Could this finally be the end for Kody and his second wife?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been watching the current season of Sister Wives, then you know that Kody has been kind of a jackass.</p>



<p>Like more than normal, even.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The issue, of course, is that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/christine-brown-i-left-kody-because-hes-an-awful-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine made the decision to leave him</a>, and that left him feeling sad, but he&#8217;s too narcissistic to be able to process that, so he acts out instead.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been pretty tough to watch him flounder, completely unable to work through his feelings and just <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-im-a-huge-mess-okay-christine-left-me-heartbroken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall back on being awful</a> instead.</p>



<p>In a memorable scene from earlier this season, Kody demanded that his remaining wives &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/sister-wives-recap-the-bombshell-gets-dropped-how-do-the-women-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conform to patriarchy</a>,&#8221; and he said that he feared his decision to let the wives be independent destroyed their family.</p>



<p>What a gem, right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Kody could never be accused of being a feminist, but this is a lot, even for him.</p>



<p>And according to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TLC/videos/678676403925671/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sneak peek</a> from this week&#8217;s episode of Sister Wives, Robyn thinks Kody&#8217;s opinion of women in general are, well, not great.</p>



<p>The clip begins with Robyn, Kody, Janelle, and Meri having what appears to be a very serious conversation about the state of their relationships now that Christine is gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to be a plural wife when your husband has a wife leaving him,&#8221; Robyn says, barely able to get the words out through her tears.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;And most men in monogamy,&#8221; she continues, &#8220;they just go do stupid stuff, they date whoever and they&#8217;re angry and they&#8217;re pissed and women suck.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dealing with that while he&#8217;s married.&#8221;</p>



<p>Robyn says that she&#8217;s told Kody that she feels like &#8220;he&#8217;s lining up all women, and you&#8217;re there, and you&#8217;re there,&#8221; she tells Janelle and Meri.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shooting us all down because Christine is a woman and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-brown-actually-breaks-down-laments-sad-direction-of-polygamous-family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he&#8217;s angry and he&#8217;s hurt</a>.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Yikes, right?</p>



<p>You&#8217;d hope that in a situation like this the husband would be able to deal with his feelings about one wife without it affecting his opinion on literally all women, but this is Kody we&#8217;re talking about.</p>



<p>So that might be too much to hope for.</p>



<p>In a confessional, Kody says that &#8220;I think women bear a very different burden in plural marriage than men do, and I&#8217;ve seen men leave plural marriage feeling like, you know, five or six wives, never feeling like they&#8217;d been loved.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Aww, poor Kody, huh?</p>



<p>&#8220;Plural marriage isn&#8217;t all beer and skittles,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;It&#8217;s not for a man.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thankfully he acknowledges that women and men in plural marriage do both have their own kinds of struggles, and he even says that he doesn&#8217;t want to &#8220;mansplain&#8221; the matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just obvious that it&#8217;s difficult,&#8221; he says. &#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re going to share your husband, why would you do that?'&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Back in the big conversation with everyone, Robyn tells the group that she just wants to get everything figured out in their relationships.</p>



<p>At that moment, Janelle, who has clearly <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/janelle-brown-i-wont-let-kody-beat-me-into-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been over Kody&#8217;s nonsense</a> for some time, gets up to leave, saying that she has to go pick up her daughter.</p>



<p>It seems like they&#8217;d been planning on showing each other some plans for the homes they eventually want to build on Coyote Pass, so the conversation switches to that so Janelle can show hers before she leaves.</p>



<p>In his confessional, Kody has a rare moment of clarity in which he realizes that &#8220;We&#8217;re going down a road where we really were on the verge of a critical conversation.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;And now we&#8217;re looking at plans and getting all happy and everything like that. I think it was a mistake, I think we should have finished the crucial conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just going to ignore it,&#8221; he admits. &#8220;That&#8217;s just what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s so wild to watch clips like this because it&#8217;s so astoundingly clear to viewers that the family is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-brown-i-blame-janelle-for-our-kids-hating-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right on the verge of imploding</a>.</p>



<p>Like, things are not going well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>After watching this, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/janelle-brown-dumps-kody-its-finally-over-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rumors that Janelle has left</a> are even more believable, as if that was even possible, and Christine choice to get out of there seems even smarter.</p>



<p>If Kody is treating his wives badly just because they&#8217;re women and a woman hurt him, and if he&#8217;s indirectly complaining about feeling unloved even though he has multiple wives &#8230;</p>



<p>What are they all even doing? Why live like that?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Can this situation get even more uncomfortable to watch? Will Kody somehow manage to become <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/12/kody-brown-makes-it-clear-i-dont-want-a-relationship-with-meri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more unlikable than he already is</a>?</p>



<p>Guess we&#8217;ll have to tune in to find out!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 4</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>The financial situation of the Brown family is something of a mystery.</p>



<p>And that makes sense, considering it&#8217;s a family consisting of one man with multiple wives and no traditional source of income.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we do know: the family has a joint account where they all put money to pay for group purchases and for emergencies.</p>



<p>Each person has their own personal bank account, too.</p>



<p>Most of the wives make a considerable amount of money selling things to their fans through businesses that are <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/meri-brown-claps-back-i-do-not-work-for-a-pyramid-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absolutely 100% not a pyramid scheme</a>, thank you very much.</p>



<p>Meri is wildly successful at her LuLaRoe hustle, as is Christine, and<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/05/janelle-and-christine-brown-continue-to-hang-out-promote-shady-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Christine and Janelle also sell diet products</a> together.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Meri also owns <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/kody-brown-pushes-meri-to-move-out-go-live-in-your-bed-and-breakfast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her bed and breakfast in Utah</a>, which also seems to be doing very well.</p>



<p>Kody has been involved with those kinds of schemes in the past, but right now it looks like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-does-he-really-sell-guns-as-a-side-hustle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he&#8217;s involved in gun sales</a>.</p>



<p>Robyn &#8230; well, she&#8217;s there, too.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting that even though Robyn is the only one of the wives who doesn&#8217;t make any real additional income for the family, she&#8217;s the only one of Kody&#8217;s current wives to own a house.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Yep, while Christine&#8217;s a homeowner in Utah, she obviously did that on her own now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/robyn-brown-blasts-christine-she-blew-up-our-family-the-damage-will-be-ever-lasting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she&#8217;s divorced from Kody</a>, and Meri and Janelle both rent homes in Flagstaff.</p>



<p>And now, thanks to some enlightening moments from the show, we know how that all came to be.</p>



<p>This season, we saw Janelle lose her rental home when the owner decided to sell and then buy an RV so that she could live out on Coyote Pass and hopefully get going on building her home there.</p>



<p>When the first sale for Christine&#8217;s house fell through after she left for Utah, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-im-going-to-turn-on-janelle-now-that-christine-is-gone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody urged Janelle to buy it</a>, but she wouldn&#8217;t saying she doesn&#8217;t have enough money to build her house and buy that one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But it turns out that she may have been able to afford both &#8230; if she hadn&#8217;t give half of the money from the sale of her Las Vegas house to help buy Robyn&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>Shockingly, in the most recent episode we learned that Meri did something similar, except she gave up <em>all</em> the money she made from her Vegas house to Robyn.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all money that would have gone into Janelle and Meri&#8217;s respective personal accounts &#8212; Kody took money from the family&#8217;s joint account to buy the house, too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>To be fair, Robyn was initially very uncomfortable with buying the $900k mansion she and Kody currently live in &#8212; she was very anxious about it and repeatedly said that she wanted to rent so they could focus their resources on Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>But, you know, she owns a house that&#8217;s worth over a million dollars now.</p>



<p>And meanwhile, Meri&#8217;s still renting a house while Janelle&#8217;s renting an apartment, and there&#8217;s still nothing happening with Coyote Pass.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Meri seems to be fine with this, which makes sense &#8212; <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/05/meri-browns-net-worth-leaves-sister-wives-fans-in-shock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she seriously makes so much money</a> selling ugly clothes, she&#8217;s going to be fine regardless.</p>



<p>Janelle, however, appears to have some regrets, considering the only assets she has now are her RV and her bit of land on Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>Oh, and by the way, this feels like a good time to mention that Robyn&#8217;s part of the property is considerably larger than Janelle&#8217;s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Earlier this month, Gwen, Christine&#8217;s daughter, apparently let it slip that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/janelle-brown-has-left-kody-reliable-sister-wives-insider-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meri and Robyn were the only wives that Kody had left</a>, and that was following months of rumors that Janelle had left him.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s hope for Janelle&#8217;s sake that she really did &#8212; because wow, what an unfair position to be in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 5</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Kody Brown has been absolutely unbearable to watch during this season of Sister Wives.</p>



<p>And yeah, that&#8217;s been true for every season, but <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-nobody-likes-me-and-im-ashamed-of-myself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he&#8217;s extra awful this time around</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen him <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-i-was-only-intimate-with-christine-out-obligation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be mean and thoughtless</a> towards family members, we&#8217;ve seen him completely refuse to see anything from anyone else&#8217;s point of view.</p>



<p>And now, in a new sneak peek of the upcoming episode, we&#8217;re seeing him take <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-screams-at-christine-you-stabbed-me-right-in-the-kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the anger he&#8217;d been directing at Christine</a> and turning it on Janelle.</p>



<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t the first time the two of them have had their issues.</p>



<p>Things have been rocky between them ever since the beginning of the pandemic, with <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/janelle-brown-tells-husband-kody-to-f-k-off-in-stunning-new-sist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle infamously telling him to &#8220;f-ck off&#8221;</a> in an episode last season over his intense rules.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Before the show even began, she once left the family for two years after becoming overwhelmed with the whole situation.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s not exactly a surprise that the two are at each other&#8217;s throats in this clip, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/sister-wives-janelle-argues-with-kody-over-not-wanting-to-live-in-christines-house-exclusive-194866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> exclusively by ET Online.</p>



<p>In the sneak peek, Kody is once again taking issue with Janelle&#8217;s decision to buy an RV to park on their land, Coyote Pass, so she could focus her resources on building her home there, as the family had originally planned.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve watched this season, then you know that he was deeply offended that she didn&#8217;t consult him with her decision, even though it seems like he rarely spends time with her anyway.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The problem here is that the sale of Christine&#8217;s house fell through &#8212; and he has a pretty strong opinion on what move the family should make next.</p>



<p>&#8220;We build on Coyote Pass, you move into that house, we rent this house,&#8221; he explains in a confessional.</p>



<p>Essentially he wants Janelle to purchase Christine&#8217;s old house to live in while she builds her house out on their land, and after she moves out there they rent out the other home for additional income.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan with Robyn&#8217;s house,&#8221; he insists.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Janelle, however, doesn&#8217;t like that plan.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just &#8230; my heart &#8230; I want a house,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to be settled in my own house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, but we&#8217;re a year from that,&#8221; he argues, &#8220;even if we start building right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But Kody, I don&#8217;t think I can do both,&#8221; she tells him, which is obviously fair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>In a confessional of her own, she explains that she can&#8217;t afford mortgages for two houses, plain and simple.</p>



<p>Back in their conversation, Kody stumbles around his words, trying to tell her how it would be possible for both things to happen &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t come up with much.</p>



<p>Janelle then tells him that she&#8217;s spoken to their mortgage guy, who told her that it would take two years of renting Christine&#8217;s old home &#8220;before somebody would not count that mortgage towards your debt to income when you&#8217;re trying to finance something else.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>So, you know, that&#8217;s not good.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want this house,&#8221; she says, clearly exasperated. &#8220;I want to be out on the property, that&#8217;s the whole reason I&#8217;ve been doing everything I&#8217;ve been doing, I want to be out there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I still don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re being open-minded,&#8221; he says, seemingly teasing her.</p>



<p>She starts to get more frustrated, telling him again that she&#8217;s talked to the mortgage guy, and his response is &#8220;I know, he says two years, so what?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-takes-no-responsibility-at-all-for-failed-marriage-to-christine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Really productive discussion</a>, huh?</p>



<p>&#8220;Kody, the problem is I wouldn&#8217;t be able to build,&#8221; Janelle tries to explain. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even get a construction loan if I buy this house.&#8221;</p>



<p>As usual, Kody goes back to the RV, saying that if she hadn&#8217;t bought that then she would&#8217;ve been able to afford the mortgage as well as the building of the home on Coyote Pass.</p>



<p>He suggests that they pay off the land this year, then start building next year, which frustrates Janelle even more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;No, God!&#8221; she exclaims. &#8220;Kody, it&#8217;s like everybody&#8217;s lost sight of the reason we moved here, was to build out there.&#8221;</p>



<p>He assures her that he knows that, he just sees that buying Christine&#8217;s house would be adding an asset to the family.</p>



<p>Making another good point, she reminds him that it would take two years of someone else living in the house and paying rent before she would be able to get a loan to build on Coyote Pass, &#8220;so where am I gonna live for the two years we&#8217;re renting this?&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Back in his confessional, Kody admits that he&#8217;s being &#8220;creative and a little bit argumentative with Janelle,&#8221; but his main point is that he just wants &#8220;to get her into a home, and Christine&#8217;s house is here and available and easy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The whole thing is really just annoying as a viewer, Janelle trying to explain over and over that buying Christine&#8217;s house would delay building on their land for at least two more years and Kody insisting that somehow, someway, they can manage to do both.</p>



<p>Seeing this kind of pointless arguing along with all the arguments they&#8217;ve had over the past couple of years, it makes sense that there are rumors upon rumors that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/janelle-brown-did-christine-force-her-to-leave-kody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle has officially left him</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>And remember, Gwendlyn Brown, Christine&#8217;s daughter, apparently confirmed that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/janelle-brown-has-left-kody-reliable-sister-wives-insider-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meri and Robyn are the only wives Kody has left</a> &#8230;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s really not that difficult to imagine why this guy&#8217;s wives would want to get as far away from him as possible, huh?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been watching this season of Sister Wives, then you know that much of it has been about Christine Brown&#8217;s decision to leave Kody.</p>



<p>You would also know that Kody hasn&#8217;t been exactly graceful in handling the split.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen him be in denial about the situation, we&#8217;ve seen him <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-screams-at-christine-you-stabbed-me-right-in-the-kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scream and cry about it</a> &#8230;</p>



<p>It hasn&#8217;t been pretty.</p>



<p>In last week&#8217;s episode, we saw Christine get together with Kody, Meri, Janelle, and Robyn to drop the big news that she&#8217;d sold her house and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/christine-brown-to-kody-im-moving-back-to-utah-deal-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be moving to Utah</a> the next week.</p>



<p>Janelle was the only one who was supportive of her &#8212; Robyn did ask if Christine planned on remaining close to the adults in the family, but Christine told her she needed space for a while.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Meri wasn&#8217;t feeling much sympathy for her former sister wife at all, and Kody &#8230; well, he did <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-i-was-only-intimate-with-christine-out-obligation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of the screaming and crying</a> we talked about earlier.</p>



<p>Throughout this entire season, he&#8217;s been slamming Christine, playing the victim, and pretending like he has no real idea <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/kody-brown-insists-christine-ruined-our-marriage-not-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why she&#8217;d be upset enough to want to leave him</a>.</p>



<p>But in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sisterwives/videos/3041014436191634/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sneak peek</a> for this week&#8217;s episode, we finally see him be a little honest.</p>



<p>And honestly, it&#8217;s just as rough to watch as any other footage of him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>In the scene, we see Robyn and Kody sit down with Mykelti, Christine&#8217;s daughter, her husband Tony, and their baby girl, Avalon.</p>



<p>We know that Mykelti has always been close to Robyn, even living with her a bit at one point, and before the scene even begins we see Christine speaking to the camera, acknowledging that Mykelti has still been supportive of Robyn throughout all of this.</p>



<p>During the little family get-together, Robyn tells Mykelti &#8220;With everything going on with your mom and stuff like that, I just appreciate you coming.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I just want to make sure that no matter what&#8217;s happening there, we&#8217;re good,&#8221; she says, getting emotional.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still Mom, Robyn,&#8221; Mykelti kindly assures her, and Tony adds &#8220;And Grandma.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my biggest thing,&#8221; Robyn tells them, &#8220;that we&#8217;re all &#8230; that our relationship continues and it&#8217;s based on what goes on in our relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not based on outside sources,&#8221; Mykelti assures her.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Kody, physically incapable of allowing a nice moment to happen in his presence, interjects with &#8220;It feels like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-takes-no-responsibility-at-all-for-failed-marriage-to-christine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything&#8217;s affected my relationship with everybody</a> though.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mykelti gives a subtle eyeroll, and then we&#8217;re treated to a conversation between Kody and TLC cameras.</p>



<p>&#8220;When it comes to raising kids and dealing with things like this,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m almost always &#8216;bad cop.&#8217; So my relationship, I feel like, is somewhat strained with a lot of my kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yeah, we&#8217;re sure <em>that&#8217;s</em> the reason why <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-takes-no-responsibility-at-all-for-failed-marriage-to-christine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so many of those relationships are strained</a>, bud.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Back with the whole crew, Robyn asks Mykelti if she&#8217;s doing OK with the whole Christine situation, and she told her that while it&#8217;s sad when any family breaks up, &#8220;if that&#8217;s what she wants, then I think it&#8217;s important to support what she wants.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kody asks her how long she&#8217;s known about Christine&#8217;s decision to leave, once again making things uncomfortable.</p>



<p>Mykelti stumbles for a bit, and Kody specifically asks her if Christine had been talking about leaving before she told him.</p>



<p>&#8220;She was talking about it,&#8221; she admits. &#8220;She&#8217;s been talking about it for a while, but I think most of what she&#8217;s been talking about is what anyone talks about in a relationship &#8212; the ups and the downs, the highs and the lows.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Back in the confessional, Kody shows a rare moment of clarity, saying &#8220;I know that I can&#8217;t sh-t talk Christine to my kids, I don&#8217;t want to sh-t talk her at all even though that&#8217;s my natural urge, is to do that, I have to control that because that&#8217;s not fair.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m catching myself in this moment here where I&#8217;m saying &#8216;Well, how long have you guys known?&#8217;, and that&#8217;s a blame game that I&#8217;m playing and I feel ashamed that I&#8217;m doing that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But in my broken-hearted state,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-i-dont-ever-want-to-see-christine-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the anger is just flowing here</a>. And nobody likes me.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Well, we&#8217;re glad he was the one who said it.</p>



<p>His behavior this whole season &#8212; and really for the entire series, but that&#8217;s a conversation for another day &#8212; has just been horrific.</p>



<p>His anger has been uncomfortable to watch just on television, we can&#8217;t imagine what it must have been like to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-blasts-christine-you-always-treated-robyn-like-dirt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deal with it in person</a>.</p>



<p>So yeah, of course no one likes him.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We really don&#8217;t want to get our hopes up here, but could there be a chance that this is a sign that he&#8217;s actually starting to become aware of how badly he&#8217;s been behaving?</p>



<p>Could he actually start making an effort to be a better, more understand person?</p>



<p>&#8230; Nah, probably not.</p>

<p>Last week, we got some pretty major news from the Sister Wives crew &#8230;</p>



<p>And that news was that Janelle Brown has officially left Kody.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Well, probably.</p>



<p>Maybe, anyway.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a pretty interesting situation, because the news didn&#8217;t come from some anonymous source or from some speculation about a social media post.</p>



<p>It came <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/janelle-brown-has-left-kody-reliable-sister-wives-insider-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly from a member of the family</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-460876" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-300x169.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-480x270.png 480w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-720x405.png 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-320x180.png 320w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-735x413.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-335x188.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-347x195.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-520x293.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-960x540.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02-1080x608.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1018_gwendlynbrown_02.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>



<p>Gwendlyn Brown, one of Christine&#8217;s daughters, did a TikTok Live with a friend, and during the live, she answered some questions from fans of the show.</p>



<p>Since there have been rumors for a while now that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/janelle-brown-jets-off-to-hawaii-fuels-rampant-divorce-speculation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janelle has left Kody</a>, someone asked Gwen if Robyn and Meri are the only wives that Kody has left.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I think,&#8221; she responded.</p>



<p>Gwen also gave some updates on the other ladies on the show &#8212; she said her mom is <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/christine-brown-im-single-and-im-ready-to-be-sexy-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing really well and is very happy</a>, that Meri is thriving with her friends, and that she&#8217;s not Robyn&#8217;s biggest fan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But of course, the most interesting tidbit was her apparent confirmation that Kody is now down to two wives.</p>



<p>And now that that cat is out of the bag, insiders are coming forward to offer more details on what happened.</p>



<p>One of those sources <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/6658280/sister-wives-janelle-brown-split-kody-christine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> The Sun that Christine &#8220;forced&#8221; Janelle to leave Kody.</p>



<p>Well, maybe not &#8220;forced&#8221; exactly, but &#8220;Janelle had no real reason to leave until Christine pointed it out to her.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;ve seen the past couple of seasons of Sister Wives, the split generally doesn&#8217;t come as a huge shock.</p>



<p>Janelle obviously got fed up with Kody, at one point even<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/12/janelle-brown-tells-husband-kody-to-f-k-off-in-stunning-new-sist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> telling him to &#8220;f-ck off,&#8221;</a> which is definitely something we&#8217;ve never heard from her before.</p>



<p>She really struggled with Kody&#8217;s strict COVID rules, especially when he demanded that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/my-father-has-torn-this-family-apart-kody-browns-son-screams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she kick her sons out of her house</a>.</p>



<p>Confirming that, the source said &#8220;COVID created a lot of [the separation]. It gave the sister wives comfort to know that they could be on their own.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Christine was the ringleader&nbsp;in showing that they don&#8217;t need Kody.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With all certainty,&#8221; this insider continued, &#8220;the final straw was in May or June. It was in the beginning of summer where it&#8217;s been completely dissolved between Janelle and Kody.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s no longer claiming to be his wife. She does not believe she&#8217;s part of the equation&nbsp;of marriage with Kody anymore. It&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it sounds like a huge issue was how Kody had been treating their children.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>&#8220;When your kids lose a relationship with a parent, you have to pick and choose,&#8221; and for Janelle, &#8220;her support system is not Kody, it will always be her kids.&#8221;</p>



<p>But thankfully, it seems like <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/christine-brown-and-janelle-brown-take-road-trip-continue-to-flaunt-their-friendship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she has some additional support</a> in her former sister wife, Christine.</p>



<p>&#8220;They have joined forces in supporting each other,&#8221; the source said.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a hard-core power trip. It&#8217;s antagonizing to Kody and <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-screams-at-christine-you-stabbed-me-right-in-the-kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he absolutely hates it</a>. They&#8217;re doing everything they can to go against Kody.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Incredible.</p>



<p>But this story isn&#8217;t over yet!</p>



<p>This insider claims that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/meri-brown-im-sticking-with-kody-and-thats-final-haters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although she&#8217;s said otherwise</a>, Meri wants to cut ties with Kody as well!</p>



<p>&#8220;Meri will never admit this but she has a contract to fulfill and that&#8217;s the only reason why she still shows up.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been sticking around for the contract,&#8221; the source claimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s where her paychecks are coming from. She&#8217;s not sitting around waiting for Kody nor will she ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>That part is a little harder to believe &#8212; it really does seem like Meri is content in doing her own thing and just hoping Kody comes back around.</p>



<p>But then again, she&#8217;s always been a business-minded person, so maybe she really is just making her money before she jumps ship.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Do you think Kody is truly down to just one wife?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve caught any episode of Sister Wives in the past, say, decade, then you&#8217;ve probably noticed that the relationship between Meri and Kody Brown is not the best.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve watched in the past five years, then you&#8217;ve probably noticed that it&#8217;s an absolute dumpster fire of a marriage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Things weren&#8217;t always this way &#8212; it seems like there may have been a time long ago when Kody was genuinely and deeply in love with his first wife.</p>



<p>They did have some issues early on in the show about Meri&#8217;s struggle with infertility.</p>



<p>They each went back and forth on whether or not to get medical help with conceiving essentially until it was too late for her to have another child.</p>



<p>But when things really fell apart, of course, was when <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/05/meri-brown-catfish-scandal-gets-even-worse-for-sister-wives-star/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meri was catfished</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>The family tried to focus on the catfish angle &#8212; that she was being deceived by someone and was a victim &#8212; but it&#8217;s important to remember that Meri did think she was talking to another man.</p>



<p>And based on some of the details that were leaked, it seemed pretty clear that she was <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/03/meri-brown-catfish-scandal-sexually-graphic-voicemails-photos-to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking to him with romantic intentions</a>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all it was, just talking, but still, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/kody-brown-i-will-never-sleep-with-meri-again-not-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody felt deeply betrayed</a> by the whole thing, and he hasn&#8217;t seen Meri in the same way since.</p>



<p>In the past few seasons, we&#8217;ve learned that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/meri-brown-its-been-10-years-im-dying-to-sleep-with-kody-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they haven&#8217;t had sex in over a decade</a>, he sees her as more of a friend, and he doesn&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll ever be able to have an actual marriage ever again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>He&#8217;s recently gone as far as to say that he <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/kody-brown-meri-who-im-not-even-married-to-that-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn&#8217;t even consider them married anymore</a> at all.</p>



<p>But despite Kody&#8217;s harsh words and horrific attitude, she&#8217;s made it clear that she&#8217;s not going anywhere.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s said that she still has hope that things can improve, and that she&#8217;s prayed about it and believes that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/11/meri-brown-god-wants-me-to-be-with-kody-okay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God wants her to stay</a> with Kody.</p>



<p>And in her latest Instagram post, it seems like she&#8217;s done even more thinking on the matter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Along with a selfie she took on a plane, she wrote that she&#8217;s &#8220;Just a girl who&#8217;s excited to go home!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In the past 23 days, I&#8217;ve been home a total of 36 hours,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Not complaining, I have a good life!&#8221;</p>



<p>She went on to write &#8220;I&#8217;ve experienced fabulous adventures, amazing business trainings, intense and massive personal growth.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done some soul searching, accepted things that needed to be accepted, pivoted where I needed to pivot. I&#8217;ve had cheerleaders cheer for me, friends surround me with their joy, spread a little happiness and light of my own.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;THIS is what makes me happy,&#8221; Meri insisted, &#8220;doing all the things, living this life that I&#8217;ve been blessed with to the fullest, given when and where I can, and experiencing joy!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is where I thrive, this is what I will continue!&#8221; she finished.</p>



<p>So while this is a new message from her, it&#8217;s the same kind of thing she&#8217;s been saying for a while now.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s happy! She&#8217;s blessed! She doesn&#8217;t have any problems, least of all in her marriage!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption>Meri Brown is enjoying her time in the dessert in this photo from early fall 2022.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Everything is fine! Everything is beautiful! Everything is awesome!</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for drama or a crumbling marriage, then look elsewhere, because you are certainly not going to find anything like that with her.</p>



<p>&#8230; You believe her, right?</p>

<p>Teen Mom fans know that drama is just of the fun when it comes to this very special series.</p>



<p>But this latest drama is &#8230; well, it&#8217;s a lot.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Settle in, because this could take a while.</p>



<p>OK, so we know that during the taping of Teen Mom Family Reunion, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-and-ashley-jones-fight-during-teen-mom-taping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fight broke out</a> between Briana DeJesus, Ashley Jones, and both of their mothers.</p>



<p>It all started because Briana&#8217;s mom, Roxanne, made a comment one night about how the grandmothers on the show should have each other&#8217;s backs.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>Tea, Ashley&#8217;s mom, took that personally, and it turned out that Roxanne was insinuating, at least partially, that she didn&#8217;t appreciate some of the things Tea had posted on social media.</p>



<p>The two ladies started screaming at each other and tried to turn things physical, but security managed to calm things down &#8230; for the moment. </p>



<p>Later that night, all four of them found themselves in the kitchen together, and that&#8217;s when Ashley allegedly spit on Briana.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/09/briana-dejesus-i-did-not-try-to-beat-up-pregnant-ashley-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Things did get more violent this time around</a>, but we won&#8217;t know the full extent until the episode airs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>We do know that Ashley, Briana, and their mothers were forced to leave the show early, and that the feud continued on social media afterwards.</p>



<p>It was a lot at the time, but last weekend MTV filmed the reunion special for both Family Reunion and The Next Chapter &#8230;</p>



<p>And you won&#8217;t believe what a mess it was.</p>



<p>According to sources who <a href="https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2022/10/28/exclusive-walk-offs-angry-twerking-arguments-more-all-the-behind-the-scenes-details-from-last-weekends-teen-mom-reunion-tapings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> with The Ashley&#8217;s Reality Roundup, &#8220;tensions were high&#8221; from the beginning because of everything that had happened before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>When it was time to film the segment with the whole cast, “Briana was told that Ashley would be on-stage with her,&#8221; but she was assured that &#8220;that they would seat Ashley far away from Briana.&#8221;</p>



<p>“When Briana saw that Ashley wasn’t actually very far from her on stage, Briana walked off and told [the producers] that she didn’t feel comfortable,&#8221; the source explained.</p>



<p>“The producers tried to get Briana to go back out there with Ashley but she refused and told them she didn’t feel safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was all that happened during the taping of the reunion for The Next Chapter, but something strange happened when they began filming for Family Reunion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“Ashley wasn’t allowed on the set anywhere near any of the other girls for the ‘Family Reunion’ taping,” a source said</p>



<p>.“They said she was banned for ‘legal reasons’ and everyone assumed it’s because [the fight] happened on the ‘Family Reunion’ set. It was just so weird that the day before Ashley was allowed near everyone.” </p>



<p>The Ashley theorized that the shows were produced by different companies there could have been different rules, and that makes sense.</p>



<p>But what happened later, well, that doesn&#8217;t make sense at all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="598" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-1024x598.png" alt="Ashley Jones Replaces Chelsea Houska, Shares First Teen Mom 2 &quot;OMG&quot; Moment" class="wp-image-403727" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-1024x598.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-300x175.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-768x448.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-735x429.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-335x196.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-347x203.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-520x304.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-640x374.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee-960x561.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/04/ashley-jones-officially-replaces-chelsea-houska-shares-first-tee.png 1072w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>



<p>After the cast finished filming for the day, &#8220;all the girls other than Ashley got into two vans to leave the set.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They passed Ashley on their way out and she realized who was in the vans. That’s when she began doing her signature twerking moves at the second van.&#8221;</p>



<p>Signature twerking moves. You can&#8217;t make this stuff up.</p>



<p>“A lot of the girls found it super-disrespectful and it really angered one girl in particular, someone who had not had any previous disagreements with Ashley and had previously liked her,&#8221; the source continued.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>“That girl confronted Ashley later on the phone and that conversation ended in a huge argument. No one got physical but it probably would have if the conversation had been in-person.&#8221;</p>



<p>That person, shockingly enough, was Amber Portwood.</p>



<p>(JK, it&#8217;s not shocking at all, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/07/amber-portwood-arrested-on-felony-domestic-battery-charges-yikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber got felony charges</a> over Fourth of July fireworks, why wouldn&#8217;t someone twerking make her lose it?)</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="461" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction.png" alt="Amber Portwood Reaction" class="wp-image-323865" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction.png 492w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction-300x281.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction-335x314.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/amber-portwood-reaction-347x325.png 347w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /><figcaption>(MTV)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ashley and her husband, Bar, explained later that he was simply filming her twerking for a TikTok, which checks out &#8212; there is a video on her account of her lip syncing and doing a little shimmying in what appears to be the outside of the production studio.</p>



<p>That makes infinitely more sense &#8212; why would she twerk at the Teen Mom cast aggressively? Why would anyone think that&#8217;s what she was doing?</p>



<p>Seriously, just think about it for a minute: you are walking away from your archenemy but before you get out of their line of sight, they start twerking in your direction as a sign of great disrespect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Is that real life, or is that a bunch of people who don&#8217;t like one girl making up reasons to bash her?</p>



<p>Look, Ashley isn&#8217;t perfect, of course, but what kind of world do we live in if we can&#8217;t even twerk for TikTok without it turning into this?</p>



<p>Anyway, about that phone call that Amber made to Ashley &#8230;</p>



<p>Yeah, Ashley shared clips of it on Instagram.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s a little hard to understand what Amber said because she was absolutely just screaming her head off, but she did call Ashley a &#8220;dumb f-cking c-nt.&#8221; </p>



<p>She also told her that she was &#8220;going to be off the motherf-cking show,&#8221; meaning Amber thinks she can get Ashley fired, and of course she told her &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna f-ck your ass up if you ever say anything to my motherf-cking face.&#8221;</p>



<p>In what should become a classic Teen Mom quote, when Ashley told Amber that she was deranged, Amber agreed, saying &#8220;I am deranged, you dumb motherf-cker: clinically deranged.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="670" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1024x670.png" alt="Amber Portwood Bares Her Soul" class="wp-image-415652" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1024x670.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-300x196.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-768x503.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1536x1006.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-735x481.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-335x219.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-347x227.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-520x340.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-640x419.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-960x629.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul-1080x707.png 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/amber-portwood-bares-her-soul.png 1645w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re sure there will be more developments in this story, but for now &#8230; what a wild ride, huh?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Meri Brown lives a weird kind of double life.</p>



<p>In one life, the life she documents on social media, she&#8217;s super happy, travels all the time, has good friends, and is just pumped to be alive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>But in the other life, the one we see on Sister Wives &#8230; well, it&#8217;s kind of the opposite.</p>



<p>We see her get upset pretty frequently on the show about several things, and if she&#8217;s not upset, she&#8217;s trying to be nonchalant about the fact that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/meri-brown-kody-gave-up-on-me-but-im-cool-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kody clearly doesn&#8217;t want anything to do with her</a>.</p>



<p>Like, she&#8217;s admitted that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/01/meri-brown-its-been-10-years-im-dying-to-sleep-with-kody-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they haven&#8217;t slept together in over a decade</a>, and he&#8217;s made it very clear that he&#8217;s no longer in love with her and can&#8217;t imagine that ever changing.</p>



<p>Still, they stick together because &#8230; um &#8230; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Well, Meri says that she prays about it and that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/03/meri-brown-i-surrender-myself-to-god-and-im-ready-to-move-forwar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God tells her to stick it out</a>, so it looks like she&#8217;s just going to hang out until God tells her something different.</p>



<p>But just a few days ago, Kody&#8217;s first wife made yet another attempt to convince us all that despite everything, she&#8217;s really, truly content with her life.</p>



<p>Bless her heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me!&#8221; her message began. &#8220;Just over here enjoying my life!&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;I work hard and I play hard,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I live life happy and to the fullest. I celebrate my wins, I cheer my people on. I don&#8217;t let things get me down, at least not for long. (We all need to take a breather once in a while lol!)&#8221;</p>



<p>To her followers, she wrote &#8220;Listen friends, you are worth DOING what you want, GETTING what you want, LIVING how you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t feel like you can right now? That&#8217;s ok! Get up every day with the passion to work for it! Life isn&#8217;t always easy, we gotta work for the things we want. It&#8217;s not handed on a silver platter.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But how cool is that?!&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It only means YOU are in control of the outcome!&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>



<p>&#8220;Now go out and do something great,&#8221; she finished, &#8220;because YOU are worth it!&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s nice, right?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, judging by the kinds of comments her followers left, not too many people are buying it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you really happy?&#8221; one person asked. &#8220;Or just <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/meri-brown-defends-her-non-divorce-im-doing-what-i-want-thank-you-very-much/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">settling for no love</a>. You never seem happy to me.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>Another person wrote &#8220;Real self love is shown by good self care, good situations, and rewarding relationships, not IG posts. Just saying.&#8221;</p>



<p>One harsher comment read &#8220;Listen up 3rd wheel. You have been in a divided &#8216;family&#8217; and toxic marriage not marriage for decades. Christine is living your words, not you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Man, that&#8217;s got to sting, huh?</p>



<p>Meri hasn&#8217;t been very supportive of Christine&#8217;s decision to leave Kody, but it&#8217;s been beyond clear that <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/christine-brown-says-her-kids-are-soooooo-glad-she-left-kody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine is genuinely happy now</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure>



<p>And no, we can&#8217;t really say the same for Meri.</p>



<p>As one person put it, &#8220;Christine deserved your support as a woman- not pressure and condemnation to stay with a man who didn’t love her. Here’s hoping you move on too so you don’t need this endless rhetoric.&#8221;</p>
