<p>So far, all we&#8217;ve seen from <em>Transformers 4</em> is a series of nicely staged car pics.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another! This one is a <a href="http://www.moviefanatic.com/2013/06/transformers-4-truck-image-arrives/">2014 Argosy truck</a> from Freightliner:</p>

            <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
          
<p>Mark Wahlberg stars in the first film of the new action trilogy, with Kelsey Grammer taking the role of the main villain.</p>
<p>Stanley Tucci, Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor, Li Bingbing, and T.J. Miller also star.</p>
<p>Michael Bay returns to direct the film, which will premiere June 27, 2014 (unless my car picture theory is correct, in which case it will premiere&#8230;NEVER!).</p>

<p>1. Buy the chocolate from a store.</p>
<p>2. Ask the person for the chocolate.</p>
<p>Stacy Martin and Sophie Kennedy Clark decide to go with the oldest bartering method in the first <a href="http://www.moviefanatic.com/2013/06/nymphomaniac-clip-sex-for-chocolate/">clip from Lars Von Trier&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>Nymphomaniac</em></a>:</p>

<p>The film follows a woman, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, as she recounts her sex-addicted past to a man who saves her life.</p>

<p>Shia LaBeouf, Jamie Bell, Connie Nielsen, Christian Slater, Uma Thurman, Willem Dafoe, Jean-Marc Barr, and Udo Kier.</p>
<p>The film will be split into eight chapters covering two films. The film does contain graphic sex scenes, and may be released in both a hardcore and softcore version.</p>
<p><em>Nymphomaniac</em> premieres in Denmark on Christmas Eve, but no U.S. release date has yet been set.</p>

<p>After he insisted he didn&#8217;t want to direct any more Bond films, Mendes had reportedly signed on to helm <em>Bond 24</em>, and was even working on a deal for <em>Bond 25</em>.</p>
<p>But, that no longer seems to be the case.</p>
<p>During a red carpet event for the opening of his West End theatrical production of <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, Mendes insisted he&#8217;s been too focused on the new play to deal with <em>Bond</em>.</p>

<p>When asked about his involvement with the <a href="http://www.moviefanatic.com/2013/06/sam-mendes-not-locked-down-for-bond-24/">next Bond film, Mendes</a> said &#8220;I don’t know yet. I’m in discussion over the ‘B’ word and I won’t make any decision until this [play] is open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Mendes is directing it, we do know that Daniel Craig will return to play 007.</p>
<p>We also know about the sexy new <a href="http://www.moviefanatic.com/2013/06/penelope-cruz-to-play-bond-girl-in-bond-24/">Bond girl: Penelope Cruz</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good enough for now.</p>

<p>And no, it&#8217;s not about <a href="/2013/06/kim-kardashian-baby-pics-fooled-you/">Kanye and Kim&#8217;s kid</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Had to.</p>
<p>Watch the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moviefanatic.com/2013/06/hell-baby-trailer-a-tiny-little-bundle-of-terror/"><em>Hell Baby</em> trailer</a> below:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/hell-baby-trailer"></a></figure>
<p>Rob Corddry and Leslie Bibb star as a couple who move into a haunted New Orleans mansion.</p>
<p>When Bibb&#8217;s character becomes possessed, they enlist the help of a pair of Vatican exorcists, played by writer/directors Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;">
	<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>Keegan Michael Key, Riki Lindhome, Paul Scheer, and Rob Huebel also star.</p>
<p><em>Hell Baby</em> looks like a very silly, very hilarious comedy in the tradition of Garant and Lennon&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>Reno 911</em>. Should be fun!</p>
<p>See it in theaters September 6, or get it on iTunes July 25!</p>
