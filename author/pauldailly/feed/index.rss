<p>One of Big Brother&#8217;s most controversial seasons wrapped Sunday on CBS, but who left the house $750,000 richer? </p>



<p>At the top of the two-hour finale, Monte, Taylor, and Turner remained in the running, and there was no guessing who would win. </p>



<p>All three had solid cases for winning, highlighting that they all played the game but had very different styles of play. </p>

<p>Taylor had the most challenging road to the finale because she was targeted from the first week, and viewers got much satisfaction from watching everyone who wanted her out going home first. </p>



<p>Taylor was great at the social aspect of the game and managed to bounce back from much adversity. She was resilient and won competitions when she needed to. </p>



<p>Monte had a strong social game, but some of his decisions rubbed the jurors the wrong way. The same can be said for Turner, meaning that it would all come down to who won the final head of household competition. </p>



<p>The first part found the houseguests holding on for dear life to an oversized hot dog. </p>

<p><strong>Turner won the first part of the HOH competition. </strong></p>



<p>That meant Taylor and Monte had to face off in the second part, with Monte securing the win. </p>



<p>It was a close race and one that could change the trajectory of the finale. </p>



<p>Taylor was understandably livid at not being able to play in the final part, but thankfully for her, Monte won. </p>



<p>&#8220;I could not be more excited in this moment, and I&#8217;m pretty sure both of us are gonna take each other to the very end,&#8221; Turner said, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;So this could not be any better.&#8221;</p>



<p>Turner emphasized that he had a final two with Monte from the beginning of the game. </p>



<p>Surely that meant Monte would take him to the end, right?</p>



<p>WRONG. </p>



<p>In the end, Monte won and decided to sit next to Taylor at the final two. </p>



<p>Before we got to the jury&#8217;s thoughts on the houseguests, Dr. Will Turner returned and noted how strong the final three were. </p>

<p>It seemed like it was a split decision because everyone knew there were different playstyles, and not all of them agreed with the decisions. </p>



<p>&#8220;The difference between Taylor and Turner is that there&#8217;s strategy between Taylor&#8217;s moves,&#8221; Joseph said as he defended Taylor. </p>



<p>&#8220;Turner is just attaching to someone and moving behind their shadow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kyle agreed that Taylor came off the block in a better position every time she was nominated. </p>



<p>Turner revealed to Julie that he was shocked about being cut by Monte but maintained he was &#8220;not mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jury questions highlighted that Taylor had a firmer grip on the game than some of the others thought. </p>



<p>&#8220;Being on the block can be something that is seen as a very weak game,&#8221; said Taylor.</p>

<p>Big Brother is in the final stages of its 24th season. </p>



<p>As a result, Thursday&#8217;s eviction episode kicked off predictably, with Terrance and Alyssa on the block. </p>



<p>Terrance has not been the greatest player. He failed to utilize his little power in the game to make any big moves.</p>

<p>But, he was still a bigger target than someone like Alyssa, who had not won a single competition. </p>



<p>Then again, winning any competition in the house when a competition beast like Michael is playing is tough. </p>



<p>There was a lack of chaos throughout the first round of the episode. Michael was HOH, and he had a clear target in Terrance. </p>



<p>Brittany was desperate to get a bigger target out of the house, but Michael was apprehensive because of the deal he made with Turner last week. </p>



<p>Terrance wanted to work with Taylor and Monte, if the edit is to be believed, while Alyssa wanted to work with the girls if she could stay this week. </p>

<p>Ultimately, Terrance was evicted from the house and didn&#8217;t try to say goodbye. He waltzed out because he didn&#8217;t want to engage. </p>



<p>Monte and Turner conceded ahead of the eviction that aligning with Michael would allow them to get further into the game. </p>



<p>The tricky aspect here is that Michael wins EVERYTHING. He&#8217;s won the most Veto competitions in a single season and ties Janelle&#8217;s Big Brother All-Stars performance. </p>



<p>Keeping him in the house too long would be bad because anyone next to him at the finale would be playing for second place. </p>



<p>Before we got to the second eviction, we picked up with the Jury house. </p>

<p>Indy was shocked when Jasmine and Joseph arrived following the season&#8217;s first double eviction. </p>



<p>In one of the most surprising moments, Jasmine said she wanted Taylor to make it all the way, which is strange when you consider Jasmine&#8217;s treatment of her co-star. </p>



<p>Things took a shocking turn when Kyle arrived in the house and revealed all about what led to his eviction. </p>



<p>Understandably, the houseguests were surprised to see Kyle at the jury house. </p>



<p>He explained his comments earlier in the season in which he believed the POC contestants were working together without any evidence. </p>

<p>He confirmed he put these people together based on race. </p>



<p>Joseph, Indy, and Jasmine were all blindsided and visibly hurt by Kyle&#8217;s actions. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 2022, we have the internet, educate yourself,&#8221; Indy yelled at Kyle. </p>



<p>Jasmine said that she and Kyle had a lot in common, but after hearing his thought process, she understood they had zero in common. </p>

<p>Joseph was also hurt because he said that even in the end, he was thinking about ways to keep them both inside the house. </p>



<p>Julie dropped the double eviction bombshell back at the house, and everyone was scared. </p>



<p>Turner secured another HOH win &#8212; his third of the season! He put up Alyssa and Brittany but promised Alyssa that she would be safe. </p>



<p>The Veto competition arrived, and it was one of the most intense competitions of the summer. Michael is the undisputed Veto King, but even he struggled to get to grips with the competition. </p>



<p>Monte won, and things got utterly bonkers from that point on. Before the ad break, Monte told Alyssa he was taking her down and made a comment that it was time to take the shot at Michael. </p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t a bad plan because it will give Monte and Turner a fighting chance of winning the game. </p>



<p>Michael realized his game was in jeopardy, so he threw Brittany under the bus during his speech, revealing that she had been caught in several lies this week. </p>



<p>He said he&#8217;ll team up with Alyssa and Taylor to take out Monte and Turner. </p>



<p>In the end, Michael was sent packing, and now, there&#8217;s no predicting who will win the game. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a shocking week inside the Big Brother house, culminating in Kyle being sent to the block for comments about the POC players teaming up. </p>



<p>The broader issue with Kyle was that he didn&#8217;t admit to the behavior when he was on the spot. </p>



<p>He said as much to Brittany when he grilled her for telling people. He even lied that he hadn&#8217;t mentioned the Cookout alliance. </p>



<p></p>

<p>In a flashback, we got to see the conversation play out in its entirety. The editing was crafty, showcasing these conversations that had previously only been hinted at on the show. </p>



<p>As the houseguests tried to comprehend Kyle&#8217;s behavior, he turned to Terrance and Monte to explain his thought process. </p>



<p>He said he recognized that everyone in the Cookout alliance had a &#8220;why&#8221; for playing the game and that he had identified that &#8220;why&#8221; in the POC still in the house. </p>

<p>It was a shocking scene, but at least Kyle finally started to understand the magnitude of his actions. </p>



<p>Terrance was most upset at Kyle because Joseph was sent home last week due to Kyle&#8217;s lies. </p>



<p>Monte was upset because he and Kyle walked into the house together, and there was an immediate bond between them. </p>



<p>Monte opened up to Kyle about cutting ties with friends because of their racism. </p>

<p>While many reality series would have severed all ties with a contestant like Kyle, Big Brother elected to keep him in the house. </p>



<p>The episode was filled with conversations about race as Kyle went from denying his behavior to apologizing and seemingly wanting to learn from it. </p>



<p>Given the number of blackouts on the live feeds this week, it&#8217;s hard to tell whether we&#8217;re being given a true reflection of what happened in the house. </p>



<p>The series has largely avoided showing Kyle&#8217;s comments, which has not gone down well on social media. There&#8217;s no reason to protect Kyle. </p>



<p>For a series that boasts that it brings people from all walks of life together, it sure likes to gaslight its audience into thinking the villains are the heroes. </p>

<p>It makes you wonder how this season would be received without a live feed. </p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the Michael and Brittany of it all. The timing of them coming clean about Kyle feels more like a game move. </p>



<p>Brittany was on the block, and their number one, Taylor, was also in danger. Thankfully, Terrance, Monte, and Turner were aware of that. </p>



<p>Terrance called the pair out during a house meeting. Brittany said this wouldn&#8217;t benefit her game, but she did understand the optics of the timing.</p>



<p>They both apologized, but something tells me the delay in telling the truth will come back to bite them.</p>



<p>At the Veto meeting, Kyle was put on the block when Michael saved Brittany. </p>

<p>As expected, Kyle was evicted by a vote of 5-0. </p>



<p>The game is at quite the tipping point. Many people are upset at Michael and Brittany, meaning they could be targeted if they don&#8217;t win the Head of Household. </p>



<p>Then again, a double eviction is coming up, so the game may shift significantly. </p>



<p>Big Brother continues Sundays at 8 p.m. on CBS. </p>

<p>Big Brother has been criticized throughout its 24th season for cherry-picking what to show on the episodes. </p>



<p>The live feeds of late have shown Kyle Capener making problematic statements that have been primarily been omitted from the series. </p>



<p>There has been an uprising from fans to get this shown on TV because casual viewers are being given a different interpretation of Kyle as a person. </p>

<p>That came to a grinding halt on Wednesday&#8217;s new episode. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll start at the top. We picked up with Taylor and Brittany on the block, thanks to Turner. </p>



<p>Turner tried to play it cool, revealing that Joseph spilled the beans about the final three that did not include him. </p>



<p>Viewers know Joseph did expose some parts of the alliance, but Kyle started first. </p>

<p>From a strategic standpoint, Turner&#8217;s decision makes, but it also detracts from the fact that everyone is making side deals as we approach the homestretch of the game. </p>



<p>Taylor and Joseph were close in the house, so she found it difficult to comprehend why he would throw her under the bus. </p>



<p>Taylor did admit to Turner that deals for the end had been discussed, but nothing was golden. Taylor was open and honest, but Turner can use anything to get what he wants at this stage.</p>

<p>As for Kyle, he finally started the process of telling Monte about what really happened during the Dyre Fest, including Joseph not being the one to bring up the Leftovers first. </p>



<p>Monte was not happy to learn that Kyle threw Joseph under the bus. Joseph was Monte&#8217;s number one, and he had been struggling to understand why his friend went so low. </p>



<p>Michael and Brittany turned to Taylor and Monte to tell them about Kyle&#8217;s problematic behavior. For those who don&#8217;t know, Kyle said he was worried about Monte, Taylor, Indy, Joseph, Jasmine, and Terrance forming an alliance because it looks &#8220;really similar to The Cookout.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kyle had no evidence to suggest these people were joining an alliance, which apparently made Michael and Brittany question his motives. </p>

<p>The surprising part is that Michael and Brittany have had that information for several weeks and only decided to use it when one of them was on the block. </p>



<p>Convenient, right?</p>



<p>Kyle&#8217;s comments only just starting to make it to the edits are a part of a wider problem with Big Brother. </p>



<p>Now, with the trajectory of the week hinting Michael and Brittany would expose what was really said, the editors are now giving some insight into how it went down. </p>



<p>Michael, as has been the norm this season, won the Veto. He&#8217;s dominating all the competitions. </p>

<p>Ahead of the Veto meeting, Michael and Brittany went to HOH Turner with all of the information. </p>



<p>Turner was visibly shocked. Kyle is someone he&#8217;s worked with throughout the game, so it was hard for him to hear what was happening in the house. </p>



<p>The big question now is whether this will get Kyle on the block and whether CBS will air the house meeting in full. </p>



<p>Alyssa told Kyle what was being said, and he immediately rushed to the diary room and said that Michael and Brittany were twisting his words to benefit his game. </p>



<p>Will he self-evict? </p>



<p><strong>Big Brother continues Thursday at 9 p.m. on CBS.</strong></p>

<p>The split house twist played a number on the game. </p>



<p>Sunday&#8217;s new episode picked up with both sides of the house reconvening to assess the damage to alliances. </p>



<p>Brittany, Michael, Monte, and Taylor were both in shock when Alyssa returned from the outside. </p>

<p>That was when they realized that a member of their alliance had been sent packing. </p>



<p>As viewers already know, Kyle told Terrance and Alyssa ALL about the Leftovers, leading to the mission to target Joseph. </p>



<p>Now, Terrance, Alyssa, Kyle, and Turner returned to the main house as an alliance called the Afterparty. </p>



<p>They all wasted no time in throwing Joseph under the bus to give them a reason for evicting him. </p>

<p>As a result of all the uncertainty, the HOH competition was one of the most crucial of the season. </p>



<p>The contestants had to use tweezers to stack mini cans across five levels, and it was tough from the get-go. </p>



<p>Turner secured the win, but it really was one of the closest calls of the season. Everyone competing was close to winning. </p>



<p>With Turner having multiple alliances, there was no telling who he would target. </p>

<p>He wanted to keep the Leftovers safe, but he had also pledged allegiance to the Afterparty. </p>



<p>The HOH win meant he would be making enemies this week, regardless of which side he chose. </p>



<p>Early in the episode, he was happy enough to continue with the Leftovers. </p>



<p>The reason?</p>



<p>He was worried about how Alyssa and Terrance would keep him safe because they didn&#8217;t have the best track record with competitions. </p>

<p>Kyle got wind of this and immediately tried to turn Turner against the Leftovers. </p>



<p>Kyle understood his time was running out to get more of the Leftovers out of the house. Kyle is one of the most problematic contestants in years, and the sooner people realize what he&#8217;s been doing, the better.</p>



<p>As Turner conversed, Monte conceded that he would have a better shot at riding this game out with Kyle and Turner. </p>



<p>He recognized that Michael, Brittany, and Taylor could be working together on alliances that would take them deeper into the game. </p>

<p>As a result, Monte turned to Turner to pledge his allegiance, paving the way for the most surprising nominations yet. </p>



<p>At the ceremony, Turner nominated Taylor and Brittany, claiming that he heard about them making alliances that did not include him. </p>



<p>The two women were understandably blindsided because Turner told them the remaining Leftovers were still strong. </p>



<p>It raises many questions about the game&#8217;s state, but it&#8217;s hard not to think that there&#8217;s another angle being played here. </p>

<p>Michael is winning every competition he&#8217;s part of, so there&#8217;s a good chance he could find himself on the block if one of the nominees comes down. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll need to tune in to Big Brother on Wednesday at 8 p.m. to find out what happens. </p>

<p>Double eviction night rocked the Big Brother house Thursday night, but it was not your typical double eviction. </p>



<p>Last week, the house was split up, with Jasmine, Michael, Monte, Taylor, and Brittany inside as Big Brother Brochella. </p>



<p>We had Terrance, Kyle, Alyssa, Turner, and Joseph outside. </p>

<p>Brochella was an easy week, with the Leftovers targeting the non-Leftover in the game, Jasmine. </p>



<p>Outside, however, things were bonkers from the jump. Kyle wasted no time spilling everything about the Leftovers to Terrance. </p>



<p>He conveniently left out the fact that he was instrumental in the formation of this group. </p>



<p>Kyle had been plotting his exit from the Leftovers for weeks, largely because he struck up a relationship with Alyssa. </p>



<p>Plenty of great showmances have dominated the game of Big Brother, but this isn&#8217;t it. </p>



<p></p>

<p>They seem to be together in a house with limited options. They&#8217;re here to spend a few weeks in jury together as a summer fling and nothing more. </p>



<p>When we picked up with Dyrefest, Joseph was clearly shocked about Kyle throwing him under the bus. </p>



<p>This should have been an easy week, with Alyssa on the block and being sent packing, but Kyle&#8217;s scheming ruined all that. </p>



<p>Terrance maintained that pulling Turner from the block was to give him some options as we head into the eviction, but the dude has been scripted all week. </p>



<p>Every zinger he had in the Diary Room sounded like it was read from a script, and it&#8217;s not a good look for the show. </p>

<p>Joseph attempted to call out Kyle in front of the other four; honestly, it was tough to watch. </p>



<p>Kyle shut him down. Turner shut him down, but the most significant part of that was Alyssa. </p>



<p>She made comments about Joseph playing a game against her, but she failed to recognize that her boyfriend was doing that for the entire season. </p>



<p>It was &#8230; something. </p>



<p>Turner was another big surprise here. Joseph kept Turner&#8217;s name out of his mouth, but Turner effectively shunned his friend. </p>



<p></p>

<p>By the time we got to the eviction, you could tell Joseph was so done with the game and those four players. </p>



<p>Joseph became the first member of the Leftovers to be evicted, and he left the house gracefully. </p>



<p>It will make for a shocking week ahead, especially now that Turner, Alyssa, Terrance, and Kyle have joined forces to make a final four. </p>



<p>Back inside the house, Jasmine finally revealed what viewers had been thinking: </p>



<p>She had been using her ankle injury to advance further into the game. </p>



<p></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a bad idea, but her fellow houseguests recognized the inconsistencies in the weeks since. </p>



<p>Jasmine was evicted by a vote of 2-0 and pretty much ran out the door. </p>



<p>We are now down to the final eight, and the game is at a big tipping point. </p>



<p>Michael and Brittany have been playing the middle, so they should both be safe no matter who wins HOH. </p>

<p>However, if Kyle, Turner, or Alyssa win HOH, we should probably expect one or both of Monte and Taylor to hit the block. </p>



<p>Big Brother continues Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/08/big-brother-recap-the-leftovers-continue-to-dominate-the-game/">Leftovers have dominated</a> the first half of Big Brother Season 24, but all that came crashing down on Sunday&#8217;s new episode. </p>



<p>The episode kicked off with Michael and Terrance each as Head of Household. </p>



<p>Michael got to run Brochella, while Terrance got to run Dyrefest. </p>

<p>Michael chose Taylor, Monte, Brittany, and Jasmine to be a part of his festival, while Terrance went with Joseph, Alyssa, Kyle, and Turner. </p>



<p>Terrance immediately told Turner and Alyssa they would be safe this week, but he was open about figuring out what to do. </p>



<p>The Dyre Festival looked almost as horrid as Fyre Festival, with everyone being forced to sleep outside, use porta-potties, and even shower outside. </p>



<p>Back inside the house, Michael told viewers he picked Jasmine to be his target and the other three to protect them. </p>

<p>Jasmine asked Michael not to put her up because it&#8217;s her birthday week, and Michael says he thinks Monte should be the target. </p>



<p>Obviously, he&#8217;s only telling Jasmine what he thinks she wants to hear to stay in the game. </p>



<p>Monte told Michael he could put him on the block to make the week simpler; that way, it would be easier to keep the noms the same and for Taylor and Brittany to vote out Jasmine. </p>



<p>Jasmine hasn&#8217;t brought much to the game, so viewers probably won&#8217;t even notice if she gets the boot. </p>

<p>Outside the house, the Leftovers are imploding. Kyle told Alyssa the truth about the Leftovers. </p>



<p>It was shocking, but Alyssa understood why he didn&#8217;t tell her and the lengths he went to keep her off the block. </p>



<p>Kyle followed that up by telling Terrance the truth, claiming they could work together with Michael and Brittany, who also apparently want out of the Leftovers. </p>



<p>Terrance was understandably blindsided. He knew something was amiss in the house because all the backdoor targets were sent home. </p>

<p>His mission for the week was to even the odds and shake things up enough to secure his future in the game. </p>



<p>The tricky part is that Michael and Brittany may not be ready to ditch Taylor, Monte, and whoever survives from the outside. </p>



<p>Michael has managed to play both sides of the house very well and wins competitions, so anyone would want to work with him. </p>



<p>He stands a good chance of winning the game if he can get everyone into the jury without realizing he played both sides. </p>



<p>Michael went with Jasmine and Monte at the nomination ceremony, while Terrance went with Turner and Joseph. </p>

<p>You could tell Joseph knew he was the target because he barely had the energy to react to the decision. </p>



<p>On the other hand, Turner promised he would find a way to get Alyssa on the block, and he would come back gunning for Terrance. </p>



<p>Things are getting interesting, and it&#8217;s a surprise we haven&#8217;t had this kind of twist in the past. </p>



<p>Two simultaneous games of Big Brother kept the scheming flowing during the episode. </p>



<p>The series continues Wednesday at 8 p.m.</p>

<p>Julie Chen promised the latest twist would shake up the Big Brother game like never before. </p>



<p>However, the events leading up to the latest eviction and the introduction of the twist certainly changed the dynamics inside the house. </p>



<p>Thursday&#8217;s long-winded two-hour installment picked up with the Leftovers pondering their next move, and honestly, some of these people need to be more mindful of their actions. </p>

<p>Some of them seem to be blissfully unaware cameras are rolling 24/7. </p>



<p>Taylor was upset about Alyssa taking the trip during the Veto because the optics of her doing such a thing showed that she had good social standing in the game. </p>



<p>The strategy in getting Alyssa out is that Kyle will have someone outside the alliance as the numbers dwindle, something that would allow him to sail further into the game. </p>



<p>Kyle is also in a showmance with Alyssa, so she would be the natural target. </p>

<p>Kyle has his eggs in too many baskets here, and it&#8217;s starting to affect how he plays the game. </p>



<p>In true Kyle fashion, he went to cool things off with Alyssa but wound up solidifying their relationship by calling them, boyfriend and girlfriend. </p>



<p>This development, in turn, meant that he betrayed the Leftovers and kept the nominations the same. </p>



<p>&#8220;You were supposed to use the f&#8211;king Veto,&#8221; Taylor said to her onetime ally in the storage room after the ceremony. </p>



<p>While you could tell Taylor amped up her anger to make people outside the alliance believe her plan to target Monte was legit, she was understandably upset. </p>

<p>Kyle wants to be a part of the Leftovers, but he also wants to make connections with everyone else not to be the first member of that alliance sent out of the game. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a bad plan, but he shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if someone goes after him for playing all of these sides. </p>



<p>Another flaw in Kyle&#8217;s game is how he approached Michael and Brittany with a concern that the house&#8217;s BIPOC contestants will band together to get everyone else out of the house. </p>



<p>Kyle has been seen on the Big Brother live feed actively trying to make alliances that don&#8217;t include the BIPOC contestants. Hopefully, Michael or Brittany will relay his &#8220;concerns&#8221; to the other houseguests.</p>



<p>Kyle has been a problematic contestant from the get-go, and this is the first time the Big Brother episodes have actually addressed it. </p>

<p>Brittany tried to reason with Kyle in the episode, telling him they &#8220;can&#8217;t assume that would be the case&#8221; regarding the BIPOC houseguests joining forces. </p>



<p>This brings us to Michael. </p>



<p>He might be winning competitions, but his pursuit of playing in the middle of the house will come back to bite him when he least expects it. </p>



<p>The episode was almost over when we got to the eviction. </p>



<p>If Big Brother wants to do these extended episodes, we should be getting more content. </p>

<p>Indy was given the boot by a vote of 7-1, becoming the first member of the jury. </p>



<p>She was visibly upset and gave some bizarre speech about blocking people on socials if they say anything bad about her. </p>



<p>Ultimately, she didn&#8217;t blame Taylor for sending her out the door. She blamed Kyle for not using the Veto. </p>



<p>Julie then let the houseguests in on the big Twist:</p>



<p>Five houseguests would live inside the house, and five would be sent outside as two simultaneous games of Big Brother got underway. </p>

<p>Michael won the knockout-style HOH competition, and since Terrance managed second place, he also won. </p>



<p>Another point of note: Michael exposed the Leftovers to Indy in a goodbye message, which might win him some favor with jurors. </p>



<p>Big Brother continues Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS. </p>

<p>Big Brother viewers are often warned to expect the unexpected, and the people outside of the Leftovers alliance were left doing just that on Sunday&#8217;s new episode of Big Brother. </p>



<p>The new episode picked up with a highly-anticipated wall competition. Would the Leftovers reign supreme, or was it time for a power shift?</p>



<p>When the episode picked up, Michael was relegated to the presenter of the competition, which is a shame. This is the type of competition he would have dominated. </p>

<p>However, he does not need any other competition wins at this stage. </p>



<p>The competition started predictably, with Jasmine dropping off the wall. </p>



<p>It came down to Taylor, Joseph, and Kyle, all members of the Leftovers, but we learned some shocking information as the competition played out. </p>



<p>Kyle and Joseph joined an alliance with Indy, Alyssa, and Jasmine called the Fly Swatters. </p>

<p>Thankfully, this alliance was just a smoke screen, and the two boys knew their allegiance was to the Leftovers, but it was fun to see the three women think the men would win for them. </p>



<p>The fact is that the women in the house, sans Brittany, have all been awful to Taylor at various points in the game. </p>



<p>Taylor secured the all-important win, but unfortunately, her game could be a casualty of this win. </p>



<p>She quickly pondered her best course of action, and she declared that Jasmine would not touch the block because she didn&#8217;t want to target a Black woman. </p>

<p>Jasmine has been terrible to Taylor and would probably get Taylor out of the house if she could win a competition. </p>



<p>Terrance, who has criticized Taylor&#8217;s every move, tried to be in her ear, telling her he would support whatever she wanted to do. </p>



<p>What he didn&#8217;t know was that everyone had been telling her everything he said, so she was well aware of his true motives. </p>



<p>Taylor chatted with her allies about potential moves and floated the idea of Turner and Indy, and then Turner and Monte, in order to have a backdoor target. </p>

<p>The issue is that Taylor didn&#8217;t account for someone outside of the alliance winning the POV. That would have left two of her closest allies on the block. </p>



<p>Taylor had a crucial chat with Indy in which she told her she would likely put her up as a pawn. </p>



<p>Indy was visibly upset, but viewers at home know Indy has been anti-Taylor since the beginning, so maybe losing Indy on Taylor&#8217;s HOH wouldn&#8217;t be that bad. </p>



<p>However, Taylor put Indy up with Terrance, who is her target. She went as far as implying Monte was the target at the nomination ceremony to keep everyone guessing what would happen next. </p>

<p>We still have a Veto to play, and we know the house will be split in two later this week, so that should switch up the plans considerably. </p>



<p>Big Brother continues Wednesdays at 9 p.m.</p>
