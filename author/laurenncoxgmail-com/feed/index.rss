<p>Sad but true: Taylor Swift&#8217;s parents are divorced.</p>



<p>Fans know that this happened quietly several years ago. After tying the knot in February 1988, Andrea and Scott Swift were married for 23 years before getting divorced in 2011. </p>



<p>They somehow managed to keep their split under wraps <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/taylor-swift-workout-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while daughter, Taylor Swift</a>, embarked on <em>The Speak Now World Tour </em>that same year. </p>



<p>So, how are Taylor Swift&#8217;s parents today a decade after their divorce? </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-andrea-amp-scott-swift-s-marriage-began">How Andrea &amp; Scott Swift&#8217;s Marriage Began</h2>



<p>Long before they became parents to one of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/06/are-taylor-swifts-legs-really-insured-for-40-million-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this generation&#8217;s biggest singer-songwriters</a>, a couple named Andrea Finlay and Scott Swift got married in Houston, Texas. </p>



<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a60000078/who-are-taylor-swift-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea was a marketing executive</a> while Scott was a financial advisor. </p>



<p>Just before celebrating two years of marriage the couple welcomed their first child, Taylor Allison Swift, on December 13, 1989. A little over two years later they would welcome her brother, Austin Kingsley Swift, on March 11, 1992. </p>



<p>The pair raised Taylor and her brother, Austin, on a Christmas Tree Farm in Reading, Pennsylvania. <br>This inspired her 2019 holiday hit, &#8220;Christmas Tree Farm.&#8221; A music video for the song features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN3rDTAdM2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family videos</a>, including the then happily married Mr. and Mrs. Swift.<br><br>Andrea and Scott later <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Taylor-Swift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the farm when Taylor was 13</a> years old. Their next move? To a suburb just outside of Nashville, Tennessee in hopes of helping Taylor Swift get a record deal, according to <em>Britannica</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andrea-amp-scott-swift-kept-their-divorce-on-the-low">Andrea &amp; Scott Swift Kept Their Divorce On The Low</h2>



<p>When it came time for Taylor Swift&#8217;s parents to divorce, they managed to do so without making any headlines.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/entertainment-celebrity/heres-why-taylor-swifts-parents-kept-their-divorce-a-secret-for-so-many-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea and Scott Swift were divorced in 2011</a>, though an exact date is unknown. The couple were allegedly separated for a period of time leading up to the divorce. Their marriage ultimately ended due to &#8220;difficulties&#8221; in the relationship, as reported by <em>MSN</em>.</p>



<p>Those alleged &#8220;difficulties&#8221; haven&#8217;t been confirmed by anyone in the immediate Swift family. A source close to the family claimed Andrea Swift being <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/07/taylors-secret-pain-her-parents-split/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the road with Taylor on tour</a> strained the relationship.</p>



<p>&#8220;Andrea being on tour with Taylor full-time has really been hard on her relationship with Scott,&#8221; the anonymous source told <em>Radar Online</em> in 2012.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-s-parents-divorce-may-have-inspired-songs">Taylor Swift&#8217;s Parents Divorce May Have Inspired Songs</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Taylor Swift&#8217;s real life is often the inspiration when she&#8217;s writing songs. She&#8217;s also written several songs about her parents, most notably &#8220;Best Day&#8221; for her mom, Andrea Swift, which was featured on 2008&#8217;s &#8220;Fearless&#8221; album.</p>



<p>Fans have speculated that some of Taylor&#8217;s songs are inspired by Andrea and Scott Swift&#8217;s marriage fizzling out. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/30hklk/did_taylors_parents_get_a_divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditors believe the lyrics to &#8220;Mine&#8221;</a> off of 2010&#8217;s &#8220;Speak Now&#8221; could be about Taylor Swift&#8217;s parents divorce. </p>



<p>For example, &#8220;Mine&#8221; includes: &#8220;You say we&#8217;ll never make my parents&#8217; mistakes&#8221; as well as the line, &#8220;You fell in love with a careless man&#8217;s careful daughter.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fans also find<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/18k34yz/who_do_nongaylors_believe_sad_beautiful_tragic_is/"> lyrics for &#8220;Sad Beautiful Tragic&#8221;</a> could easily be about the end of Andrea and Scott&#8217;s marriage. The track is on Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Red&#8221; album, released one year after her parents reportedly divorced. </p>



<p>&#8220;Distance, timing / Breakdown, fighting / Silence, the train runs off its tracks / Kiss me, try to fix it / Could you just try to listen? / Hang up, give up / For the life of us we can&#8217;t get back,&#8221; a heartbroken Taylor Swift sings during the song&#8217;s bridge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-andrea-amp-scott-swift-remain-united-in-support-of-taylor">Andrea &amp; Scott Swift Remain United In Support of Taylor</h2>



<p>After their 23-year marriage ended, Andrea and Scott Swift remained unwavering in <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-forbes-billionaires-list-1235647690/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of their billionaire daughter</a>. Both Andrea and Scott are often seen attending The Eras World Tour together.</p>



<p>In fact, Taylor Swift&#8217;s parents are very much celebrities in their own right to the Swiftie community. </p>



<p>Scott Swift is known to always have <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kereninas___/video/7336942812455243010?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pocketful of Taylor Swift guitar picks</a> he gives out to fans in the crowd. He&#8217;s even been <a href="https://people.com/taylor-swift-dad-scott-swift-seen-handing-out-snacks-at-syndey-eras-tour-8600918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted handing out snacks</a> in the past! </p>



<p>Andrea Swift has become an <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@laura..newton/video/7383456450095353121?lang=en&amp;q=andrea%20swift&amp;t=1721089377103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expert at exchanging friendship bracelets</a> throughout the Eras Tour. She&#8217;s often seen chatting with fans and taking selfies at the VIP tent before shows. </p>



<p>And sometimes, they still like to meet up with fans together! For example, during the summer 2024 leg of the Eras tour, Andrea and Scott were spotted meeting with an older fan who was wearing &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling 82!&#8221; shirt to her London show. The pair were a united pair in celebrating such an <a href="https://x.com/thisisvertrying/status/1825257139734036564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adorable tribute</a> to their daughter! </p>



<p>We would be &#8220;Guilty as Sin&#8221; not to mention that one time Taylor brought her parents to a nightclub! Andrea and Scott <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@taylorswift/video/7334913558733442334?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined Taylor and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce</a>, to celebrate the Kansas City Chief&#8217;s 2024 Superbowl win.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="826" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-826x1024.jpg" alt="Travis Kelce kisses Taylor Swift" class="wp-image-502695" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-826x1024.jpg 826w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-242x300.jpg 242w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-768x952.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-1651x2048.jpg 1651w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-774x960.jpg 774w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-871x1080.jpg 871w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2004233242-968x1200.jpg 968w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Kelce kisses Taylor Swift after defeating the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 during Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taylor-swift-amp-travis-kelce-have-divorce-in-common">Taylor Swift &amp; Travis Kelce Have Divorce In Common</h2>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-video-super-bowl-victory-party-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three things Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce</a> have in common. They are both super famous, they are both really good-looking, and they both have divorced parents.</p>



<p>Donna and Ed Kelce were married almost 25 years before getting divorced. Similar to Andrea and Scott Swift, the Kelce parents have remained good friends since their romance ended. </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re friends to this day. We get along great,&#8221; Donna shared during an appearance on <a href="https://people.com/sports/all-about-travis-jason-kelce-parents-ed-donna-kelce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis and brother Jason Kelce&#8217;s podcast</a>, New Heights. </p>



<p>She added: &#8220;We were like a tag team with you two. We got to do all sorts of fun things. When one of you had to go out of town, the other person would help with the other child. It was perfect.&#8221;</p>



<p>And, in case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/see-taylor-swifts-parents-and-travis-kelces-family-all-together-at-super-bowl-lviii-219634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Swifts and the Kelces have met</a>! They watched the 2024 Superbowl together in support of Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs, who beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22.</p>



<p>Sadly, the Chiefs were not able to repeat that success last season. But since <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/travis-kelce-announces-nfl-retirement-decision-what-does-it-mean-for-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis has no plans to retire</a>, there&#8217;s always next year!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-find-out-who-broke-up-and-who-got-married">Find Out Who Broke Up and Who Got Married</h2>



<p>There can be no question that Love is Blind this season was filled with surprises and shockers. By the time viewers reached the wedding day finale, it was hard to really say who was going to make it to the altar.</p>



<p>Before the finale, it looked like seven couples are ready to give love a shot sight unseen, but after everyone’s getaway to Mexico, the romances started dropping like flies!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexandra Byrd and Tim Godbee, Monica Davis and Stephen Richardson, and Hannah Jiles and Nick Dorka all jumped ship, so to speak, and decided not to get together in the end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That left Marissa George and Ramses Prashad, Taylor Krause and Garrett Josemans, and, Tyler Francis and Ashley Adionser the only couples on the path to saying “I do”.</p>



<p>Two couples made it, one did not. And the one that didn’t SHOCKED fans to their core.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marissa and Ramses, fan favorites from the get-go, decided at the last minute not to get married. While Marissa was happy to stay engaged, Ramses unexpectedly walked away from their relationship all together, leaving her devastated.</p>



<p>“I don’t think you should’ve come to this experience,” she told him. “How could I feel so sure? And you’re not? It sucks, I want you to choose me,” adding of their split, “This is the worst day of my life.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-visiting-a-new-city">Visiting A New City</h2>



<p>One of the other interesting twists of <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/03/love-is-blind-reunion-8-bombshells-from-the-season-6-reunion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Is Blind</a></em> season seven was that the show called the Washington, DC metro area home. And on an election year — yikes! </p>



<p>Creator <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/love-is-blind-season-7-chris-coelen-lawsuits-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Coelen revealed season seven&#8217;s location</a> during an in-depth interview with <em>Vulture</em> MONTHS before the season aired. It was the first time Netflix had allowed so much information about an upcoming season to be divulged!</p>



<p>With the DC area as its background, it was no surprise to watch as politics came up in the pods. As usual, talking about politics didn&#8217;t help secure any romantic connections. In fact, in terms of Marissa and Ramses, it was their political views that was partially to blame for their split. </p>



<p><em>Vulture&#8217;s</em> own Kathryn VanArendonk witnessed a few pod dates get &#8220;derailed&#8221; by the subject, writing: &#8220;A handsome consultant type describes himself as &#8216;a patriot,&#8217; and although he can’t see it, the woman across from him winces.&#8221;</p>



<p>Remember who that was?!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fans-knew-what-they-were-getting-into-and-what-s-coming-next">Fans Knew What They Were Getting Into &#8211; And What&#8217;s Coming Next!  </h2>



<p>While creator Chris Coelen revealed <em>Love Is Blind </em>season seven was being filmed in Washington, DC, it&#8217;s possible another season could also be in the works. </p>



<p>One eagle eyed Redditor shared video of what appears to be another group of <em>Love Is Blind</em> fiancée&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix/comments/1bdiwdr/season_7_spoiler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preparing to film their search</a> for wedding gowns. The group of unidentified people were spotted outside Beloved Bridal in Stillwater, Minnesota — just outside of St. Paul/Minneapolis area. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the reality series, every season features an episode where all of the brides-to-be gather to try on wedding dresses. At the same time, the grooms-to-be are usually doing their suit shopping with their own loved ones. </p>



<p>Hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey usually make an appearance at each location for the special occasion. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahhorsman3/video/7345131517041167662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original video was posted to TikTok</a> where fans debated the location&#8217;s season status in the comments. Many believe that Minnesota will be home to the eighth season of &#8220;Love Is Blind,&#8221; following Washington, DC. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-love-is-blind-s-controversial-cast-members">&#8216;Love Is Blind&#8217;s Controversial Cast Members </h2>



<p>Following the show&#8217;s rise in popularity is a rise in controversy. </p>



<p>The most recent being that a couple of season six &#8220;Love Is Blind&#8221; cast members were not on the show for the right reasons.</p>



<p>Jeramey Lutinski was <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/love-is-blind-season-6-secret-partners-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed to have been engaged</a> just a few weeks prior to entering the &#8220;Love Is Blind&#8221; pods, as reported by Glamour. Not only did he later confirm the broken engagement, Jeramey claimed he told his &#8220;Love Is Blind&#8221; cast mates. </p>



<p>&#8220;Anybody that I was on dates with, my cast mates, and in multiple interviews, this topic was discussed,&#8221; Jeramey <a href="https://ew.com/love-is-blind-season-6-jeramey-confirms-he-was-engaged-before-filming-8599459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained in a video</a> on Instagram. He added that any footage of him explaining his engagement didn&#8217;t make the &#8220;final cut.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Trevor Sova was still in a relationship while filming the show. </p>



<p>Several texts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3rQegWL-Yn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between Trevor and his then-girlfriend</a> were revealed on Reality Ashley&#8217;s Instagram, one of which shows Trevor saying &#8220;no matter what&#8221; he was &#8220;not getting married.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-netflix-sued-by-former-love-is-blind-cast">Netflix Sued By Former &#8216;Love Is Blind&#8217; Cast </h2>



<p>In addition to shady cast members,<em> Love Is Blind</em> has been battling a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/01/love-is-blind-lawsuits-allege-abuse-sexual-assault-on-set-will-netflix-series-come-to-an-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerning lawsuit</a>. </p>

<p>Renee Poche made it out of the pods with her &#8220;match,&#8221; Carter Wall, their tumultuous relationship was completely cut from season five. In the lawsuit, Renee alleged that Carter &#8220;berated&#8221; her, solicited drugs and even physically threatened a camera operator.</p>



<p>Renee also alleged that she was &#8220;utterly terrified&#8221; of Carter and felt that Netflix put her in a &#8220;dangerous situation&#8221; by forcing them to be alone together for long stretches of time. </p>



<p>The lawsuit is ongoing. </p>

<p>Is there any chance we&#8217;ll see &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; season 12?

<p>But, as Justin Bieber once said: never say never. </p>



<p>A new interview with &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; show runner Alex Baskin gives new hope to longtime fans of the hit Bravo reality series.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-s-still-hope-for-more-vanderpump-rules">There&#8217;s Still Hope For More &#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217;</h2>



<p>Fans of &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; might be feeling uncertain about the show&#8217;s future, but show runner Alex Baskin is not. </p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/vanderpump-rules-season-12-status-after-reunion-1235910413/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussing the fourth-wall breaking finale</a> of season 11 with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, the show runner says it would be &#8220;premature&#8221; to call it the end of &#8220;Vanderpump Rules.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You see there is still a lot of fertile ground and developments in their lives,&#8221; the show runner said during the in depth interview, adding, &#8220;Just because we really close the book on Scandoval in a lot of ways, because it was this moment that sort of blew up everything and that extended into the next season, does not mean necessarily that the show is over.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, in short, we have (hopefully) seen the end of the Scandoval drama&#8230; but (also, hopefully) <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/vanderpump-rules-season-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the end of &#8220;Vanderpump Rules.&#8221;</a> For now. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-08-at-6.15.30%E2%80%AFAM-1024x667.png" alt="Cast of Vanderpump Rules" class="wp-image-499463"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">These Vanderpump Rules cast members will always have a place in our heart.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-vanderpump-rules-cast-change">Will The &#8216;Vanderpump Rules&#8217; Cast Change?</h2>



<p>Even though nothing about the future of &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; is 100% confirmed, many fans are speculating that if (or when) the show returns that there will be major changes to the core cast. </p>



<p>Rumors continue to swirl that Scheana Shay and Lala Kent will be joining Peacock&#8217;s up and coming reality series, &#8220;The Valley.&#8221; The show has a unique take on the life of a reality star, particularly when they are forced out of the club and into the land of responsibility — marriage, children, homeownership, etc. </p>



<p>When asked about potentially jumping from one cast to another, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1405298/scheana-shay-addresses-rumors-shes-joining-the-valley-amid-vanderpump-rules-uncertain-future" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scheana Shay told E! News in July</a>, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;The thing is with ‘The Valley,’ these are my actual friends as well. This is my real friend group,&#8221; Scheana Shay added. &#8220;These are more of my parent friends and ‘Vanderpump Rules’ are more of my party friends.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scandoval-lives-on-in-court">Scandoval Lives On In Court </h2>



<p>Even though show runner Alex Baskin thinks &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; saw the end of Scandoval, Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval&#8217;s lawyers might feel differently. </p>



<p>Former &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; star <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/scandoval-vanderpump-rules-tom-sandoval-ariana-madix-rachel-leviss-1235064324/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raquel Leviss filed a lawsuit</a> against both Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval in February 2024. The lawsuit was for &#8220;revenge porn, eavesdropping, invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress,&#8221; according to a report by Rolling Stone.</p>



<p>According to the suit, Raquel Leviss claims that Tom Sandoval recorded video of her in a &#8220;state of undress&#8221; while &#8220;engaged in sex acts.&#8221; She also claims that Ariana Madix shared the video with a handful of &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; co-stars and production crew members. </p>



<p>The lawsuit slams Tom Sandoval, suggesting that Raquel Leviss was victim to his &#8220;predatory and dishonest behavior&#8221; following her break up with another &#8220;VPR&#8221; co-star, James Kennedy.</p>



<p>Both Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval have separately responded to Raquel Leviss&#8217; lawsuit since. Tom even tried to have the &#8220;eavesdropping&#8221; and &#8220;invasion of privacy&#8221; claims dropped from the lawsuit, but was swiftly denied by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Daniel M. Crowley.</p>



<p>In July, Ariana Madix requested she be removed from the lawsuit all together, with her lawyer citing a constitutional right to &#8220;free speech.&#8221; This, too, was quickly denied by Judge Crowley. </p>

<p>Are Karl Urban and Keith Urban related to each other? The Hollywood stars share much more than just a last name. </p>



<p>One glaring difference between the pair? Their careers in tinsel town. </p>



<p>Karl Urban is best known for his <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/08/karl-urban-to-star-wars-thanks-but-no-thanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film and television roles</a> while Keith Urban is an <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/06/nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban-celebrate-their-11th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning country music</a> artist. </p>



<p>But, do the two Urban&#8217;s share any DNA? Let&#8217;s dig in and find out. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-1024x683.jpg" alt=" Keith Urban attends The 2024 Met Gala " class="wp-image-502063" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2151812348.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Keith Urban attends The 2024 Met Gala Celebrating &#8220;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion&#8221; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-karl-amp-keith-share-more-than-the-urban-name">Karl &amp; Keith Share More Than The Urban Name</h2>



<p>Karl, 52, and Keith, 56 also happen to share a homeland: New Zealand&#8217;s north island.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Boys&#8221; star is originally from the country&#8217;s capital, Wellington, located in the southwest region on the bottom tip of the island. Meanwhile Keith is from Whangārei, which is located all the way at the top of the island. </p>



<p>And, while this has nothing to do with being related, both men have two children. Keith, who married Nicole Kidman in 2006, has two daughters with the Aussie actress: Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith, 13.</p>



<p>Karl has two sons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from his marriage to Natalie Wihongi</a>: Hunter, 23, and Indiana, 18. Unfortunately, Karl and Natalie divorced in 2014 after ten years together. </p>



<p>Despite all of these shared traits, Karl and Keith are not actually related in any way. It seems this just might be a series of several coincidences for the pair of &#8220;K&#8221; name celebs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-big-differences-between-karl-amp-keith">Two Big Differences Between Karl &amp; Keith</h2>



<p>Fans of country crooner Keith will know that he&#8217;s better known as an Australian star due to the fact <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Keith-Urban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he moved from NZ</a> when he was just two years old. </p>



<p>Another thing keeping the pair from any possible relation? Keith&#8217;s real last name is spelled differently: Urbahn.</p>



<p>Keith has never spoken about why he changed the spelling of his name, but <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/keith-urban-real-name-closer-think.html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some have speculated</a> it was done to make the pronunciation easier to remember.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-karl-urban-is-an-only-child">Karl Urban Is An Only Child</h2>



<p>Though Keith has a brother, Shane Urban, Karl doesn&#8217;t have any siblings. </p>



<p>Karl&#8217;s parents were German immigrants living in New Zealand where his mother&#8217;s career in a film production rental company helped spark his acting career. He even spoke fondly of attending screenings as a child during an interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was not only enamored with these films, but the culture of the crew and the way they interacted,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/karl-urban-going-great-guns/ZSDWYQVEBY7YPSBR54Z4PRIBVU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the NZ Herald</a> in 2010. &#8220;I was hooked.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thankfully it all worked out as he now has <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881631/fullcredits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">59 credits on his IMDb page</a> as well as being the star of Amazon Prime&#8217;s original series &#8220;The Boys&#8221; which premiered its fourth season on June 13. </p>

<p>If you find yourself wondering who Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend is, or if he&#8217;s single and ready to mingle, we have the answer for you. </p>



<p>First, the bad news: yes, Jack Quaid is taken. </p>



<p>Second, the good news: Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend is his &#8220;<a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2024/06/the-boys-season-4-premiere-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>&#8221; co-star, Claudia Doumit. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend, Claudia Doumit, and their ongoing romantic relationship off-screen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jack-quaid-amp-claudia-doumit-went-public-in-2022">Jack Quaid &amp; Claudia Doumit Went Public In 2022</h2>



<p>Fans first got a glimpse at Jack Quaid&#8217;s girlfriend when &#8220;The Boys&#8221; <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10895333/Jack-Quaid-appears-confirm-relationship-Boys-star-Claudia-Doumit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were photographed holding hands</a> in 2022. The pair were sight-seeing in Claudia Doumit&#8217;s hometown Sydney, Australia while traveling to promote &#8220;The Boys.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jack has been a lead on the Amazon Prime series since it premiered in 2019, while Claudia joined the cast in season two the following year. It&#8217;s unclear exactly when they took <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12905531/Jack-Quaid-PDA-girlfriend-Claudia-Doumit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things from co-workers to couple</a>. </p>



<p>Many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/v8mw55/jack_quaid_hughie_claudia_doumit_victoria_neuman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; speculated online</a> that the two had &#8220;chemistry&#8221; and a &#8220;flirty vibe&#8221; in their scenes together.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Jack <a href="https://people.com/jack-quaid-girlfriend-spend-valentines-day-disney-exclusive-8575581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke openly about his relationship</a> by sharing his plans to spend Valentine&#8217;s Day with Claudia at Disneyland with PEOPLE.</p>



<p>Just one month later they <a href="https://extratv.com/2024/03/10/jack-quaid-and-claudia-doumit-make-red-carpet-debut-at-oscars-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made their red carpet debut</a> at the 2024 Oscars in March. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-boys-gender-swapped-claudia-doumit-s-role">&#8216;The Boys&#8217; Gender Swapped Claudia Doumit&#8217;s Role</h2>



<p>Since &#8220;The Boys&#8221; is based off of a comic series with the same name, fans might be interested to learn that Claudia Doumit&#8217;s role, politician Victoria Neuman, is actually based on a male character. </p>



<p>Instead of Victoria <a href="https://the-boys.fandom.com/wiki/Victor_Neuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the comics have Victor</a> (aka Vick the Veep). He is also a politician but that&#8217;s the only similarity between the characters, as Victor is considered &#8220;simple-minded&#8221; while Victoria is actually much more conniving. </p>



<p>Victor appears to be a short-lived character in the comics who is eventually killed by Homelander, the main antagonist in &#8220;The Boys&#8221; franchise. It remains to be seen if Victoria will suffer the same fate as Victor.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="724" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-1024x724.jpg" alt="Jack Quaid dating history" class="wp-image-502050" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-300x212.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-768x543.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-960x679.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716-1080x764.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1354206716.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jack Quaid attends the GQ Men of the Year Celebration at The West Hollywood EDITION on November 18, 2021 in West Hollywood, California.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-couple-are-on-opposing-sides-in-the-boys">The Couple Are On Opposing Sides In &#8216;The Boys&#8217;</h2>



<p>Even though Jack Quaid and Claudia Doumit are nothing but <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jack-quaid-and-claudia-doumits-relationship-is-going-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-eyes and PDA off-screen</a>, their on-screen personas — Hughie and Victoria, respectively — couldn&#8217;t be more different.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, Claudia&#8217;s Victoria is a politician <a href="https://the-boys.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria_Neuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who is also secretly a &#8220;supe&#8221;</a> (aka a human with superpowers). Though she originally presents as someone attempting to take down the supes and Vought, the entertainment conglomerate creating them, it&#8217;s unclear what her endgame really is. </p>



<p>Meanwhile Jack&#8217;s Hughie is one of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; alongside <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/the-boys-season-4-review-a-blood-soaked-mix-of-politics-and-gore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl Urban&#8217;s diabolical Billy Butcher</a>. They exist as a group solely to take down the supes and Vought and originally see Victoria as an ally until they learn the truth about her.</p>



<p>In the fourth season of &#8220;The Boys,&#8221; Victoria will be seen running for Vice President as a means to get into the White House which would be disastrous for obvious reasons. </p>



<p>When &#8220;The Boys&#8221; returns to Amazon Prime on June 13 we&#8217;ll see if Hughie, Billy and their team of misfit good guys are finally able to dismantle the evil Vought, the supes it created and, of course, their future VP, Victoria. </p>

<p>If you think that Jack Quaid looks familiar it&#8217;s likely due to his star-studded DNA. </p>



<p><em>The Boys</em> star got his break on the big screen in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/11/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-reviews-are-the-odds-in-its-f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2012&#8217;s <em>The Hunger Games,</em></a> but with parents like Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid he was always destined for Hollywood. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the mega stars that are Jack Quaid&#8217;s parents.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240-678x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-501695" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240-199x300.jpg 199w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240-768x1161.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240-635x960.jpg 635w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240-715x1080.jpg 715w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-816240.jpg 794w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid were a Hollywood It couple early on in their careers. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Diane Freed)</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-story-of-meg-ryan-amp-dennis-quaid">The Story of Meg Ryan &amp; Dennis Quaid</h2>



<p>Like any typical Hollywood romance, <a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/tbt-meg-ryan-dennis-quaid-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid met</a> while working, filming 1987&#8217;s <em>Innerspace</em> together. But things didn&#8217;t heat up for the pair until their second film together, 1988&#8217;s <em>D.O.A </em>which is when they began dating, according to InStyle.</p>



<p>The pair married on Valentine&#8217;s Day in 1992 after four years together. On April 24, 1992 they welcomed their son, Jack Quaid, into the world. </p>



<p>But the &#8217;90s fairytale romance would only last the decade. Meg and Dennis divorced in 2001 following salacious rumors the <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> actress had an adulterous affair <a href="https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/meg-ryan-dennis-quaid-russell-crowe-what-happened-relationship-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Australian actor, Russell Crowe</a>. </p>



<p>Meg and Russell met in 2000 while filming <em>Proof of Life</em> and had a blip of a relationship that ended the same year. But, the repercussions had a lasting effect on the actress once known as &#8220;America&#8217;s Sweetheart.&#8221;</p>



<p>The alleged affair became such a tabloid spectacle that many critics believe it <a href="https://ew.com/article/2000/09/28/what-repercussions-will-meg-ryan-russell-crowe-affair-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tanked Meg&#8217;s ability to draw an audience</a>. </p>



<p>Both Meg and Dennis have since confirmed that their romantic connection <a href="https://www.thelist.com/308913/what-really-happened-with-meg-ryan-and-russell-crowe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already fizzled out</a> by the time Meg moved on (albeit briefly) with Russell. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-call-jack-quaid-a-nepo-baby-in-front-of-his-mom">Don&#8217;t Call Jack Quaid A Nepo Baby In Front Of His Mom</h2>



<p>Now that Jack&#8217;s acting career has taken off, thanks in part to his role as Hughie on Amazon Prime&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.tvfanatic.com/2024/06/the-boys-season-4-premiere-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>,&#8221; many have given him the title of &#8220;Nepo Baby.&#8221; The nickname has a negative connotation as it implies that children of celebrities only become &#8220;famous&#8221; or &#8220;successful&#8221; because of who their parents are. </p>



<p>Meg Ryan wholeheartedly disagrees. </p>



<p>“[Jack]&#8217;s more of a natural than I&#8217;ll ever be,” the <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/getting-cozy-with-meg-ryan-cover-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actress and mother told </a><em><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/getting-cozy-with-meg-ryan-cover-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a> </em>in November 2023. “That nepo stuff is so dismissive of his work ethic, his gifts and how sensitive he is to the idea of his privilege.”</p>



<p>However, Jack claims his mom doesn&#8217;t want to watch &#8220;The Boys,&#8221; which premieres its fourth season on June 13.</p>



<p>But why? The way Jack explains it, his actress mom doesn&#8217;t enjoy watching him &#8220;always in peril.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always on the verge of death,&#8221; he claims she told him after watching the hit series first season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jack-quaid-faces-a-civil-war-in-the-boys-season-4">Jack Quaid Faces A Civil War In &#8216;The Boys&#8217; Season 4</h2>



<p>Speaking of &#8220;The Boys,&#8221; the fourth season will see Jack Quaid&#8217;s Hughie back in action in hopes of saving the world from &#8220;supes&#8221; (aka humans with super powers). </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the series, the premise is that &#8220;The Boys&#8221; — Karl Urban&#8217;s Butcher, Laz Alonso&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Milk, Tomer Capone&#8217;s Frenchie and Karen Fukuhara&#8217;s Kimiko — come together to take down Vought. The corporation poses as an international entertainment conglomerate but is actually responsible for the invention and distribution of a drug called Compound V. </p>



<p>The drug is behind the creation of supes all over the world including The Seven, a handful of A-List supes that are basically just a marketing stunt to make Vought look good. In reality, most of The Seven, <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-boys-antony-starr-homelander-supporters-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially their leader Homelander</a> (Antony Starr), are villains hiding in plain sight. </p>



<p>Season four of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; will show us <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-boys-season-3-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happens after Maeve</a> (Dominique McElligot) sacrificed her powers to take down Solider Boy (Jensen Ackles), if undercover supe Victoria Neuman (portrayed by Jack Quaid&#8217;s off-screen girlfriend, Claudia Doumit) will make it into the White House, and the future of Homelander as a &#8220;hero&#8221; after he murdered a protester on live television.</p>



<p>The first episode of &#8220;The Boys&#8221; season four premiered on June 13 on Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>Where is Aaron Carter&#8217;s fiancée, Melanie Martin, today? Many are wondering what happened to the model in the years after Aaron&#8217;s accidental death at 34 years old on November 5, 2022. </p>



<p>Melanie, 32, is now working to become a fashion and beauty influencer by taking over the LOVE apparel brand Aaron started in 2019. If you take a look at her social media, she heavily promotes the brand which is now sold exclusively at <a href="https://aaroncarter.love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aaroncarter.love</a>. </p>



<p>The brand includes beauty products like foundation and a highlighter palette that are branded &#8220;LOVE by Mel,&#8221; while other products like beanies, hoodies and t-shirts have the name &#8220;Carter&#8221; printed on them. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-500704" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-960x641.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1180346048.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jane Carter and Aaron Carter attend WE tv Celebrates the 100th Episode of the &#8220;Marriage Boot Camp&#8221; reality stars franchise and the premiere of &#8220;Marriage Boot Camp Family Edition&#8221; at SkyBar at the Mondrian Los Angeles on October 10, 2019 in West Hollywood, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images for WE tv )</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fans were not happy about Mel taking over the business, even going so far as to <a href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-melanie-martin-from-selling-aaron-s-belongings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start an online petition</a> for Aaron&#8217;s brother, Nick Carter, to take over instead. Unfortunately for them, the petition was unsuccessful and petered out around 135 signatures.</p>



<p>Melanie also has <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/12/15/aaron-carters-fiancee-melanie-martin-regains-custody-of-son-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full custody of her and Aaron&#8217;s son</a>, Prince Lyric Carter, who was born November 22, 2021, just less than a year before his death. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-did-melanie-martin-get-aaron-carter-s-estate">Did Melanie Martin Get Aaron Carter&#8217;s Estate?</h2>



<p>At the time of his death, Aaron had a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/aaron-carter-made-fortune-untimely-173526531.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth of approximately $550k</a> — a far cry from the estimated $200 million he was worth before turning 18, as reported by <em>Yahoo! Finance.</em></p>



<p>Since the young pop star didn&#8217;t have a will, the state of California was in charge of deciding who inherit what was left of his fortune. Aaron&#8217;s twin sister, Angel Carter, rushed to petition the court to choose her as the estate&#8217;s sole beneficiary. </p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, Angel rescinded her petition and shared that she and Aaron&#8217;s fiancée, Melanie, had agreed <a href="https://radaronline.com/p/aaron-carter-estate-500000-sister-angel-fiancee-melanie-martin-steps-down-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a third party be made administrator</a> of the estate. It&#8217;s unclear if either of them have or will receive any sort of financial compensation from the estate at this time. </p>



<p>However, <a href="https://extratv.com/2023/08/17/aaron-carter-s-death-house-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron&#8217;s 7-bedroom, 4-bathroom</a> home in Lancaster, California was sold for $765k just eight months after his death. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-carter-s-relationship-turmoil">Aaron Carter&#8217;s Relationship Turmoil</h2>



<p>While Melanie&#8217;s social media suggests that her and Aaron&#8217;s relationship was picture perfect, the truth is that it was far from it. </p>



<p>The couple went public as a couple in January 2020. In their first six months together <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-carter-girlfriend-melanie-martin-split-after-her-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanie was arrested</a> for alleged domestic violence, they broke up, got back together, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/aaron-carters-on-off-girlfriend-melanie-martin-suffered-miscarriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a miscarriage</a> and got engaged. </p>



<p>In March 2021, Aaron proudly shared a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9336451/Aaron-Carter-fiance-Melanie-Martin-reveal-positive-pregnancy-test-Instagram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive pregnancy test</a> on Instagram — eight months later, Melanie underwent an emergency C-section and delivered the couple&#8217;s first and only child, son Prince. </p>



<p>&#8220;Prince is precious, I love you son,&#8221; Aaron wrote on Instagram when <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1310716/aaron-carter-welcomes-baby-boy-with-fiancee-melanie-martin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing the exciting news</a>. </p>



<p>Less than a week later Aaron announced <a href="https://www.aol.com/aaron-carter-fianc-e-melanie-203900784.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he and Melanie had split</a>, again, this time because he found out she had been communicating with his &#8220;conniving, deceiving family.&#8221; He claimed he felt betrayed because his family had allegedly tried to put him in prison and get a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/11/britney-spears-reacts-to-end-of-conservatorship-best-day-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney Spears-style conservatorship</a> on him. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-s-final-year-with-melanie-martin">Aaron&#8217;s Final Year With Melanie Martin</h2>



<p>When Aaron and Melanie split for the third time in early 2022, things took a more serious turn. </p>



<p>Aaron filed for a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10553571/Aaron-Carter-files-custody-son-amid-restraining-order-petition-against-ex-Melanie-Martin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restraining order against Melanie</a> as well as full custody of their son, Prince, in February 2022. He cited &#8220;emotional distress&#8221; as well as &#8220;shoving&#8221; as his reasons for the protective order. </p>



<p>Melanie fired back with her own restraining order in March 2022, claiming that Aaron was physically abusive and had <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/03/05/aaron-carter-ex-accuses-singer-of-breaking-three-of-her-ribs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly broken three of her ribs</a>, according to a <em>Page Six </em>report.</p>



<p>At the time, Aaron made <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/393001-aaron-carters-ex-melanie-martin-files-for-restraining-order-says-he-broke-her-ribs-report-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several shocking claims</a> against Melanie, including that she was a &#8220;scam artist&#8221; who had allegedly tried to push him over his second story banister. Melanie countered these claims by alleging that Aaron was in need of &#8220;anger management&#8221; and claiming he became violent after taking &#8220;too many&#8221; prescription pills.  </p>



<p>Both Aaron and Melanie <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/aaron-carters-ex-fianc-e-000602831.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost custody of Prince</a> in mid-2022 due to the hostile nature of their relationship, as reported by Yahoo. Custody of Prince was awarded to Melanie&#8217;s mother. </p>



<p>&#8220;Aaron and I did lose custody of Prince. I think that the real downfall was him losing custody and not knowing what was going to happen,&#8221; Melanie shared in &#8220;Aaron Carter: The Little Prince of Pop,&#8221; a documentary on Hulu about Aaron&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Basically, Aaron had a manic episode. We had a heated fight and it was lingering on for a few days,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Melanie will next be seen talking about Aaron and their relationship in the upcoming docu-series &#8220;Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter&#8221; when it premieres on Sunday, May 26 at 9pm est on Investigation Discovery.</p>

<p>Nick Carter&#8217;s family has been riddled with sorrow for over a decade.</p>



<p>It all dates back to the loss of his first sister, Leslie Carter, in 2012. Sadly, the Backstreet Boys singer has lost a total of four out of his seven siblings since then.  </p>



<p>This big family has endured bigger tragedy, with Nick left to deal with the fallout. Because some of his demons with his siblings, especially his brother Aaron, have yet to be laid to rest.</p>



<p>In fact, they&#8217;re all about to be resurrected in earnest in a new documentary. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nick-carter-s-siblings-meet-all-seven">Nick Carter&#8217;s Siblings: Meet All Seven</h2>



<p>Nick, born January 28, 1990, is the oldest of five children born to parents Jane Elizabeth Carter and Robert Gene Carter. His younger siblings were born in the following order: Leslie in 1986, twins Aaron and Angel in 1987, and Bobbie Jean in 1982. </p>



<p>Nick&#8217;s father Robert, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/05/bob-carter-dies-father-of-nick-and-aaron-carter-was-65/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who died on May 16, 2017</a>, also has three other children from different relationships. First up is his oldest, Virginia (Ginger) Marie Carter, born in 1952. Another daughter, Taelyn Dobson, was born in 1996 followed later by son Kaden Brent Carter in 2005. </p>



<p>Lets take a look at the four siblings Nick has lost over the years, including one of his non-famous half-sisters. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leslie-carter-1986-2012">Leslie Carter: 1986 &#8211; 2012</h2>



<p>Leslie Carter died at just 25 years old in 2012 from <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/leslie-carter-aaron-carters-sister-was-depressed-on-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an alleged overdose</a>, as reported by PEOPLE at the time.</p>



<p>The second oldest of the core five Carter siblings was reportedly battling depression and staying at her father&#8217;s house along with her daughter, Alyssa Jane Ashton, who was only 10 months old. </p>



<p>Nick later revealed that his family <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2012/02/leslie-carter-cause-of-death-unknown-nick-and-aaron-mourn-sister/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blamed him for Leslie&#8217;s death</a> during an appearance on &#8220;Dr. Phil.&#8221; The singer claimed that when his father called to tell him about the tragedy, that &#8220;the conversation turned into not about her death and not about the actual passing and what had occurred,&#8221; but instead about &#8220;themselves.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And then I started to get blamed by the rest of the family,&#8221; he explained.</p>



<p>Several years later, Aaron Carter alleged that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/aaron-carter-alleges-late-sister-leslie-sexually-abused-him-will-give-up-guns-amid-feud-with-brother-nick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leslie had sexually abused</a> him while he was underage. Lawyers for Nick immediately slammed the claims as &#8220;fabricated&#8221; and &#8220;completely false.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aaron-carter-1987-2022">Aaron Carter: 1987 &#8211; 2022</h2>



<p>Aaron Carter <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/04/aaron-carter-cause-of-death-revealed-horrible-and-tragic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died at 34 years old</a> inside his Lancaster, California home on November 5, 2022. An autopsy ruled his <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/aaron-carter-cause-manner-of-death-1235391578/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cause of death to be drowning</a>. The coroner revealed Alprazolam (also known as Xanax) and difluoroethane, a compressed gas often found in air spray cleaners, were found in Aaron&#8217;s system. </p>



<p>It was no secret that at the time Nick and Aaron&#8217;s relationship had always been tumultuous at best. The toxic relationship was memorialized forever when the brothers brawled during their short-lived E! reality series, &#8220;House of Carters,&#8221; which was canceled after eight episodes in 2006.</p>



<p> Aaron was also notably absent from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/04/nick-carter-and-lauren-kitt-married/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick&#8217;s wedding to wife Lauren Kitt</a> in 2014, later blaming his absence on &#8220;technical problems.&#8221; </p>



<p>Things escalated between the siblings when Nick and Aaron&#8217;s twin, Angel, filed a restraining order against the &#8220;I Want Candy&#8221; singer in 2019. They claimed Aaron had made &#8220;violent&#8221; threats to Nick&#8217;s pregnant wife, Lauren, though he denied the allegations and instead accused Nick and Angel of trying to &#8220;silence&#8221; him. </p>



<p>&#8220;My sister lied over and over in an effort to take away my 2nd Amendment rights and she did it on behalf of my brother to silence me talking about how he raped and sexually assaulted multiple women,” the troubled singer wrote on a now expired Instagram story, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nick-carters-restraining-order-against-aaron-carter-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported by Us Weekly</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will abide by the judge’s order, but I will not stop speaking on behalf of victims such as Melissa Schuman,&#8221; Aaron added. </p>



<p>Melissa&#8217;s allegations will be the subject of &#8220;Fallen Idols,&#8221; an investigative docu-series following both Nick and Aaron&#8217;s troubled lives. The two-part series will air on Monday, May 27 and Tuesday, May 28, 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ginger-lee-carter-1972-2023">Ginger Lee Carter: 1972 &#8211; 2023</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.freayfuneralhome.com/obituary/ginger-carter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ginger Lee Carter died unexpectedly</a> at 51 years old in her Mayville, New York home on May 29, 2023. Since very little is known about Ginger and her relationship with the rest of the Carter family, her sudden passing did not make headlines the same way Leslie and Aaron&#8217;s did in previous years. </p>



<p>The Carter half-sister&#8217;s cause of death remains unreleased to the public.</p>



<p>Ginger shared late father Robert Gene Carter with Nick, Leslie, Aaron, Angel and Bobbie Jo. Her mother was Pamela Freeman Wolfe who, according to <a href="https://www.legacy.com/funeral-homes/obituaries/name/ginger-carter-obituary?pid=204634145&amp;v=batesville&amp;view=guestbook&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ginger&#8217;s online obituary</a>, is still alive. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bobbie-jean-carter-1982-2023">Bobbie Jean Carter: 1982 &#8211; 2023</h2>



<p>Just one year after losing Aaron, the Carter family suffered another loss when Bobbie Jean, 41 years old, died in December 2023. The cause of death was <a href="https://people.com/bobbie-jean-carter-cause-of-death-accident-combined-effects-of-fentanyl-methamphetamine-8421870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an accidental overdose</a> due to combined effects of methamphetamine and fentanyl, according to the autopsy. </p>



<p>The medical examiner&#8217;s report also revealed that Bobbie Jean was struggling with schizophrenia. </p>



<p>&#8220;It may take a lifetime to fully process the loss my family has endured over the years — most recently, with the sudden passing of our sister Bobbie Jean,&#8221; Nick <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1sOUMhp31T/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a> just days after her death. </p>



<p>Nick added that he was &#8220;completely heartbroken&#8221; and that he knew his beloved sister was &#8220;finally at peace with God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fallen Idols&#8221; will air never-before-seen interviews with the three women, including Nick&#8217;s ex, Melissa Schulman, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/05/nick-carter-sexual-assault-allegation-ashley-repp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawyer Ashley Repp</a>, and former Backstreet Boys fan, Shannon &#8220;Shay&#8221; Ruth.</p>

<p>Where is Amy Winehouse’s husband today? It’s a question many fans are asking following the release of the singer’s biopic, “Back to Black.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/a/pigeons/blake-amy-winehouse-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy and Blake Fielder-Civil first met</a> at a pub in 2005, before getting married on a whim during a trip to Miami, Florida in 2007. Unfortunately, the marriage fizzled out after just two years. Amy and Blake were divorced in 2009. The tumultuous relationship is now a focus in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2015/04/amy-winehouse-documentary-trailer-released-heartbreaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Back to Black,&#8221; the latest biopic</a> about the late singer. </p>



<p>Thirteen years after <a href="https://people.com/amy-winehouse-death-what-to-know-7502029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy&#8217;s tragic fatal </a>alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011, Blake, now 42 and a father of two, has managed to move on. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-fielder-civil-s-post-amy-winehouse-love-life">Blake Fielder-Civil&#8217;s Post-Amy Winehouse Love Life</h2>



<p>Blake met his next partner, Sarah Aspin, while they were in rehab together in late 2009. The pair had a son together, Jack, in May 2011, making Blake a father. They later welcomed a second child, daughter Lola Jade, in April 2013. </p>



<p>Blake and Sarah were <a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/a60717682/amy-winehouse-husband-blake-fielder-civil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly married and divorced</a>, though actual dates have been kept private making it difficult to piece together a timeline of their relationship. </p>



<p>In August 2012, one year after Amy&#8217;s untimely death, Blake was found choking in bed by Sarah, as originally reported by <em>The Guardian.</em> Blake was <a href="https://theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/09/amy-winehouse-ex-husband-coma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put in a medically induced </a>coma after suffering multiple organ failure. </p>



<p>At the time, Sarah alleged that Blake must have ingested an &#8220;illicit&#8221; substance during a night out drinking with friends. </p>



<p>Thankfully, Blake recovered from the terrifying incident and claimed he has been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sober &#8220;for years&#8221;</a> as recently as April 2024.</p>



<p>As for romantic relationships, Amy&#8217;s ex-husband was reported to be <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3345659/amy-winehouses-ex-blake-fielder-civil-engaged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engaged once again</a>, this time to singer Bay Wright in June 2021. It is unclear if the couple are still together or if they ever ended up tying the knot. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blake-fielder-civil-still-fond-of-amy-winehouse">Blake Fielder-Civil Still Fond of Amy Winehouse</h2>



<p>One thing Blake hasn&#8217;t kept from the public is how he feels about his late ex-wife, Amy, and their on-again/off-again relationship. </p>



<p>&#8220;I loved Amy very much and she loved me too,&#8221; he told <em>Good Morning Britain </em>while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holding back tears</a> during a live interview in April 2024. &#8220;If there was anything that could bring her back&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Blake has also admitted that he would always &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNQQ5x0v1_I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carry a burden of guilt</a>&#8221; for allegedly introducing Amy to drugs during their headline-making relationship. </p>



<p>&#8220;For me, personally, I’ve needed to stop carrying that cross on my own,&#8221; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/amy-winehouse-death-blake-fielder-civil-b2411321.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake told host Ben Shephard</a> in September 2023. &#8220;I’ve carried that burden myself for over 10 years.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added, &#8220;I was a twenty-something-year-old drug addict. So I had absolutely no idea how to make myself clean, let alone somebody else who was a big cog in a machine for a record label, and there were vested interests in <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/amy-winehouse-5-quotes-to-remember-her-by/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy carrying on performing</a>.&#8221; </p>



<p>As for having a relationship with any of Amy&#8217;s family, Blake has made it very clear he <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/blake-fielder-civil-directly-addresses-32569516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would like to make amends</a> with them — especially the late singer&#8217;s father, Mitch Winehouse. </p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to be best friends but I wouldn&#8217;t mind having a conversation,&#8221; Blake said in April 2024. It is yet to be seen if Mitch, or any of the Winehouse family, will take her ex-husband up on his offer. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-for-amy-winehouse-s-4-million-estate">The Fight for Amy Winehouse&#8217;s $4 Million Estate </h2>



<p>When Amy died unexpectedly in 2011, she was worth an estimated $4 million. Her sophomore album, also titled &#8220;Back to Black,&#8221; went double platinum in under a year. Unfortunately, at 27 years old, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/1887612/amy-winehouse-fortune-who-inherited-after-singer-died" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy did not have a will</a> set up for her newfound fame and fortune. </p>



<p>Per British law, a person&#8217;s inheritance is distributed among their parents, spouse and children. Amy and Blake&#8217;s divorced two years prior to her death and did not have any children together, which left Amy&#8217;s father, Mitch Winehouse, as the estate&#8217;s sole inheritor. </p>



<p>However, Blake <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amy-winehouse-blake-fielder-civil-lawsuit-estate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a $1.4 million lawsuit</a> against Mitch demanding not only a lump sum payout but also a monthly allowance, according to <em>Fox News</em>. Blake claimed he had a right to the money because he was with Amy for six years, including their marriage from 2007 to 2009, during which her music made her an international celebrity. </p>



<p>The lawsuit was unsuccessful. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amy-winehouse-s-ex-husband-defends-new-biopic">Amy Winehouse&#8217;s Ex-Husband Defends New Biopic</h2>



<p>Blake recently revealed that he has watched &#8220;Back to Black,&#8221; directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. Despite reviews suggesting the film gave a &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; portrayal to Amy&#8217;s ex, Blake disagrees.</p>



<p>In fact, he <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/amy-winehouse-blake-fielder-civil-gmb-back-to-black-b2527611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called the viewing experience</a> &#8220;therapeutic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not in a sense of being let off the hook or whitewashed, as [has] been alluded to,&#8221; Blake told Good Morning Britain, &#8220;just in a sense of it wasn’t all about addiction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jack O&#8217;Connell, the actor who plays Blake on screen, has also spoken out to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/back-black-amy-winehouse-biopic-movie-2024-jack-oconnell-blake-fielder-civil-mitch-winehouse-1900996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defend his portrayal </a>of the former producer. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&nbsp;think it&#8217;s a very easy narrative to spin. Just to point to one baddie and boo him and just f&#8211;king tear him apart publicly,&#8221; the British actor told Newsweek. </p>
