<p>Elon Musk has taken a lot of heat for his business and political decisions (from <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/elon-musk-completes-purchase-of-twitter-immediately-fires-rivals-within-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying Twitter</a> to supporting President Donald Trump to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/01/elon-musk-responds-nazi-salute-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performing a Nazi-like salute</a> at the inauguration), but his love life has also led to much interest.</p>



<p>Before he was cozying up to Trump, Elon was cozying up to alternative singer Grimes. The former couple have three children, and their relationship has had quite a few twists and turns, but they seem to be done for good.</p>



<p>Elon&#8217;s three marriages and other relationships have made headlines. Musk also has a large brood of children, and he&#8217;s been open about why he&#8217;s decided to father many kids.</p>

<p>As the SpaceX CEO continues to stir up controversy as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, get to know more about Elon&#8217;s romantic past here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elon-musk-s-past-marriages">Elon Musk&#8217;s Past Marriages</h2>



<p>Elon&#8217;s relationship with Grimes has been his most publicized, but the X (formerly Twitter) owner has been married three times to two women.</p>



<p>Elon&#8217;s first marriage was to Canadian author Justine Wilson from 2000 until 2008. The pair first met while they were students at  Queen&#8217;s University in Canada, and they briefly dated in college.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1024x683.jpg" alt="SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk speaks during an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania." class="wp-image-518231" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2180560800-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk speaks during an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After graduating and going their separate ways, the couple reunited a few years later, when Elon invited Justine to Silicon Valley. The author detailed their romance in a <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a5380/millionaire-starter-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal essay</a> for <em>Marie Claire </em>in 2010.</p>



<p>Following the death of their first son and Elon&#8217;s intense work schedule, Justine wrote that the marriage began to falter. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was a dream lifestyle, privileged and surreal. But the whirlwind of glitter couldn&#8217;t disguise a growing void at the core,&#8221; she wrote.</p>



<p>Despite &#8220;some anger&#8221; and complicated divorce proceedings, Justine also wrote that she didn&#8217;t &#8220;regret&#8221; the marriage or divorce in that personal essay.</p>

Santiago/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elon&#8217;s second marriage was to actress Talulah Riley. The pair started dating shortly after he filed for divorce from Justine. They married in 2010, but they divorced in 2012.</p>



<p>Despite splitting up after two years of marriage, they worked out their differences and remarried in 2013. Still, Elon filed for divorce for a short time in 2014, but the couple split up for good in 2016.</p>



<p>Even though the marriage didn&#8217;t last, it appears that the <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>actress doesn&#8217;t have many hard feelings about the relationship ending. </p>

<p>&#8220;I loved/love the guy, so I’m incredibly subjective in my opinion, cannot be unbiased and shouldn’t be expected to be either,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/talulah-riley-elon-musk-marriage-twitter-m05nmcmvt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Times </a></em>in 2024. She also recalled that all her weddings were &#8220;lovely.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Elon Musk divorced Tallulah, he briefly dated actress Amber Heard, before linking up with Grimes. Actress Natasha Bassett and attorney Nicole Shanahan are other rumored flings. He denied any link to Nicole.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elon-musk-s-relationship-with-grimes">Elon Musk&#8217;s Relationship With Grimes</h2>



<p>Elon and Grimes&#8217; relationship has had its share of ups and downs. While many people may be familiar with their romance, the pair never actually tied the knot. Despite never marrying the pair share three kids.</p>



<p>Grimes and Elon have had a bit of an on-and-off dynamic for a few years, but it seems like they&#8217;re done for good as of 2025. Still, the &#8220;Oblivion&#8221; singer seemingly tries to maintain a good relationship to co-parent their kids.</p>



<p>Despite the split, Grimes has caught strays for her ex&#8217;s actions. The tech entrepreneur faced backlash for his Nazi-like salute at Trump&#8217;s rally, and fans called on Grimes to speak out.</p>



<p>Grimes spoke about their children in response to fans asking her to denounce him.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I deeply respect your concern- it is unhealthy that people are this upset when I have not even been online yet today and am only just learning about this controversy now. I don&#039;t know what happened and I will not make a rash statement &#8211; I am not a citizen of this country.…</p>&mdash; 𝖦𝗋𝗂𝗆𝖾𝗌 ⏳ (@Grimezsz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1881618420367507941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote>



<p>&#8220;I am not him. I will not make a statement every time he does something,&#8221;  she <a href="https://x.com/Grimezsz/status/1881618420367507941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;To be clear i could go talk s**t and be on a bunch of magazine covers and be a feminist hero and get clout &#8211; but it would serve no purpose. I choose my children&#8217;s wellbeing,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-current-relationship-status">His Current Relationship Status</h2>



<p>While Elon has been in the public eye even more since Trump&#8217;s win in the 2024 election, his romantic partners have been incredibly dubious. </p>



<p>Amidst his confusing relationship with Grimes, people have also speculated that he&#8217;s dating Neuralink executive Shivon Zillis, with whom he shares two kids.</p>



<p>While their relationship status is not confirmed, Shivon did accompany Elon to Trump&#8217;s inauguration in January 2025, according to <em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/elon-musk-relationship-marriage-history-2018037">Newsweek</a>.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elon-musk-s-children">Elon Musk&#8217;s Children</h2>

<p>Throughout his relationships, Elon has fathered 14 children (that we know of) by four different women. He has shown support for the &#8220;pro-natalist&#8221; movement, according to <em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/elon-musks-12-children-why-he-has-so-many-1987776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek</a></em>. The movement encourages people to have large families to prevent population decline.</p>



<p>Elon has also encouraged followers to reproduce rapidly on X. &#8220;Population collapse is coming&#8230; Earth is almost empty of humans,&#8221; he wrote, per <em><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/i-wouldnt-call-it-eugenics-as-such-how-elon-musks-views-might-influence-donald-trumps-policies-13261496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky News</a></em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;Instead of teaching fear of pregnancy we should teach fear of childlessness,&#8221; Elon continued.</p>



<p>The tech entrepreneur&#8217;s father Errol Musk has also supported the movement. &#8220;We are here to continue being here. We should all be worried about declining populations, any country with any industry should be worried,&#8221; he told <em>Sky News.</em></p>

<p>Elon and Justine had six children during their marriage. Their first, son Nevada Alexander Musk, died at 10 weeks old from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2002.</p>



<p>They had twins Griffin and Vivian in 2004 and triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006. In 2022, Vivian came out as transgender and legally changed her name. </p>



<p>After linking up with Grimes, she gave birth to her and Elon&#8217;s first child X Æ A-Xii in May 2020. The pair caught some heat for the difficult-to-pronounce name.

<p>Grimes revealed that she privately gave birth to a daughter Exa Dark Sideræl Musk in December 2021 in a <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair </a></em>profile in March 2022. In 2023, it was revealed that the pair had a third child, another son.</p>



<p>In October 2023, Grimes sued Elon for parental rights, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/grimes-sues-elon-musk-parental-rights-rcna118608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>NBC News</em>. </a></p>



<p>Shortly before Grimes gave birth to their daughter, Elon fathered twins via IVF with Neuralink Director of Operations Shivon Zillis in November 2021.</p>



<p>In February, conservative influencer <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/ashley-st-clair-welcomes-elon-musks-13th-child-says-billionaire-is-a-deadbeat-dad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley St. Clair revealed that she had a child by Musk</a>.</p>

<p>Vivian is very outspoken about her political opinions and opposing her father. </p>



<p>Elon has said that she was &#8220;killed by the woke mind virus,&#8221; per <em><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News</a></em>. Vivian has not held back in calling out her dad.</p>



<p>In addition to firing back at <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/06/megan-fox-responds-to-claims-that-she-forces-her-sons-to-wear-girls-clothes-elon-musk-gets-involved-for-some-reason/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his transphobic comments</a>, she has also claimed that he was mostly absent as a parental figure during her childhood. &#8220;He’s very quick to anger. He is uncaring and narcissistic,&#8221; she told NBC.</p>



<p>As her father has courted controversy with his political opinions, Vivian has routinely called him out on social media. She also revealed that her mom Justine is very supportive of her.</p>

<p>Scarlett Johansson is much more than a Tony-winning and Academy Award-nominated actress. She&#8217;s also a loving mom to two beautiful children. </p>



<p>Scarlett is beloved for her <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2021/07/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-streaming-release-of-black-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance as Black Widow</a> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but she&#8217;s also appeared in many classic films, including&nbsp;Lost in<em> Translation, Her, </em>and <em>Marriage Story</em>.</p>



<p>Scarlett usually keeps her personal life as private as she can, but she has opened up about a few relationships over the years. She&#8217;s been married to <em>Saturday Night Live </em>star Colin Jost since 2020, and she&#8217;s appeared alongside him on the sketch show.</p>

<p></p>



<p>While Scarlett is most known for her movie roles, she&#8217;s stepped into many different roles over the years. She recently co-hosted <em>Today </em>with Jenna Bush beginning January 21, and she made a cameo on Sunday&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/aubrey-plaza-makes-snl-50-cameo-her-first-public-appearance-since-jeff-baenas-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SNL 50 </a></em>special.</p>



<p>Keep on reading to learn more about Scarlett&#8217;s children and whether she&#8217;s expecting another child anytime soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-scarlett-johansson-pregnant">Is Scarlett Johansson Pregnant?</h2>



<p>No, there is no evidence to suggest that Scarlett might be pregnant. The last time that the <em>Black Widow </em>star was expecting a child was in 2021 when she and Colin were expecting their son.</p>

<p>Scarlett did open up about why she was very private about her pregnancy in a 2022 <em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/02/scarlett-johansson-the-outset-clean-skin-care-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> </em>interview. &#8220;I’ve been so protective of both pregnancies, not wanting to feel scrutinized in the public eye,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wanted to be able to have my own feelings about my changing body without other people also telling me how they saw me, whether it was positive or negative,&#8221; she continued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-kids-does-scarlett-johansson-have">How Many Kids Does Scarlett Johansson Have?</h2>



<p>Scarlett has been married thrice, and she has two children. Her first child was a daughter Rose Dorothy. She gave birth to her in 2014. She shares her daughter with her<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/01/scarlett-johansson-and-romain-dauriac-its-over/"> second husband Romain Dauriac.</a></p>

<p>Scarlett and Romain started dating in 2012, and they got married in October 2014. They separated in 2016, and their <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/01/scarlett-johansson-and-romain-dauriac-its-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce was finalized in 2017.</a></p>



<p>That May, Scarlett began <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/05/scarlett-johansson-and-colin-jost-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dating Colin Jost</a>. She <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/05/colin-jost-and-scarlett-johansson-engaged/">tied the knot</a> with the &#8220;Weekend Update&#8221; host in October 2020. The pair welcomed their son Cosmo in August 2021. </p>



<p>In a 2022 interview on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qox0zCiloIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The Kelly Clarkson Show</em></a>, the <em>Marriage Story </em>star noted that both kids share a connection in their names, because they&#8217;re &#8220;both flowers.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;Not a lot of people make that connection. Cosmo is a really sweet little flower that comes in different shades of orange and yellow,&#8221; she said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-was-scarlett-johansson-pregnant-while-filming">Was Scarlett Johansson Pregnant While Filming?</h2>



<p>When Scarlett was expecting her first child, she was in the thick of filming Marvel&#8217;s <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron.</em> When news broke, director Joss Whedon was asked about how they would film around her pregnancy.</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t trim any scenes. We&#8217;re like, &#8216;We&#8217;ll make it work,'&#8221; Joss told <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, via<a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/560686/scarlett-johansson-required-three-stunt-doubles-to-hide-her-pregnancy-curves-in-avengers-age-of-ultron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>E! News.</em></a></p>



<p>With modern special effects, it was very easy to conceal Scarlett&#8217;s pregnancy in the second <em>Avengers </em>film. Three stunt women appeared in action scenes, and they wore face maps to have the actress&#8217;s face added over theirs in post.</p>

<p>Shortly after Scarlett welcomed her son Cosmo, she jetted off to film <em>Asteroid City</em>. She, Colin, and their newborn flew to Spain to work on the project, she revealed in a Sunday Sitdown interview, via <em><a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/scarlett-johansson-postpartum-cosmo-asteroid-city-rcna89657">Today</a>.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I got to bring my infant baby to the table. And he could be held by Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe and Bryan Cranston, and everybody else,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The <em>Lost In Translation </em>star joked that her son would have excellent stories, because &#8220;His earliest babysitters [were] all Academy Award winners.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though Scarlett is an exciting actress to see and work with, she said that Cosmo stole the show on set. &#8220;People were excited to see the baby, not me. They&#8217;re like, &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s you. Where&#8217;s baby?'&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://people.com/scarlett-johansson-says-cosmo-was-asteroid-city-set-baby-exclusive-7547035">People</a></em>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anora-is-her-breakout-role">&#8216;Anora&#8217; Is Her Breakout Role</h2>



<p>In 2024, Mikey became a major star when she portrayed the titular sex worker in <em>Anora</em>. Writer-director Sean Baker had written the part specifically for the actress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-was-a-horseback-rider-before-she-was-an-actress">Mikey Madison Was A Horseback Rider Before She Was an Actress</h2>



<p>Before devoting herself to acting full-time, Mikey had a very intense career path: horseback riding. Her family is made up of dedicated equestrians and cowboys, according to a January 2025 profile in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mikey-madison-anora-lady-in-the-lake-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Cut</em>.</a></p>



<p>While she&#8217;s no longer a competitive horseback rider, the <em>Better Things </em>star has retained an interest in horses. Early in that profile, the writer notes that she was perusing horses available for adoption.</p>



<p>She admitted that it was &#8220;painful&#8221; to give up riding to pursue acting. &#8220;I loved the ritual of getting to the barn and taking care of my horse, but it’s kind of an isolating sport,” she told the outlet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-she-has-a-twin-brother">She Has A Twin Brother</h2>



<p>Mikey has four siblings, including one twin brother. It&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s very close with her twin, and she&#8217;s referenced him in a few interviews.</p>



<p>She mentioned wanting to collaborate with her brother on a few future projects in the above-mentioned <em>Cut </em>interview. &#8220;I have a couple of personal stories that I’d love to work with my twin brother on,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Additionally, she mentioned that she spoke with her brother after finding out about her Oscar nomination in a <em><a href="https://variety.com/lists/oscars-nomination-reactions-ariana-grandes-demi-moore-mikey-madison/mikey-madison-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> </em>interview. &#8220;I was on FaceTime with my mom, my dad, my dog and my twin brother this morning, and I’m humbled; absolutely overjoyed,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s clear that they&#8217;re very close now, Mikey admitted that back when they were growing up there was some distance between her and her twin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My twin brother would pretend that we weren&#8217;t siblings, people would be like on the last day of school &#8216;Miles why would you be getting into [Mikey&#8217;s] car with her?&#8217; and he was like, &#8216;Oh, she&#8217;s my sister,'&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGoTBupUZT8&amp;pp=ygUPdyBtaWtleSBtYWRpc29u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W</a>.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;He has since apologized,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mikey-madison-is-a-proud-dog-amp-cat-mom">Mikey Madison Is a Proud Dog &amp; Cat Mom</h2>



<p>Given her background in horseback riding, it should come as no surprise to learn that Mikey has a soft spot for animals. She gushed about both of her pets in an August 2024 <em><a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61777335/mikey-madison-interview-2024/">Esquire</a> </em>profile.</p>



<p>Her pets have cute names that go hand-in-hand with each other. &#8220;His name is Jam, because I have a cat named Biscuit,&#8221; she told the magazine. Adorable! </p>

<p>Robbie Williams is British pop royalty, and he was hoping to score a worldwide hit with his recent biopic <em>Better Man</em>.</p>



<p>Robbie&#8217;s movie may not have been a box office smash, but steadily drumming up global word of mouth, even from people who have never heard of Take That. While the film is a traditional biopic in that it tells the singer&#8217;s life story, it also comes with one very bizarre caveat.</p>



<p>Instead of an actor playing Robbie (or the man even playing himself), the singer is portrayed as a CGI anthropomorphic chimpanzee, making it seem more like a <em>Planet of the Apes </em>film rather than <em>Walk the Line.</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1442825411-1024x683.jpg" alt='Robbie Williams performs on stage during the "Wetten, dass...?"

<p></p>



<p>Robbie does use his voice in the movie, but the monkey was performed by Jonno Davies, using a motion capture suit. Jonno also does some voice work for the film. </p>



<p>Before you catch Robbie in <em>Better Man</em>, there are plenty of key facts you should know about him going in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robbie-williams-was-a-member-of-the-boy-band-take-that">Robbie Williams Was a Member of the Boy Band Take That</h2>



<p>Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Robbie began his career as a performer in school plays. In 1990, he joined the boy band Take That, when he was 16 years old.</p>



<p>Robbie sang the lead on many of the group&#8217;s early hits, like &#8220;Could It Be Heaven&#8221; and &#8220;I Found Heaven.&#8221; As the group skyrocketed to fame, Robbie&#8217;s drug use created rifts within the band, and he left in 1995. </p>

<p>After leaving the group, Robbie pursued a very successful solo career, but he did rejoin Take That in 2010 for their album <em>Progress.</em> He toured with the band in 2011, and he&#8217;s made multiple appearances at shows over the years.</p>



<p>Despite rejoining the band, Robbie has not performed on any of the three Take That albums that followed 2010&#8217;s <em>Progress</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robbie-williams-has-released-12-solo-albums">Robbie Williams Has Released 12 Solo Albums</h2>



<p>After leaving Take That in the 90s, Robbie kicked off a solo career by covering &#8220;Freedom&#8221; by George Michael. In September 1997, he released his debut solo album <em>Life Thru a Lens</em>. </p>



<p>Since going solo, Robbie has released an impressive 12 albums, with his most recent being 2019&#8217;s <em>The Christmas Present</em>. Many of his records have been certified hits, and he&#8217;s become one of the best-selling artists of all time.</p>

<p>While Robbie may not be a total household name in the United States, he is a genuine star across the globe. In 2006, he broke the Guinness World Record for most tickets sold in a day for his world tour, but that record has since been <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-gave-eras-tour-team-197-million-in-bonuses-ridiculous-generous-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken by Taylor Swift</a>, via<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/taylor-swift-concludes-record-breaking-eras-tour-epic/story?id=116531428#:~:text=Swift's%20record%2Dbreaking%20tour%20grossed,%241%20billion%2C%20according%20to%20Pollstar." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>ABC News</em>.</a></p>



<p>Robbie has been an incredible success in the UK. He is credited with four out of the 60 top-selling albums of all-time in the UK, according to <em><a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-best-selling-albums-of-all-time-on-the-official-uk-chart__15551/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Official Charts.</a></em> That includes both solo albums and Take That records.</p>

<p>In the same way that many singers have mentored younger artists by appearing as judges on <em>American Idol</em> or <em>The Voice</em>, Robbie did so on the famed British <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2007/03/simon-cowell-lays-into-britney-spears-robbie-williams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talent competition <em>The X Factor</em>.</a></p>



<p>In 2018, Robbie was named as one of the judges on the reality show alongside Simon Cowell, One Direction&#8217;s Louis Tomlinson, and his own wife Ayda Field.</p>



<p>This was not the &#8220;Angels&#8221; singer&#8217;s first appearance on <em>The X Factor</em>. He also performed on the program in 2009.</p>

<p>As a teen idol, Robbie&#8217;s personal life certainly drummed up a bit of public interest. &#8217;90s kids, brace yourselves, because he&#8217;s dated two Spice Girls.</p>



<p>He had a brief romance with Melanie Chisholm (&#8220;Sporty Spice&#8221;) in 1997. He had another short romance with Geri Halliwell (&#8220;Ginger Spice&#8221;) in 2000, per <em><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-clarifies-whether-he-actually-slept-with-four-spice-girls-2177579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NME</a></em>. </p>



<p>Robbie has caught some heat for making a joke about getting intimate with some Spice Girls, which he later apologized for in an interview with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5141958/robbie-williams-slept-with-spice-girls-three-four/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Sun</em>.</a> He clarified that it was simply a &#8220;joke.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was on stage and I was about to sing &#8216;Back For Good&#8217; and I said, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I’m very fortunate I’m one of the only people in the world that can say&nbsp;they’ve been in Take That&nbsp;and four out of five of the Spice Girls,'&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Some of the Spice Girls did come forward to let the public know that they did not sleep with him. &#8220;For the record I haven’t. I really haven’t. I said four out of five because it was good for the joke,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Robbie&#8217;s other relationships over the years have also made headlines. In the late 90s, he dated and was even engaged to fellow singer Nicole Appleton.</p>



<p>Robbie <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2010/08/robbie-williams-and-ayda-field-married/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been married</a> to American actress Ayda Field since 2010, and they have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2012/03/robbie-williams-and-ayda-field-expecting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four children together.</a></p>

<p>Robbie&#8217;s CGI chimpanzee biopic may strike some viewers as strange, but the hitmaker does have a penchant for the abnormal.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Rock DJ&#8221; popstar was featured in a documentary where he and filmmaker Jon Ronson ventured to a UFO convention in Nevada, per <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/robbieandjonjourney.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a>.</em> </p>



<p>Robbie has opened up about his interests in the otherworldly and experiences with the paranormal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/19/popandrock.spaceexploration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a>. He also claimed to have had an alien encounter in a 2024 interview on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg07NPV1RWk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loose Women. </a></em></p>



<p>Needless to say, the man&#8217;s life story has the makings of a very interesting biopic!</p>

<p>Shortly after getting hitched, Margaret opened up about her future family plans in a <em><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a45206958/margaret-qualley-interview-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper&#8217;s Bazaar</a> </em>interview, published in September 2023. &#8220;Qualley has always wanted to get married and have kids,&#8221; the profile noted.</p>



<p>In the interview, <em>The Substance </em>star opened up about visiting a friend who recently had a child shortly after she and Jack started dating. She admitted that she snapped photos of herself in a wedding dress, while holding a baby.</p>



<p>Margaret said she sent the producer a photo and wrote, &#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>She confessed that she was excited to have many milestones with the &#8220;Modern Girl&#8221; singer, but she wants to take her time. </p>



<p>&#8220;I just want to do everything with Jack,&#8221; she told the outlet. &#8220;One day I want kids, and I’m not there yet, and I want to keep doing movies. And that’s about all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Margaret connected with the <em>Strange Desire </em>singer, she had a string of relationships with other celebrities.</p>



<p>The actress&#8217;s first public romance was with fellow actor Nat Wolff. They first connected while filming <em>Palo Alto</em>, but they split up by August 2017, according to<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/margaret-qualleys-complete-dating-history-through-the-years-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Us Weekly</em>. </a></p>



<p>Margaret was tied to comedian Pete Davidson back in late 2019. The pair&#8217;s romance came after the funny man <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/pete-davidson-on-ariana-grande-she-dumped-me-because-mac-miller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke off his engagement</a> with Ariana Grande. He also <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2019/02/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-and-kate-beckinsale-are-so-cute-toge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a brief fling</a> with Kate Beckinsale before linking up with Margaret.</p>



<p>It was reported that <em>The Leftovers </em>star and the <em>SNL </em>alum had been dating for a few months in August 2019, per <em><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29020403/pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-relationship-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a></em>. They were spotted together a few times that fall.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s mom actually spilled some details about their love. Andie MacDowell gushed about the young couple in a September 2019 interview with <em><a href="https://people.com/movies/andie-macdowell-margaret-qualley-pete-davidson-beautiful-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>. </p>



<p>&#8220;She has a beautiful relationship with him but I don’t want to step on her relationship too much,&#8221; she told the outlet. Thanks, Mom! Unfortunately, a few weeks later, the pair called it quits.</p>



<p>In 2020, Margaret started dating Shia LeBeouf after appearing in her sister Rainey&#8217;s music video alongside him. In 2021, the pair split up after indie singer FKA Twigs filed a lawsuit for assault and sexual battery against Shia.</p>



<p>Shia has denied the allegations. The actress has shown support for FKA Twigs on social media and in interviews. &#8220;It was important to me for her to know that I believe her. It’s as simple as that,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%252Fculture%252Ffeatures%252Fa37628922%252Fmargaret-qualley-october-2021%252F%26sref%3D%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshia-labeouf-margaret-qualley-fka-twigs-abuse-b1928938.html&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshia-labeouf-margaret-qualley-fka-twigs-abuse-b1928938.html&amp;article_id=1928938&amp;author=Ellie+Harrison&amp;tag=Margaret+Qualley%2CShia+LaBeouf%2CFKA+Twigs%2Candie+macdowell§ion=TV+%26+Radio&amp;category=News&amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;updated_time=2021-09-29T06%3A41%3A49.000Z&amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;ref=www.independent.co.uk&amp;utm_source=independent&amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;gclid=N%2FA&amp;trx-iid=iid1740344487605fjf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper&#8217;s Bazaar </a></em>in 2021. </p>

<p>Bob Dylan is one of the most important figures in all of rock music. And now, over 60 years into his career, he&#8217;s the subject of the new biopic <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>starring Timothée Chalamet. </p>



<p>Timothée&#8217;s performance is already getting buzz, and it seems likely that the movie will be a hit! The James Mangold-directed film is set in the first half of the 60s, chronicling Bob&#8217;s arrival in New York up until his 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance.</p>



<p>The movie is set to hit theaters on Christmas Day 2024, and critics are already starting to praise Timothée&#8217;s portrayal of Bob. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdV-Cs5o8mc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> for the film gave fans a sneak peak in October 2024.</p>

<p>Before going to see Timothée bring Bob&#8217;s early days to the big screen, there are lots of things to know about the <em>Blonde on Blonde </em>singer. Keep reading to learn more about Bob.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-his-real-name-isn-t-bob-dylan">His Real Name Isn&#8217;t Bob Dylan</h2>



<p>It may come as a surprise to some, but Bob Dylan&#8217;s real name is not &#8220;Bob Dylan.&#8221; Bob was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Minnesota in 1941. </p>



<p>As to why Bob chose &#8220;Dylan&#8221; for his surname, the most common legend refers to him borrowing it from the poet <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/dylan-thomas-patti-smith-taylor-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Thomas</a>, who was shouted out on Taylor Swift&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/the-tortured-poets-department-everything-we-know-about-taylor-swifts-album/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>.</a></p>

<p>Despite this being the most common claim, the man himself actually denied those rumors in a 1961 <em>New York Times</em> interview. &#8220;I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas,&#8221; he said, via <em><a href="https://wmgk.com/2018/05/24/bob-went-zimmerman-dylan/">WMGK</a></em>. &#8220;Dylan Thomas’ poetry is for people that aren’t really satisfied in their bed – for people who dig masculine romance.&#8221; </p>



<p>He did explain that he always intended on changing his name in his memoir <em>Chronicles: Volume 1</em>. He didn&#8217;t explain if there was a deeper meaning to choosing &#8220;Dylan&#8221; as his last name.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first time I was asked my name in the Twin Cities, I instinctively and automatically, without thinking, simply said: ‘Bob Dylan,'&#8221; he wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just called myself Robert Allen. As far as I was concerned, that was who I was – that’s what my parents named me. It sounded like the name of a Scottish king, and I liked it. There was little of my identity that wasn’t in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of Bob&#8217;s early hits weren&#8217;t for his own performances. Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221;, &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221;, and &#8220;Mr. Tambourine Man&#8221; were all <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/keith-urban-miley-cyrus-ashtray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered by other musicians</a>.

<p>Bob was a major figure in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Many of his songs were considered protest anthems, and they spoke about the civil rights that people were fighting for. </p>



<p>Songs like &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind&#8221; and &#8220;The Times They Are A-Changing&#8221; both expressed ideas about the civil rights movement and the fight against racism. Bob&#8217;s song &#8220;Only a Pawn in Their Game&#8221; is about the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers.</p>



<p>Perhaps most notably, Bob also performed at the 1963 March on Washington. He and fellow folk singer Joan Baez were both slated performers, per <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-dylan-only-a-pawn-in-their-game-1963-martin-luther-king-1011996/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a></em>. Bob&#8217;s four song set is not as well known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s famous &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech, which he delivered that day.</p>

<p>One of the most famous moments in Bob&#8217;s career, which is also featured in <em>A Complete Unknown, </em>was his 1965 performance at the Newport Folk Festival. </p>



<p>After making a name for himself as a folk musician (and acoustic performer), Bob shocked the crowd at the 1965 festival by performing with an electric guitar. He was met with outrage.</p>



<p>Bob only managed to play three songs, before he was booed off stage. Many folk fans felt that Bob was betraying his fanbase by performing with electric instruments. Some people had clearly thought he&#8217;d sold out.</p>



<p>Despite the controversy, many of the songs with electric instruments have since gone on to be classics. His first electric song &#8220;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#8221; is a beloved classic, and many of the tracks on <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> are regarded as classics, now.</p>

<p>Over the years, Bob has gotten to share the stage with tons of classic artists. Joan Baez was one of the biggest names that he performed with early in his career. Still, there are two bands that Bob is most often grouped with.</p>



<p>Most famously, Bob is associated with The Band. The classic rockers were already an established act, but Dylan recruited them to be his backing band beginning in 1966. Notably, Bob is the one who changed their name to The Band.</p>



<p>When The Band played their farewell concert <em>The Last Waltz </em>in 1976, Bob joined them for a few songs.</p>



<p>In the late 80s and early 90s, Bob was also a member of the Traveling Wilburys. The supergroup also included George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. They put out two albums together.</p>

<p>While plenty of artists slow down on the road as they get older, that&#8217;s not really the case for Bob. In June 1988, Bob set out on the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. Bob has been on the road consistently ever since. </p>



<p>He usually plays about 100 shows per year, and even though his 2021-2024 tour was dubbed the &#8220;Rough and Rowdy Ways&#8221; tour, many still consider it part of the &#8220;Never Ending&#8221; tour. </p>



<p>While many people will likely be interested in catching Bob after seeing <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, it is worth the warning that he does make significant changes to his songs live. Fans often complain about how difficult it can be to tell what songs he&#8217;s performing at recent concerts.</p>

<p>Zoe Saldana is one of the stars of the most-nominated films at the 2025 Academy Awards: <em>Emilia Perez</em>. Her performance has been a standout for the film, and it&#8217;s earned her plenty of recognition from award shows.</p>



<p>In the film, Zoe plays the lawyer Rita Mora Castro. Her performance in the movie has already netted her wins at the 2025 BAFTAs and Golden Globes, and she&#8217;s nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars.</p>



<p>Of course, this is only the latest role in a string of major hits for Zoe. She&#8217;s also starred in the <em>Star Trek </em>and <em>Avatar </em>franchises. She&#8217;s also a member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Gamora in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy.</em></p>

<p>With such a long and exciting career, fans are naturally curious about her romantic history. Get to know more about Zoe&#8217;s marriage and past partners here!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-zoe-saldana-divorced">Is Zoe Saldana  Divorced?</h2>



<p>No, Zoe has never been divorced, but she notably did call off an engagement after <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/07/zoe-saldana-nude-for-womens-health-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a long-term relationship. </a>That being said, the split was many years ago!</p>



<p>One of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>star&#8217;s first public relationships was with fellow actor and businessman Keith Britton. The pair <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2010/07/zoe-saldana-engaged-to-keith-britton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got engaged in 2010, </a>after nearly 10 years together.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, about a year after Keith popped the question, the pair called it quits. A rep for the actress revealed that they &#8220;amicably <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/11/zoe-saldana-and-keith-britton-broken-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separated after 11 years</a>,&#8221; according to <em><a href="https://www.essence.com/news/zoe-saldana-splits-with-fiance-keith-britton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Essence</a>.</em></p>

<p>While things didn&#8217;t work out, Zoe did admit that they did talk about starting a family during an appearance on <em>The Conversation With Amanda de Cadenet</em>.</p>



<p>&#8220;For years he wasn&#8217;t ready. Then when he got ready, I didn&#8217;t have time. I never held anything off because I was waiting for something to kick in. I don&#8217;t think that far about tomorrow,&#8221; she said, per <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/zoe-saldana-i-wanted-kids-with-ex-fiance-keith-britton-2012274/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Us Weekly</em>. </a></p>



<p>She continued, &#8220;I felt the urge to want to have a baby, and I wanted to, but I remember that respecting his decision — and making the decision to wait with him — was one of the most mature things.&#8221;</p>

<p>After splitting from Keith, Zoe did have a short-lived romance with <em>A Star Is Born </em>writer-director Bradley Cooper from 2011 to 2013. The pair filmed <em>The Words </em>during the course of their relationship.</p>



<p>While they played<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/12/bradley-cooper-and-zoe-saldana-totally-dating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> coy about their relationship</a>, Zoe did gush about <em>The Hangover </em>star&#8217;s acting abilities in a 2012 interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/zoe-saldana-bradley-cooper-couple-chemistry-words-premiere-368286/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;Bradley is a very dedicated and open professional,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We didn’t care where was the camera was. It was just like we were both part of this extensive conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though the pair <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/01/bradley-cooper-and-zoe-saldana-its-over-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split up in 2013, </a>it seems that they&#8217;re both still on good terms, as they were both featured in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy.</em> That being said, Bradley was just voicing a character rather than physically appearing in the movie.</p>

<p>Zoe has never been divorced, but she is happily married! Shortly after splitting up with Bradley, the <em>Star Trek Beyond </em>star started dating Italian artist Marco Perego.</p>



<p>The sparks were clearly there, because months after their relationship was revealed, Zoe and Marco <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2013/09/zoe-saldana-and-marco-perego-married/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got married </a>in a private ceremony, per <em><a href="https://people.com/movies/zoe-saldana-marco-perego-relationship-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a></em>.</p>



<p>After getting hitched, the actress hyphenated her last name, and Marco did the same! He also has a tattoo of his wife&#8217;s face. The pair have <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/07/zoe-saldana-expecting-twins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three kids</a> who also share the hyphenated surnames. </p>



<p>A few years after getting married, Zoe opened up about how amazing her relationship with the artist is. &#8220;I was meant for you, and you were meant for me. I’ve always felt comfortable around men as long as they were friends. Now I finally feel comfortable with my lover,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/zoe-saldana-instyle-july-2015-cover-shoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">InStyle</a></em>. </p>



<p>Over a decade after tying the knot, Zoe and Marco are still going strong! He often accompanies her to red carpet events, and she isn&#8217;t shy about speaking about their relationship or <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2014/07/zoe-saldana-pregnant-with-first-child/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family life</a> in interviews.</p>

<p>Adrien Brody is one of the frontrunners for the Best Actor Award at the 2025 Academy Awards. His performance in <em>The Brutalist </em>has been one of the most revered this awards season.

<p>In the years between his last win and now, Adrien has appeared in countless hit films, like <em>King Kong </em>and <em>The Village</em>. He also has been in many Wes Anderson movies, like <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel </em>and <em>Asteroid City.</em></p>

<p>Long before she and Adrien started dating, Georgina was wed to<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/03/harvey-weinstein-sentenced-to-23-years-in-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> now-disgraced producer </a>Harvey Weinstein. They started dating in 2004 and got married in 2007, after he divorced his first wife, Eve Chilton. They share two kids.</p>



<p>After multiple women came forward <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2020/02/harvey-weinstein-found-guilty-of-rape-disgraced-mogul-cuffed-and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusing the producer of sexual misconduct,</a> including rape, assault, and harassment, Georgina announced that she was leaving him. They <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-and-georgina-chapman-its-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separated in 2017</a> and settled the following year. Their divorce was finalized in 2019.</p>



<p>Georgina opened up about her marriage to the sex offender in a 2018 interview with <em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/georgina-chapman-life-after-harvey-weinstein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a></em>. She said that throughout their marriage, she had no suspicions about the abuse that he was conducting behind her back.</p>



<p>In the piece, the journalist reported that she and Harvey were in regular touch due to their divorce proceedings. When asked about what he was thinking as the allegations came out against him, Georgina was frank.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-1024x683.jpg" alt='Adrien Brody and Georgina Chapman attend "The Brutalist" red carpet during the 81st Venice International Film Festival on September 01, 2024 in Venice, Italy.' class="wp-image-520435" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2169729999-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Adrien Brody and Georgina Chapman attend &#8220;The Brutalist&#8221; red carpet during the 81st Venice International Film Festival on September 01, 2024 in Venice, Italy.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Clearly, when I was married to him, I didn’t know anything about his state of mind, so I’m probably not the best person to ask,&#8221; she quipped.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-adrien-brody-meet-georgina-chapman">How Did Adrien Brody Meet Georgina Chapman?</h2>



<p>Romance rumors about Adrien and Georgina first surfaced in 2019. It was reported that the pair met in Puerto Rico for a Helena Christensen swimwear launch, according to<a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/02/25/harvey-weinsteins-ex-wife-georgina-chapman-has-moved-on-with-adrien-brody/"> <em>Page Six. </em></a></p>



<p>Coincidentally, the pair also share a birthday. Adrien was born on April 14, 1973, and Georgina was born the same day in 1976.</p>



<p>Since the initial reports, the couple made their red carpet debut at the 2021 Tribeca Film Fest, and Georgina has accompanied the Oscar-winner to a few more film premieres since then.</p>



<p>Georgina has also posted quite a few date night photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAUmJYZugKL/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>, showing off their stylish outfits.</p>

<p>Besides Georgina, Adrien has had one other major public romance. He dated Spanish actress and model Elsa Pataky from 2006 to 2009. </p>



<p>One of the key moments in their relationship was when Adrien bought the <em>Fast and Furious </em>star a house in New York for her birthday. It was designed to look like a castle, and fans still are swooning over the romantic gesture.</p>



<p>In 2010, she married Chris Hemsworth, and they&#8217;ve been together ever since. </p>



<p>While details about the split are not known, the Elsa and Adrien nearly had an awkward run in at the 2024 Met Gala, according to <em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13389333/Met-Gala-2024-Elsa-Pataky-cross-paths-ex-Adrien-Brody.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DailyMail</a></em>. Adrien arrived at the event as Elsa and Chris were making their way up the red carpet.</p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter has been stuck in all of our heads this year! With tons of hit songs dropping since spring, she&#8217;s been inescapable!</p>

<p>In 2013, Sabrina was cast on <em>Girl Meets World</em> as Maya Hart, the main character Riley&#8217;s BFF.

<p>While Sabrina was also an actress on Disney Channel, she began her music career by recording songs for Disney programs. Her debut EP <em>Can&#8217;t Blame a Girl for Trying </em>was released in 2014 and album <em>Eyes Wide Open </em>in 2015.</p>

<p>In 2020, Sabrina also made her Broadway debut in <em>Mean Girls</em>, but the show closed shortly after because of the COVID pandemic. </p>



<p>While she&#8217;s worked on many projects over the past 10 years, Sabrina&#8217;s big breakout came with her 2022 album <em>Emails I Can&#8217;t Send</em>. The album included the hit &#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; which has become one of her signature songs.</p>



<p>In 2023 and 2024, Sabrina was one of the opening acts on <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/12/taylor-swift-gave-eras-tour-team-197-million-in-bonuses-ridiculous-generous-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift&#8217;s &#8220;Eras Tour.&#8221;</a> Not only did Swifties embrace her, but her beloved (and usually raunchy) &#8220;Nonsense&#8221; outros went viral multiple times.</p>

<p>When the album dropped, it debuted on top of the <em>Billboard </em>200 albums chart, and it&#8217;s no surprise that the tour was also a smash.</p>



<p>Just days after tickets went on sale, the &#8220;Short N&#8217; Sweet&#8221; North American tour was sold out. Official data hasn&#8217;t been released yet, but it reportedly earned $27 million, according to <em><a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/sabrina-carpenter-net-worth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>.</em></p>



<p>While the North American dates are done, Sabrina is set to head out on a European leg of the tour, beginning in March 2025. </p>



<p>Sabrina definitely established herself as a force to be reckoned with on the pop charts in 2024. Fans can only be more excited to see what she has in store for 2025.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that Benny has earned a pretty sweet chunk of change, because he played a major part in plenty of chart-topping songs that any music fan would know.</p>



<p>Most of Benny&#8217;s net worth is estimated from a 2019 catalog sale to Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited. While the exact dollar amount wasn&#8217;t disclosed, comparable deals have been estimated to be between $40 and $50 million.</p>



<p>The other big clue for how his net worth ended up clocking in at $50 million was when he bought a house a few months later. The house Benny purchased was for $9.2 million. It&#8217;s pretty safe to say that the deal was fruitful.</p>



<p>Besides Benny&#8217;s music, he&#8217;s also been pretty active on social media, especially showing off his love for cooking. In 2020, he launched a cooking show with celebrity chef and <em>The Bear </em>star Matty Matheson. </p>

<p>Their series was called <em>Matty and Benny Eat Out America</em>. In 2021, they also began another YouTube series called <em>Stupid F**king Cooking Show</em>.</p>



<p>Benny&#8217;s culinary skills have also drummed up enough interest that in 2024, he released his debut cookbook. He dropped <em>Open Wide: A Cookbook for Friends </em>in April of that year. </p>

<p>Now that Benny and Selena are getting ready to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/selena-gomezs-husband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tie the knot</a>, some people are also wondering how much his net worth compares to his bride&#8217;s. </p>

<p>Even though the all-star producer&#8217;s net worth is certainly nothing to scoff at, it is significantly less than his future wife&#8217;s. That being said, Selena would be tough to catch up to, because she&#8217;s an actual billionaire.</p>



<p>Between music, critically-acclaimed TV shows, and her Rare beauty line, Selena&#8217;s net worth is a whopping $1.3 billion, according to <em><a href="https://parade.com/1251954/jessicasager/selena-gomez-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>.</em> </p>



<p>She&#8217;s in a small group of female musician billionaires alongside Rihanna and her pal Taylor Swift. While their net worths are far apart, Selena and Benny&#8217;s love is clearly very true to each other.</p>
