<p>After being held at gunpoint, bound and thrown in a tub while thieves robbed her of over $10 million worth of jewelry in Paris, Kardashian&nbsp;isn&#8217;t up for a selfie at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not a big plan in place <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/200162_exclusive_kim_kardashian_not_ready_to_return_to_work_has_no_plan_for_big_comeback/">for her comeback</a>,&quot; a source told <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="660" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-1024x660.png" alt="Kim Kardashian on Keeping Up with the Kardashians" class="wp-image-239463" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-1024x660.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-300x193.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-768x495.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-735x474.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-335x216.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-347x224.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-520x335.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-640x413.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-960x619.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kim-kardashian-on-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians.png 1027w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(E!)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;It&#8217;s only been a week. She is still staying off the grid and away from everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Understandably, Kardashian&nbsp;is trying to recover from the incident at her and Kanye West&#8217;s Parisian apartment, where the night concierge was forced by the robbers to open the door to her apartment.</p>
<p>&quot;Kim hasn&#8217;t thought about work just yet,&quot; the source added.</p>
<p>&quot;She is still just relaxing and taking the time to spend it with North and Saint.&quot;</p>
<p>Updates from the robbery reveal that Kardashian&#8217;s diamond cross necklace was found, along with duct tape and zip ties left behind by the suspects.</p>
<p>On The October 11th episode of <em>Ellen</em>, Khloe Kardashian&nbsp;addressed the ordeal, and admitted that her sister&#8217;s current state of mind was worrying.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, it&#8217;s incredibly traumatic what happened to her,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;But our family is super close and great and we&rsquo;ll get through it together and we do appreciate all of your guys&rsquo; love and support,&quot; Khloe told the audience.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take time. You know, it was horrible what happened to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Last night, the Kardashians&nbsp;threw a party after wrapping season 12 of <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em>.</p>
<p>Photobooth pics were shared, but none included Kim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s suspected Kim didn&#8217;t even attend the bash, understandably so.</p>

<p><a href="/2016/10/kim-kardashian-sues-website-insists-i-was-robbed/">Kim recently sued</a> mediatakeout.com for alleging that she was involved in the robbery.</p>
<p>In a complaint filed in New York federal court, Kim&#8217;s lawyer accused the gossip site of alleging that Kim &quot;faked the robbery, lied about the violent assault, and then filed a fraudulent claim with her insurance company to bilk her carrier out of millions of dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyer claims the site is nothing more than &quot;an online gossip tabloid that published a series of articles in early October 2016 referring to her a liar and thief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After having been the victim of a horrific and traumatic armed robbery in France, Kim Kardashian returned to the United States only to again be victimized,&quot; the complaint continued.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s a pretty bold statement for a site to make.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Brace yourselves, because Jax Taylor could be getting his own spin-off.</p>
<p><a href="/categories/vanderpump-rules/"><em>Vanderpump Rules</em></a>&#8216; most intolerable dead-ass and his adorably naive girlfriend, Brittany Cartwright teased what may be plans for their own reality show.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Last week, Cartwright and Taylor shared an Instagram from Bravo&#8217;s offices on the Universal Studios lot.</p>
<p>The couple had attended Bravo&#8217;s bake-off, in which Bravo employees presented their best baked goods to judge Kathy Wakile from <em>The Real Housewives of New Jersey.</em></p>
<p>Taylor hashtagged the photo #jaxandbrittany, and <em>Radar Onlin</em>e reports that he and Cartwright are <a href="http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-filming-vanderpump-rules-spinoff/?utm_source=MediaVine&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TrafficExchange_October">shooting in her native Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not confirmed whether or not the show has been picked up or will even air.</p>
<p>Last season, Taylor introduced the cast and viewers to Cartwright, 27, after meeting her in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Cartwright packed up her life and moved out to Los Angeles to be with Taylor, and tried her best to get hired as a waitress at Sur.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, each time Cartwright came in for an interview, she forgot a resume. &nbsp;She also failed to cover up enough, to the point where even Vanderpump was horrified.</p>
<p>No matter! &nbsp;Jax moved her into his apartment straight away, and bought her a pair of fake boobs.</p>
<p>The new season of Rules teases trouble in paradise, though.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t think things are going well for us anymore,&quot; Taylor tells Cartwright in a preview.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Taylor could be speaking about his relationship with someone else because EDITING, but prior to that, he called out Cartwright for &quot;sitting on the couch for a year while&quot; he takes care of her.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Taylor and Cartwright have been keeping a lid on the status of the relationship, possibly to stir up interest.</p>
<p>Last month, Taylor appealed to the female viewers by partaking in a discussion with co-star Ariana Madix about tampons and birth control.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what&#8217;s f***ed up? You know there is a tax on f***ing tampons?&quot; Madix&nbsp;told her simple friend.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s a tax? But your body automatically&#8230; you don&#8217;t have a choice!&quot; a drunk Taylor replied.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s f***ed up&#8230; they should be free! Just like birth control&#8230; but birth control you can get for free and tampons you have to pay for. That&#8217;s a little weird.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, ladies. &nbsp;Jax Taylor is growing up before our very eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m a total feminist! I&#8217;m starting to believe in women&#8217;s rights.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Season five of Vanderpump Rules premieres Monday, November 7th at 9pm on Bravo.</em></p>

<p>So imagine her surprise when <em>The Real Housewives of New York</em>&#8216;s LuAnn de Lesseps&nbsp;thought the O.C. blond was moving in on her man.</p>
<p>Gunvalson recapped the argument for Andy Cohen on the October 10th episode of <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>.</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>At the time, the Countess was seeing Rey Setter, the high-brown hot mess she ran into at Dorinda Medley and John Mahdessian&#8217;s dry cleaning party.</p>
<p>There, Setter tried to explain to Ramona Singer and Sonja Morgan that he and LuAnn were a thing, but he was a bit overserved so none of it really made any sense.</p>
<p>According to Gunvalson, de Lesseps got territorial with her while they were all out together.</p>
<p>&quot;Luann and I got in a fight that night because she thought that I wanted him,&quot; Gunvalson said.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m like, &lsquo;I don&#8217;t want him, he&#8217;s yours.&#8217; I just met him&hellip;I don&#8217;t know who he is, but she&#8217;s like, &lsquo;Keep your hands off him&#8217;&hellip;he was all over me&hellip;who is he?&#8217;&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="225" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/02/who-me-vicki.gif" alt="Who? Me? Vicki?!" class="wp-image-235231"><figcaption>(Bravo)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those frisky Housewives!</p>
<p>&quot;He was like, &lsquo;I want your number, I think your beautiful,&#8217;&quot; Gunvalson added.</p>
<p>&quot;Luann, you can have him. I&#8217;m good.&quot;</p>
<p>Setter posted a memo to his Instagram account back in May, clarifying that whiel he and de Lesseps did date, they were no longer together.</p>
<p>&quot;I know most of you would like to know, I was seeing Luann for about a year,&quot; Setter explained.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;We met at the NBC after party at NO8 in NYC, we had an instant attraction. Soon after we spent our weekends in the Hamptons, and Europe. Shortly after fall fashion week we mutually decided to go our separate ways.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish her all the best. #nyc #rhony #bravo #rey #tbt&quot;</p>
<p>De Lesseps is set to marry businessman Tom D&#8217;Agostino&nbsp;on New Year&#8217;s Eve in Palm Beach, even though he was caught making out with another woman last season on <em>RHONY</em>.</p>
<p>Gunvalson, meanwhile, is dating <a href="/2016/05/vicki-gunvalson-brags-about-boyfriend-steve-lodge-all-over-insta/">retired cop Steve&nbsp;Lodge</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Simon Saran thinks he&#8217;s pretty funny.</p>
<p>Farrah Abraham&#8217;s on-again/off-again boyfriend has taken to Snapchat after every episode of <em>Teen Mom OG </em>to <a href="/2016/09/simon-saran-slams-teen-mom-og-cast/">make fun of</a> Abraham&#8217;s co-stars.</p>
<p>Saran told <em>Radar Online</em> last month that his roasts are &quot;<a href="http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/farrah-abraham-boyfriend-simon-saran-slams-tmog-costars-feud/?utm_source=MediaVine&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TrafficExchange_October">all in good fun</a>,&quot; but they&#8217;re actually pretty mean, and borderline defamatory (translation: any one of Abraham&#8217;s co-stars could slap him with a lawsuit).</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Saran enjoys making fun of Maci Bookout&nbsp;because she was rumored to be drinking during her third pregnancy.</p>
<p>&quot;Careful kissing mommy, you don&rsquo;t want to get the baby drunk,&rdquo; Saran joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you talk about balance when you can&rsquo;t even balance walking a straight line cause you&rsquo;re too f**ked up,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>And when Bookout washed her baby in the sink, Saran sniped,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wash my baby in the sink, the same sink I spill my beers in.&quot;</p>
<p>Saran saved his best digs for Amber Portwood&#8217;s fiance, Matt Baier.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;He is the red dot in your community, watch out for him,&rdquo; Saran said, insinuating that Baier was a pedophile.</p>
<p>Then, as if speaking to Portwood&#8217;s 7-year-old daughter, Leah, Saran said &ldquo;I would be nervous too sweetheart, you don&rsquo;t want to sit on that man&rsquo;s lap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leah&#8217;s dad, Gary Shirley has &ldquo;every right to be worried about his daughter,&quot; Saran added.</p>
<p>Portwood&nbsp;finally addressed Saran&#8217;s comments via Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he a pedophile?&quot; she asked.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&ldquo;Where does that even come from? STFU and be the little boy toy weak a** person you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t often say this, but I agree with Portwood.</p>
<p>&quot;Simon you&rsquo;re a little b***h who lets a girl talk mad s**t to you. You&rsquo;re weak and irrelevant. You&rsquo;re a little boy toy puppet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BURN!</p>
<p>Today, Saran asked his 9,000+ followers what other shows would be fun to roast.</p>
<p>Fans suggested <em>90 Day Fiance</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Rob &amp; Chyna.</em></p>
<p>&quot;He&#8217;ll get his, don&#8217;t worry,&quot; Portwood later tweeted to Bookout and Catelynn Lowell.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>To which Saran replied, &quot;LMFAO, I&#8217;m shaking&quot; with a bunch of laughing emojis.</p>

</p>
<p>When it was revealed that Caussin <a href="/2016/10/mike-caussin-finally-apologizes-for-cheating-on-jana-kramer/">had cheated on her</a>, Kramer made the decision to leave him.</p>
<p>Now, Kramer is competing for the mirror ball trophy on this season of <a href="/2016/10/dancing-with-the-stars-recap-is-it-dusty-in-here/"><em>Dancing With The Stars</em></a>, and she&#8217;s focused not only on winning, but on herself and her daughter, Jolie.</p>
<p>Last night, the theme was Most Memorable Year, and Kramer decide to select 2016, since Jolie was born on January 31st, 2016.</p>
<p>&quot;This week, it&#8217;s most memorable year, and mine is 2016, because I had my baby girl,&quot; Kramer said on last night&#8217;s episode.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like I&#8217;m the strongest I&#8217;ve been my entire life. She&#8217;s given me the strength I didn&#8217;t know I would have.&quot;</p>
<p>Kramer touched on her first marriage to Michael Gambino, who went to jail for attempted murder.</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#8217;ve been in bad situations where I&#8217;ve let people take that from me.</p>

<p>&quot;Ten years ago, I was in an abusive relationship. It was the worst time of my life. He went to jail for attempted murder on me,&quot; Kramer explained.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s been a very heavy secret to hold for so many years. The situation ten years ago broke me. It took having Jolie to piece together every single broken part of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Kramer told Good Morning America that she still suffers from PTSD.</p>
<p>&quot;I still have that fear when I&rsquo;m alone, him coming to grab me and &hellip; throwing me out of bed.&quot;</p>
<p>Gambino was released in 2010, and two years later he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Kramer and partner Gleb Savchenko danced to Martina McBride&#8217;s &quot;In My Daughter&#8217;s Eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>Kramer even Facetimed&nbsp;McBride herself to share her song selection.</p>
<p>&quot;I never want my daughter to ever go through the things I went through, or question that she&#8217;s not good enough, Kramer said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="605" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-1024x605.png" alt="Jana on DWTS" class="wp-image-243227" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-1024x605.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-300x177.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-768x454.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-735x434.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-335x198.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-347x205.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-520x307.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-640x378.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts-960x567.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/jana-on-dwts.png 1076w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(ABC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;And I want my daughter to know that no man should ever put their hands on her. Because she&#8217;s beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>After her performance, Kramer rushed over to cuddle her daughter, who was in the audience.</p>

<p><em>The Daily Show</em> tweeted a scene from the 2010 scene, in which pro wrestler Maria Kanellis criticized fellow contestant Curtis Stone in front of Trump.</p>

<p>Kanellis was upset that the Australia chef used the ladies room for slightly gross purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason why I said you were so arrogant was because you came in our dressing room and you took a crap and left the stench in the room,&quot; Kanellis told Stone.</p>

<p>Stone didn&#8217;t think it was necessary to bring up the incident, and Trump agreed, calling Kanellis&#8217; use of language &quot;a little below the belt.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump didn&#8217;t like hearing a lady talk about feces, or the use of the word &quot;crap,&quot; and made sure Kanellis knew that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sort of gross, though, bringing that up. It&rsquo;s like disgusting,&quot; he said from across the table.</p>

<p>&quot;This is my boardroom, it&rsquo;s not a locker room, Maria you&rsquo;re fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s weird is that 6 years later, Trump would use that exact same phrase as an excuse for something he said, which was arguably much more crass.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not proud of it. I apologize to my family,&rdquo; Trump has said since the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, in which he shamelessly made lewd comments about O&#8217;Dell&nbsp;and being able to grab a woman <a href="/2016/10/donald-trump-i-moved-on-her-like-a-b-tch-and-grabbed-her-by-the/">&quot;by the p&#8212;-,&quot;</a> was released on October 6th.</p>
<p>&quot;I apologize to the American people. Certainly I&rsquo;m not proud of it. But this is locker-room talk,&quot; Trump said in his half-hearted attempt at an apology.</p>
<p>Billy Bush was also involved in the sexist banter, with neither men knowing that their mics&nbsp;were on.</p>

<p>Bush has since been <a href="/2016/10/billy-bush-suspended-from-the-today-show/">suspended from the <em>Today </em>show</a> indefinitely, issued an apology and deleted his Twitter account.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Dell did issue a statement over the weekend about the tape, and addressed it again on Monday night&#8217;s edition of Entertainment Tonight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a journalist for 26 years now, it is my job to bring you news about others, rather than turning the focus on myself,&quot; O&#8217;Dell began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;But by now, I&rsquo;m sure that most of you have heard the audio tape that, which became national news and part of the presidential race.</p>

<p>&quot;My name was mentioned and unfortunately, the release of it has thrown me in the middle of the political arena of which I didn&rsquo;t ask to be a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What fresh hell will Trump bring between now and election day?</p>

<p>The Oscar winner, 41, is reportedly not doing well after filing for divorce from Brad Pitt after two years of marriage.</p>
<p>Sources described Jolie as &quot;so frail&quot; to <em>Life &amp; Style</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Friends are urging her to eat, and to get help,&quot; &nbsp;one alleged insider claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;But she just <a href="http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/angelina-jolie-frail-divorce-brad-pitt-115666/photos/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-1-190840">isn&#8217;t coping well</a> with the divorce.&quot;</p>
<p>Jolie, who has always been on the thin side, is showing signs of strain &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;At one point, her hands were shaking so uncontrollably that she spilled a glass of water down herself as she attempted to drink it,&quot; the source added</p>
<p>&quot;She became hysterical afterwards and cried nonstop for hours, smoking one cigarette after another.&quot;</p>
<p>Another source told <em>People</em> that Jolie and her six children have started therapy to cope with the split.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Jolie pulled the plug on her and Pitt&#8217;s marriage because they disagreed on how to raise their children. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The final straw came during a fight between the estranged couple aboard a private plane that saw the couple&#8217;s adopted son, Maddox get caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>Maddox was defending his mother, but the altercation was reported to the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services.</p>
<p>While Jolie fights for sole custody of the kids, she&#8217;s kept them away from the public eye in a rental home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t leave the rental house for days,&rdquo; a source told <em>People</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard for all of them. They are used to more activities and more entertainment so it&rsquo;s difficult for them to just stay at the house.</p>

<p>&quot;The younger kids don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Pitt&#8217;s friend, Melissa Etheridge <a href="/2016/10/melissa-etheridge-to-angelina-jolie-you-suck/">slammed Jolie</a> during an appearance on Andy Cohen&#8217;s SiriusXM&nbsp;radio show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It breaks my heart that anyone would take something as personal as your marriage and your relationship and your rights to your children and do it as purposefully as I see it&rsquo;s being done,&rdquo; Etheridge, who has gone through custody battles herself, told Cohen.</p>
<p>Etheridge also revealed that she hasn&#8217;t spoken to Pitt in about ten years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really hope that he reaches back out,&rdquo; the singer said, adding that their relationship ended when he got together with Jolie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of us who haven&rsquo;t seen him in 10 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all lost a friend.&rdquo;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>The concierge who unlocked the door to Kim Kardashian&nbsp;and Kanye West&#8217;s Paris apartment on October 3rd has broken his silence.</p>
<p>In an open letter, obtained by French magazine, <em>Closer</em> the concierge wrote this:</p>
<p><em>Dear Kim, </em></p>
<p><em>when you feel the cold steel of a gun at your neck, it is the moment when remaining calm can mean the difference of life or death, both our lives</em></p>
<p><em>I hope you are feeling better</em></p>
<p>The concierge answered Kardashian with a calm &quot;I don&#8217;t know&quot; when she asked him if they were going to die or not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He believed that his calm demeanor and doing what the robbers said prevented them both from being killed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Now back in Los Angeles, Kardashian is having a hard time coping.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/199767_kim_kardashian_trying_not_to_cry_in_front_of_north_after_paris_robbery/">She is very upset</a> and can&rsquo;t stop thinking about what could have happened,&quot; a source told<em> Entertainment Tonight</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;The scariest part for her throughout this experience is the fact that it could have been a lot worse, and she couldn&#8217;t imagine what that would have been like for her children.</p>
<p>&quot;She is very upset and can&rsquo;t stop thinking about what could have happened. &quot;She still gets emotional thinking about the incident.&quot;</p>
<p>Kardashian&nbsp;is likely suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the source explained how she plays that night over and over in her head.</p>
<p>&quot;All she kept saying over and over is, &#8216;I have kids. Take anything you want. Please don&#8217;t kill me. Please don&#8217;t kill me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t think the flashbacks will go away anytime soon though. It&#8217;s going to take a while for those to stop, as with any traumatic experience like that.&quot;</p>

<p>The ordeal has the entire family upset, not least of all Kanye West.</p>
<p>&quot;Kanye is freaking out &#8212; this really threw him for a loop.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a lot of things that change now <a href="/2016/10/kim-kardashian-desperately-seeking-body-double/">in terms of security</a>, especially with the children.&quot;</p>
<p>One person who is not to blame, according to Kardashian?</p>

<p>Her bodyguard, Pasical Duvier, who was off-duty and at a club with her sister and mom when Kardashian was robbed.</p>
<p>&quot;Kim does not hold Pascal responsible for one second,&quot; the source added</p>
<p>&quot;He was done working for her when this happened.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, Pascal is not an armed bodyguard.&quot;</p>

<p>The country singer caught Caussin cheating on her, and pulled the plug on their marriage in August after saying &quot;I Do&quot; in May 2015.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike was the <a href="http://people.com/tv/exclusive-jana-kramers-current-husband-apologizes-for-behavior-as-she-accuses-him-of-cheating/">biggest of the betrayals</a> because it was the first time in a relationship where I truly loved the version of me,&rdquo; Kramer told<em> People </em>Magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel I had to prove that I was good enough, I was vulnerable and finally at peace with myself.</p>

</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was fooled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kramer said she was &quot;swept away by&quot; the former NFL tight end, and ignored all of the rumors and warning signs until it got to be too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly starting to figure out my worth,&rdquo; Kramer, who was married twice before, admitted to People.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My main problem, which is one reason why I&rsquo;ve been in bad relationships, is that a family is all I want. It&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve dreamed of.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to be loved and I wanted to love someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caussin addressed his infidelity in a recent statement to <em>People</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;I acknowledge that certain actions and behaviors have caused issues in my marriage and I am deeply sorry for the pain I have caused Jana,&rdquo; the statement read.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>They&#8217;ve been pals for awhile, but every now and then a romance rumor pops up that needs addressing.</p>
<p>While promoting her new single from <em>Bridget Jones&#8217;s Baby</em>, &#8220;Still Falling For Your,&#8221; Goulding was asked a rather odd and uncomfortably direct question.</p>
<p>The British singer was giving an interview via satellite to Australian show <em>The Project</em>, when she was asked if she&#8217;s more of a Bridget or an Anastasia (Goulding also sang the theme song to <em>50 Shades of Grey</em>).</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more of a Bridget really&#8230; Ideally neither,&#8221; Goulding answered</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely more of a Bridget, especially in the latest film, she&#8217;s very relatable to me and drinks like a fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The presenter interviewing Goulding then ventured into dangerous territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not having a baby, though? Just to be clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Errrr.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not having a baby anytime soon,&#8221; Guilding responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not having <a href="http://lifestyle.one/heat/celebrity/news/ellie-goulding-forced-deny-pregnant-prince-harry-baby/">a baby with Prince Harry</a> either, yeah?&#8221;  the presenter cheekily asked.</p>
<p>This caused Goulding to turn beet red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t make me go red,&#8221; she said with a laugh.  &#8220;I&#8217;m bright red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever the good sport, Goulding chided the presenter</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did I have a feeling that was going to come up? Naughty people!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some have claimed that at a polo match in June, <a href="/2016/06/prince-harry-and-ellie-goulding-dating/">Goulding and Harry cuddled</a> under a blanket and had a &#8220;snog,&#8221; which sounds like an absolutely blast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry and Ellie only had eyes for each other all night,&#8221; a source told the <em>Daily Mail</em> at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They spent a lot of time sitting together under blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were seen having a kiss before Harry had to go because he was playing polo the next day. Ellie left about five minutes later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another source told <em>Heat</em> that Harry &#8220;has told friends how much he likes Ellie and she is clearly taken by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goulding sang &#8220;Your Song&#8221; at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&#8217;s evening wedding reception, as well as at Harry&#8217;s 30th birthday.</p>
<p>She also performed at the 2014 Invictus Games.</p>
