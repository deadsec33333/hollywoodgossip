<p>Eric Dane has gone public with something very personal and potentially very painful.</p>



<p>The actor has been diagnosed with ALS.</p>



<p>The former Grey&#8217;s Anatomy star, who has been a consistent and successful television presence for many years, confirmed this condition himself via a statement to People Magazine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been diagnosed with ALS,” <a href="https://people.com/eric-dane-diagnosed-with-als-exclusive-11713179">Dane told the outlet</a> late on April 10. “I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter.”</p>



<p>He added:</p>



<p>“I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to set of Euphoria next week. I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.”</p>



<p>The 52-year old is is married to Rebecca Gayheart and the spouses share two children: Billie Beatrice, 15, and Georgia Geraldine, 13.</p>

<p>Dane starred in 139 episodes of Grey&#8217;s Anatomy as Dr. Mark Sloan.</p>



<p>His other major credits include Euphoria, The Last Ship and last year&#8217;s big screen hit, Bad Boys: Ride or Die.</p>



<p>On the beloved HBO drama, Dane plays Cal Jacobs, the strict father to Jacob Elordi’s character Nate Jacobs. He will begin shooting his role for the long-developing third season on April 14.</p>



<p>ALS stands for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It also known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease because the Hall of Fame New York Yankees first baseman passed away from it in 1941.</p>



<p>The prognosis for someone with this rare degenerative disease &#8212; which causes progressive paralysis of the muscles &#8212; is not typically positive.</p>

<p>Those with ALC first experience twitching or weakness in a limb, often followed by slurred speech. </p>



<p>According to the Mayo Clinic, because the disease affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, patients slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk, and breathe independently.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no cure for the disease and the Muscular Dystrophy Association states that patients typically survive only three to five years after diagnosis, although some can live decades.</p>



<p>Sadly, they do not often live in very comfortable circumstances.</p>



<p>In addition to Eric Dane, other notable celebrities who have been diagnosed with ALS include Aaron Lazar, John Driskell Hopkins, Eric Stevens, Joe Bonsall, Roberta Flack, Kenneth Mitchell and Stephen Hawking.</p>



<p><strong>We are sending our thoughts and prayers to Eric Dane and his loved ones.</strong></p>

<p>Garrison Brown would have turned 27 years old on April 10.</p>



<p>We phrase it that way, of course, because the occasional Sister Wives cast member took his own life about 13 months ago&#8230; having died of a self-inflicted gun shot, according to local police in New Mexico.</p>



<p>The tragedy has left mother Janelle Brown reeling.</p>



<p>On Thursday, meanwhile, she took to social media in order to honor her late son on this occasion.</p>

<p>“You seem so alive in the millions of photos I have. I sometimes forget I won’t see you again — and then I remember, Grief is so strange,” the 55-year wrote via Instagram &#8212; alongside a carousel of photos where Garrison is smiling from ear to ear. </p>



<p>“I’ve loved all the remembrances of you posted by family and friends. And I had to re-share the reel from the county fair because it shows who you were so well. Till we meet again sweetheart.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janelle has been forced to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/janelle-brown-mourns-late-son-6-months-after-tragic-suicide/">pen tributes such as these</a> on numerous occasions since she lost Garrison.</p>



<p>The Browns as a whole, for the most understandable reasons possible, have not moved past the young man&#8217;s passing.</p>

<p>For example, Hunter Brown also honored his brother with a heartfelt birthday message about one year after his tragic death at 25.</p>



<p>“Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory,” Hunter wrote on Instagram, referencing a quote from Dr. Seuss. </p>



<p>“Remember to spend the time you have with those you love! Happy Birthday to my Boi! Love you, dude!”</p>



<p>In his post, Hunter added photos from over the years, featuring some of his favorite Garrison memories.</p>

<p>Garrison was one of six children shared by Janelle and her ex-husband, Kody Brown. His siblings include Logan, 30, Madison, 29, Hunter, 27, Gabriel, 23, and Savanah, 20.</p>



<p>In March 2024, The Coconino County Medical Examiner confirmed that Garrison died from a gunshot wound to the head, with his death officially ruled a suicide. </p>



<p>The report also noted ethanol intoxication &#8212; commonly known as alcohol poisoning &#8212; as a contributing factor.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just so, so sad all around.</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/janelle-brown-i-was-stunned-by-my-sons-suicide/">Janelle opened up to People Magazine</a> about Garrison&#8217;s suicide.</p>



<p>“We just had no idea that he was in that place,” Janelle told People of her son&#8217;s mental health last year, adding that “substance abuse” likely played a role in his state of mind prior to his death. “But he didn’t ever express any kind of extreme sad feelings.”</p>



<p>In a text message the night before he died, <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/04/garrison-brown-admits-to-suicidal-tendencies-in-heartbreaking-final-text-messages/">Garrison did admit to suicidal tendencies</a>… which prompted Janelle to ask son Gabe to go check on his brother.</p>



<p>He did so, and discovered Garrison&#8217;s body.</p>



<p>“It just wasn’t for lack of love or lack of anything,” Janelle added months ago of Garrison taking his own life.</p>



<p>“And all I can do is think… we always ask ourselves could we have done something more, but I don’t know. I think that’s a grief trap because I think, ultimately, everybody is responsible for their own actions and their own decisions. But we did everything.</p>



<p>“We really did everything that we could have done. And unfortunately, sometimes [that] still isn’t enough.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>
<p>Lindsay Lohan was recently a guest on Bravo&#8217;s <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>.</p>



<p>The actress reunited at one point with <em>Mean Girls</em> co-star Lacey Chabert and confirmed that she may one day star in an Ann-Margaret biopic.</p>



<p>The response to Lohan&#8217;s appearance, however, focused a lot less on what she said with her mouth &#8230; and a lot more with how she looked.</p>



<p>Especially when it came to her face.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="554" height="435" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/hq720.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513689" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/hq720.jpg 554w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/hq720-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan appears here on Watch What Happens Live.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Bravo)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lohan has been largely out of the spotlight for a number of years.</p>



<p>She has appeared in the occasional music video or narrated the occasional television series over the past few years, but it&#8217;s easy to forget at this point that Lohan was a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/">celebrity gossip</a> mainstay for years back in the early and mid-2000s.</p>



<p>Not always for the most positive of reasons, either.</p>



<p>Now, however, Lohan has a new Netflix movie coming out &#8212; which is why she appeared on <em>Watch What Happens Live</em> and why many people are seeing her for the first time in ages.</p>



<p>And which may explain their confusion over just what&#8217;s in front of them.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="682" height="1024" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-682x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-513692" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2185474611-scaled.jpg 1706w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lindsay Lohan attends the screening of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Our Little Secret&#8221; at The Paris Theatre on November 18, 2024 in New York City. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The natural redhead has been known for her freckled complexion, but take a look at the very first photo within this article.</p>



<p>Take a close look.</p>



<p>Do you see any freckles there, while Lohan sat across from Andy Cohen?</p>



<p>Nope. Neither do we. And we&#8217;re not alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait doesn&#8217;t she have freckles??&#8221; one social media user asked after seeing Lohan on Bravo.</p>



<p>Another said Lohan looks &#8220;great,&#8221; but also noted that she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;look like Lindsay Lohan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Could Lindsay just have been covering up her freckles with some makeup? That&#8217;s what some folks are theorizing.</p>



<p>Either way, though, the consensus out there appears to be that Lohan has come a long way since her more troubled days.</p>



<p>Last year, in an Instagram video that went viral, the actress revealed that she overcame childhood insecurities, including her dislike of her famous freckles.</p>



<p>&#8220;They used to make me uncomfortable as a kid, but now I realize how beautiful they are,&#8221; Lohan said at the time.</p>

<p>Jax Taylor has opened up about something so very personal and painful. Yet also inspiring.</p>



<p>The reality star&#8217;s son has been diagnosed with autism.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for a while,” Taylor told Extra on April 9, referring to ex-Brittany Cartwright and adding: </p>



<p>“Brittany and I have been going back and forth on how we wanted to tell everybody. My little boy is amazing. He’s so beautiful. He’s so delicious. He’s such a smart individual you know, but he’s obviously got some issues with autism.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="798" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-1024x798.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-523121" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-1024x798.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-300x234.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-768x599.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-2048x1596.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-960x748.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-1080x842.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2200879497-1200x935.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jax Taylor attends the LA art show opening night premiere party hosted by Jenna Dewan at Los Angeles Convention Center on February 19, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for LA Art Show)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier that same day, Cartwright announced in an interview with People Magazine that the estranged spouses&#8217; three-year old had been diagnosed six months before.</p>



<p>“I want to be affiliated with autism for the rest of my life,” Taylor said in the wake of this confirmation. </p>



<p>“I want to be in charities. I want to be whatever I can do to spread awareness to help financially, physically, mental. I want to be a part of it all. I feel like this is a sign from somebody that I need to be a part of this world and I want to help out other parents. I want to meet other parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taylor recently admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/jax-taylor-reveals-massive-cocaine-bender-following-brittany-cartwright-divorce/">serious and dangerous cocaine use</a>.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s also said <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/09/jax-taylor-reveals-bipolar-disorder-ptsd-diagnoses-amid-divorce-filing/">he has bipolar disorder</a>.</p>



<p>In this latest case of candor, the Vanderpump Rules alum added: </p>



<p>“When you see other kids … progressing a little bit further than your son and you’re like ‘Why aren’t they understanding?’ It can be a little frustrating, but I know he’ll get there. He’s just taking a little longer.”</p>

<p>Cartwright, 3for her part6, told People that Cruz is mostly nonverbal, yet will “sporadically say different words.” </p>



<p>She said it’s “difficult because I’ve never heard him say, ‘I love you.’ But he is so loving, and he shows me he loves me every single day. He is such a mommy’s boy.”</p>



<p>Continued Brittany on this sensitive topic:</p>



<p>“This is the time he’s building his brain.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m just trying to do everything I possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever. I feel very blessed that I’m able to give him everything that he needs, and that’s why I want to help as many mothers as I can. I have learned so much over the past couple years.”</p>

<p>Taylor, meanwhile, is trying to rebuild his life.</p>

<p>Welp.</p>



<p>Gwyneth Paltrow just went there.</p>



<p>The Oscar-winning actress used her “Call Her Daddy” podcast appearance to spill some VERY personal tea on two VERY famous ex-boyfriends:</p>



<p>Ben Affleck and Brad Pitt.</p>

<p>“They were both good kissers,” the 52-year-old said when the topic turned to these past lovers&#8230; but host Alex Cooper wanted to learn more.</p>



<p>She asked Paltrow “who was better in bed,” and Paltrow actually answered!</p>



<p>Kind of. Sort of.</p>



<p>To at least <em>some</em> extent.</p>

<p> “That is really hard,&#8221; Paltrow responded, prior to delivering the following revealing response: </p>



<p>&#8220;Brad was, like, the sort of major chemistry, love of your life, kind of, at the time. And then Ben was, like, technically excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Interesting, right? Paltrow appears to be saying that Pitt wins in the passion department, but Affleck comes out on top in terms of technique.</p>



<p>&#8221; I can’t believe my daughter is listening to this! … Am I blushing?” Paltrow added on the podcast.</p>

<p>Paltrow and Pitt met on the set of Se7en in 1994 and got engaged in 1996.</p>



<p>After that relationship ended, the star moved on with Affleck, with whom she was romantically linked from 1997 to 2000.</p>



<p>“I’m not sure I would characterize either of them as high maintenance. … I’m not sure [who cared more about their appearance],&#8221; Paltrow also said on Tuesday. </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like neither of them are very vain like that. I’m not attracted to guys who are, like, looking at the mirror the whole time. </p>



<p>&#8220;Although, Ben did have, like, a mirror face that he would throw at the mirror. He had a funny mirror face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paltrow also struggled when asked who was better at his job.</p>



<p>“They’re both so talented. I feel like Ben is a great writer and director, but, I guess, I would probably have to say acting along Brad,” Paltrow responded. </p>



<p>“If you think of all the really different roles he’s done&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ben is great too, they’re both great.”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s getting ugly between Gabby Windey and Clayton Echard.</p>



<p>Or, perhaps we should say, it&#8217;s getting <em>uglier</em> between Gabby Windey and Clayton Echard.</p>



<p>As you may recall, Echard and Windey met, fell for each other and dated on and after the former&#8217;s season of The Bachelor.  </p>



<p>But then Clayton ultimately dumped her — as well as Rachel Recchia — to pursue a relationship with Susie Evans.</p>

<p>This was years ago.</p>



<p>However, Windey took a shot at Echard&#8217;s online dancing videos several days ago&#8230; and her ex did NOT take kindly to it.</p>



<p>“Gabby, what you’re doing is bullying. There’s no other way around it,” Echard said on April 6, addressing Windey, who previously told Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers that Echard’s dancing posts “will make you run … you’ll wish you didn’t have eyes.”</p>



<p>Added Echard in his response to his former lover:</p>



<p>“You’re attacking me for my physical appearance, you’re attacking me for a passion that I love that’s changed my life. It’s unnecessary and it’s not funny.</p>



<p>“You have such a large platform and you’re setting a really bad example, which is just disheartening. I don’t want people to be scared to try something new because [of] bullying online, like what you’re doing. Do better Gabby.”</p>

<p>Take it away now, Gabby!</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s rich,” the 34-year old said via a TikTok video posted on April 8. “It’s rich coming from a man who exploited my sexual life on TV without me knowing.”</p>



<p><em>Yikes</em>, huh? Things are really getting personal now.</p>



<p>Back on Season 26 of The Bachelor, Echard told viewers that he slept with both Gabby and Rachel, an admission most leads had not made in the past.</p>



<p>“You were intimate with ‘the both of us’ you said on national TV in front of millions without having a conversation with me or any other woman first,” Gabby went on Tuesday. “So, you humiliated us in front of each other and in front of everybody watching the TV show.”</p>

<p>Echard previously admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clayton-echard-reveals-suicidal-thoughts-says-susie-evans-saved-me/">having had suicidal thoughts</a> and has shared videos of himself dancing for the camera since 2023.</p>



<p>“[Dancing] has brought so much self love and self confidence that I’m truly so grateful to have found something that I get to work on myself every day and challenge myself,” he said.</p>



<p>“I’m not the greatest at it and I’m aware of that, I’m not delusional but it’s me versus me every single day I get into that studio and it’s movement therapy and it’s allowed me to release a lot of my anger and frustrations.”</p>



<p>Clayton added that he hadn’t talked to Windey — who served as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a> alongside Recchia in 2022 — “in three years,” but that Windey continues “to take shots at me and it’s just unnecessary.”<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehollywoodgossip.com%2F2025%2F04%2Fclayton-echard-trashes-gabby-windey-youre-a-bully-leave-my-dancing-alone%2F&amp;t=Clayton%20Echard%20Trashes%20Gabby%20Windey%20as%20a%20%22BULLY%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/jay-north-cause-of-death-dennis-the-menace-star-passes-away-at-73/"></a></p>

<p>After the the aforementioned 2022 season wrapped up, Clayton garnered backlash over how he behaved. He was ridiculed for exposing his fantasy suite dates with Rachel and Gabby to Susie and claiming he loved them all.</p>



<p>To conclude her latest TikTok video, Gabby took a long pause before directing her comments at Clayton. </p>



<p>“Oh, I’m a mean girl?&#8221; she said. &#8220;As a straight, white man maybe you should do better with your power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meghan Markle has released the first episode of <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markle-podcast-trailer-released-lets-do-this-ladies/">her new podcast</a>, opening up on the platform about something very personal and very painful.</p>



<p>Talking to Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, the Duchess of Sussex revealed that both she and her guest experienced postpartum preeclampsia&#8230; a unique and potentially life-threatening condition marked by high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine shortly after giving birth.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522948" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166226618-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex pose for a photo at Centro Nacional de las Artes Delia Zapata during a visit to Colombia on August 15, 2024 in Bogota, Colombia. <span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by Diego Cuevas/Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We both had very similar experiences — though we didn&#8217;t know each other at the time — with postpartum, and we both had preeclampsia. Postpartum preeclampsia,&#8221; Markle said on air.</p>



<p>The former actress has two kids with Prince Harry: son, Prince Archie, 5; and daughter, Princess Lilibet, 3.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know exactly when the aforementioned condition hit her.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s so rare and so scary,&#8221; Markle continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re still trying to juggle all of these things, and the world doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening quietly. And in the quiet, you&#8217;re still trying to show up for people – mostly for your children — but those things are huge medical scares.&#8221;</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Meghan Markle isn&#8217;t receiving rave reviews for her Netflix series.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Wolfe Herd agreed, saying the condition is &#8220;life or death, truly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Markle talked about the Royal Family tradition of introducing a newborn to the world pretty much immediately; just as Princess Diana and Kate Middleton did previously, Markle stood outside with two-day old Archie back in May 2019.</p>



<p>In front of the media and millions watching around the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could barely face a doorbell delivery for takeout food in a robe,&#8221; Wolfe Herd said, prompting a laugh from Meghan.</p>

<p>Markle is a busy woman these days, hosting this new podcast and also a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/03/meghan-markles-netflix-show-renewed-for-season-2-despite-harsh-criticism/">Netflix show everyone hates</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I do love the most about having young kids, in this chapter while I&#8217;m building [business], is the perspective that it brings because you&#8217;re building something while your child&#8217;s going through potty training…and both are just as important,&#8221; she said on this episode.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like, ‘Great, okay, where&#8217;s the Cheerios? Well done.’</p>



<p>&#8220;And then you&#8217;re championing your team 10 minutes later about something that is really high value for the world. In your own world, that&#8217;s super high value. And in [Lili’s] world, that&#8217;s super high value.&#8221;</p>



<p>Markle has often been accused of acting and sound unrelatable. But plenty of women are likely nodding their heads to this description of how life can be.</p>

<p>Markle and Lemonada Media announced on March 13 that her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, would focus on her entrepreneurial journey launching the As ever lifestyle brand (<a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/meghan-markle-finally-launches-as-ever-entire-inventory-sells-out-immediately/">which sold out its first batch</a> of products last week) and feature honest conversations with fellow female founders over eight installments.</p>



<p>Wrote the polarizing star via Instagram at the time:</p>



<p><em>I’ve been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities, and scaled small ideas into massively successful businesses. They’re opening up, sharing their tips, tricks (and tumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build out my own business, As ever. I</em></p>



<p><em>t has been absolutely eye-opening, inspiring…and fun! (Because what’s the point if we can’t have some fun on this wild adventure?)</em></p>

<p>The White Lotus Season 3 came, saw, felt very slow at times, revealed some shocking deaths&#8230; and then shattered some records.</p>



<p>On Sunday night, the <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-season-3-finale-who-lives-who-dies-what-becomes-of-the-wildly-effed-up-ratliff-clan/">third season finale</a> drew 6.2 million viewers, a 30% jump over the previous series high… which was set at 4.8 million viewers just seven days earlier.</p>



<p>Along with the increase from Episode 7, this finale’s audience represented a 51% increase from the Season 2 finale and a 158% increase from the Season 3 premiere.</p>



<p>The show is a legitimate hit.</p>

<p>In case you weren&#8217;t aware, HBO has already given the green light to Season 4, an announcement that immediately prompted speculation from fans across the globe. </p>



<p>The White Lotus has already taken us to Hawaii. And Italy. And most recently Thailand.</p>



<p>Where might we be headed next?</p>



<p>Those who know creator Mike White well have said there&#8217;s no chance he takes the series anywhere cold; he just doesn&#8217;t like that type of environment.</p>

<p>“For the fourth season, I want to get a little bit out of the crashing waves of rocks vernacular but there’s always more room for more murders at the White Lotus hotels,” <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-white-lotus-mike-white-teases-location-season-4-1236361757/">White said at the end </a>of Season 3 in an interview with Deadline.</p>



<p>This same outlet reported earlier this year that the HBO drama was considering a Four Seasons hotel in Europe for its impending season. </p>



<p>A source added that back then, however, that “everything is on the table for next season” and that no decision has been made.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, HBO Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi has also teased where Season 4 may take place in a chat with Deadline in February.</p>



<p>“We’re going on some locations scouting in the next couple of weeks, so we’ll know soon,” Orsi said. “I can’t really say where we’re going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”</p>

<p>According to Deadline insiders, any scouting trip for the next location has been pushed to summer because White needs a little break after Season 3.</p>



<p>The guy writes every episode. He has certainly earned it.</p>



<p>For those wondering, The Four Seasons chain and HBO formalized their partnership before Season 3 aired, meaning it’s increasingly likely Season 4 will <em>also</em> use a branch of the resort.</p>



<p>The luxury resort’s European locations include London, Paris, Geneva, Budapest, Athens, Madrid and Portugal. Just something to think about it and wonder about.</p>



<p>Early on in Season 3, Executive Producer David Bernad old The New York Post about future episodes: “We haven’t gotten to it yet,&#8221; adding:</p>



<p>“There’s a macro approach, which is ‘what’s a country that has a film community or local crew that also has a tax rebate that’s film friendly?’ We start in a broader sense, and each season has a larger theme.”</p>

<p>Clayton Echard has some very harsh words for his ex-girlfriend.</p>



<p>A few days after Gabby Windey criticized Echard&#8217;s online dancing videos on the April 3 episode of the “Las Culturistas” podcast, Echard via Instagram.</p>



<p>In very personal fashion. </p>

<p>“Gabby, what you’re doing is bullying. There’s no other way around it,” Echard said on April 6, addressing Windey telling Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers that Echard’s dancing posts “will make you run … you’ll wish you didn’t have eyes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Clayton went on as follows:</p>



<p>“You’re attacking me for my physical appearance, you’re attacking me for a passion that I love that’s changed my life. It’s unnecessary and it’s not funny.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have such a large platform and you’re setting a really bad example, which is just disheartening. I don’t want people to be scared to try something new because [of] bullying online, like what you’re doing. Do better Gabby.”</p>

<p>Echard dated Windey on The Bachelor and then ultimately dumped her &#8212; as well as Rachel Recchia &#8212; to pursue a relationship with Susie Evans.</p>



<p>He previously admitted to <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2022/10/clayton-echard-reveals-suicidal-thoughts-says-susie-evans-saved-me/">having had suicidal thoughts</a> and has shared videos of himself dancing for the camera since 2023.</p>



<p>Echard also went <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/09/clayton-echard-served-with-lawsuit-ex-lover-claims-he-impregnated-her-with-twins/">through a paternity scandal</a> that same year, which eventually proved Clayton to be correct.</p>



<p>He <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/10/clayton-echard-celebrates-paternity-test-results-i-told-everyone-i-was-innocent/">did NOT father any kids the woman</a> who accused him of doing so at the time.</p>

<p>While Echard received support from fans who commented on his Instagram response, a handful pointed out that Windey’s podcast remarks may have been taken out of context. </p>



<p>“I really think she was just being cheeky and sarcastic in the podcast,” one person wrote, for example. “I do agree she took it too far, but I don’t think that was her intention.”</p>



<p>But Echard explained in his video that dancing has helped him evolve as a human. He takes it very, very seriously.</p>

<p>“[Dancing] has brought so much self love and self confidence that I’m truly so grateful to have found something that I get to work on myself every day and challenge myself,” he said. </p>



<p>“I’m not the greatest at it and I’m aware of that, I’m not delusional but it’s me versus me every single day I get into that studio and it’s movement therapy and it’s allowed me to release a lot of my anger and frustrations.”</p>



<p>Clayton added that he hadn’t talked to Windey &#8212; who served as <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/categories/the-bachelorette/">The Bachelorette</a> alongside Recchia in 2022 &#8212; “in three years,” but that Windey continues “to take shots at me and it’s just unnecessary.&#8221;</p>



<p>Windey has not yet responded to this takedown.</p>

<p>Barack Obama has opened up about his marriage.</p>



<p>For reasons that don&#8217;t exactly seem concrete or proof of much of anything at all, there&#8217;s been chatter of late that the former President of the United States is headed for a <a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2025/02/barack-obama-divorce-chatter-hits-fever-pitch-source-claims/">divorce from wife Michelle Obama</a>.</p>



<p>During a conversation with Hamilton College President Steven Tepper on April 3, the 63-year old didn&#8217;t tackle this speculation head-on.</p>



<p>But he still made headlines due to his candor.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-522846" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-960x640.jpg 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2166935973-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Obama introduces Barack Obama on the second day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on August 20, 2024.<span class="image-caption-credit"> (Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Admitting to having been “in a deep deficit with my wife” after his two terms in the Oval Office ended, Obama explained further:</p>



<p>&#8220;I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things.</p>



<p>The spouses got married in 1992 and are parents of two daughters: Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23. They&#8217;ve also been honest over the years about the nature of their relationship.</p>



<p>In December 2022, for example, Michelle said there was a decade during their relationship when “she couldn’t stand” her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;People think I&#8217;m being catty by saying this &#8212; it&#8217;s like, there were 10 years where I couldn&#8217;t stand my husband,&#8221; she said in a conversation with Revolt TV. &#8220;And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.&#8221;</p>



<p>Because one of them was a two-term President, the Obamas lived in the White House from January 2009 to January 2017.</p>



<p>In May 2023, when Obama was asked about his wife&#8217;s previous remarks on CBS Mornings, he responded: </p>



<p>“Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her&#8230;</p>



<p>“Michelle — when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four. </p>



<p>:And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasn&#8217;t normal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Michelle didn’t accompany her husband Jimmy Carter’s state funeral … or President Donald Trump’s inauguration; events that a former President’s wife is expected to attend.</p>



<p>Observers have been wondering whether we&#8217;re about to witness the first-ever Presidential divorce, with $70 million at stake between the pair if so.</p>



<p>But the Obamas pay this sort of talk no mind.</p>



<p>“Through it all, what kept us sane — and we tried to instill this in our daughters — is, you cannot live through social media,” Michelle told her brother, Craig Robinson, in a talk at SXSW in March. “I don&#8217;t think I have ever once looked at a comment section, period.”</p>

<p>That sounds like sage advice in our opinion.</p>



<p>On Valentine’s Day 2025, meanwhile, both spouses wrote some very nice things online about the other.</p>



<p>“Thirty-two years together and you still take my breath away. Happy Valentine’s Day, @MichelleObama!” wrote the the two-time Commander-in-Chief on February 14.</p>



<p>Added Michelle on that same date:</p>



<p>“If there’s one person I can always count on, it’s you, @BarackObama. You’re my rock. Always have been. Always will be. Happy Valentine’s Day, honey!”</p>



<p>She even included a heat emoji with this very kind message.</p>
