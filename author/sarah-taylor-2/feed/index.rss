										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Pilot Jones has broken his silence over <a href="/2016/10/blac-chyna-lying-about-paternity-test/">Blac Chyna&#8217;s paternity questions</a>, and as Radar Online <a href="http://radaronline.com/videos/blac-chyna-rob-kardashian-cheating-scandal-pilot-jones-video/">put it</a>, this is the interview that &quot;will <a href="/2016/04/rob-kardashian-congratulates-kylie-jenner-is-their-feud-over/">break Rob Kardashian&#8217;s heart</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if Rob Kardashian needed any more damn sadness in his life.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In the interview, Jones admitted, &quot;I met Blac Chyna a couple years ago, at a party that I was hosting.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two go even further back than ChyRo, it would seem, huh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Rob, he said, &quot;We never really talked about him.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;He never really came up in conversation or anything, so I kind of found out like everyone else [that she was dating Rob].&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>So not only is Chyna shady, she sounds like an opportunist, too &#8211; hopping on the Rob bandwagon and striking while the iron was hot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jones claimed that he assumed that Chyna was in a relationship with Rob when he and Chyna would &quot;go out&quot; and &quot;have fun,&quot; claiming that the two were friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been a really really great friend. We&rsquo;ve hung out. We had a lot of fun together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about the purported makeout pics, he responded, &quot;Who wouldn&#8217;t want to kiss Blac Chyna? She&#8217;s beautiful.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jones continued slyly, &quot;A picture&#8217;s worth a thousand words.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Though Chyna publicly dragged him all over the internet, claiming that he was gross, and that he was gay, and that he, himself, was an opportunist, Jones had nothing but praise for Blac&nbsp;Chyna.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re still friends,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;ll always be my friend.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I just want the best for her,&quot; he smiled, yet reportedly requested a paternity test after he found out that she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friends, hmm.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Friends who reportedly sleep together and then have public feuds over <a href="/2016/05/kris-jenner-forcing-rob-kardashian-to-get-a-paternity-test/">Kardashian paternity testing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That sounds like some great friendship right there, huh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Jones&#8217; allegations went public, Chyna hit the internet in a fury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said, &quot;Ur a dirty ass Punk!!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can never join my roster BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>Ever the class-act, Chyna slammed Jones like there was no tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Which she&#8217;s, you know, pretty good at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In further disturbing baby news, it was reported that <a href="/2016/11/rob-kardashian-and-blac-chyna-televising-birth-of-daughter/">Blac and Rob might be televising the birth</a> of their child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was reported that if the cameras were allowed to roll in the delivery room, ChyRo would make &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just what they&#8217;ll need to fend off homophobic-instigated lawsuits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, <em>everyone</em> wins, really!&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Rumer Willis shared an extremely controversial video featuring her &#8211; but moreso, her lips &#8211; and it&#8217;s got everybody talking. </p>
<p>It&#8217;d appear that Rumer went off the deep end getting lip injections, and these things are large and terrifyingly in charge. </p>
<p>Check it out. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/rumer-willis-latest-plastic-surgery"></a></figure>
<p>Rumer is a beautiful girl, end of. </p>
<p>She might not be &#8220;conventionally&#8221; attractive, and all may not find beauty in her face, but there really is. </p>
<p>Rumer&#8217;s a beautiful blend of both her mother, Demi Moore, and her father, Bruce Willis, and the way that she&#8217;s naturally evolved over the years has been just lovely. </p>
<p>However?  </p>
<p>These lips &#8230; even <a href="/2016/07/kylie-jenner-admits-she-overdid-it-with-lip-fillers/">Kylie Jenner would be ashamed</a> of them. </p>
<p>Previously, Rumer looked like this &#8230; which was very obviously much better. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="719" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-719x1024.jpg" alt="Rumer Willis at Vanity Fair, L'Oreal Paris, &amp; Hailee Steinfeld host DJ Night" class="wp-image-226336" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-719x1024.jpg 719w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-211x300.jpg 211w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-768x1095.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-1078x1536.jpg 1078w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-1437x2048.jpg 1437w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-735x1048.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-235x335.jpg 235w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-243x347.jpg 243w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-365x520.jpg 365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-449x640.jpg 449w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-539x768.jpg 539w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-674x960.jpg 674w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-758x1080.jpg 758w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/rumer-willis-at-vanity-fair-loreal-paris-and-hailee-steinfeld-ho-scaled.jpg 1796w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Even from the profile, you can tell that she&#8217;s got a little bit of lip, but nothing like the dead slugs that are decomposing on her face over the last day. </p>
<p>Previously, <a href="/2016/05/rumer-willis-complains-about-her-jawline-needs-to-shut-up/">Rumer complained about her jawline</a>. </p>
<p>After claiming to have been Photoshopped in a shoot, Rumer said, &#8220;Any friends of fans of mine who posted this I would appreciate if you took it down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The photographer Photoshopped my face to make my jaw smaller and I find it really offensive for anyone to try and change the way you look so drastically,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the way I look and I won&#8217;t support anyone who would feel a need to change the way I look to make me beautiful.&#8221; </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8220;Whether or not they realize it,&#8221; <a href="/2016/05/rumer-willis-complains-about-her-jawline-needs-to-shut-up/">Rumer concluded, &#8220;it is a form of bullying</a>, which I won&#8217;t stand for.&#8221; </p>
<p>Except she&#8217;s not taking her face&#8217;s feelings into consideration, because plastic surgerying your face beyond what&#8217;s recognizable is a definite slap to the face. </p>
<p>Pun totally intended. </p>
<p>The magazine&#8217;s response was even sharper than the cut of Rumer&#8217;s jib. </p>
<p>Another pun totally intended. </p>
<p>&#8220;The retouching that was done to the photograph was only done to resolve some distortion with using a wide angle lens for a group shot, and not to alter or modify anyone’s face,&#8221; the statement from <em>The Cut</em> (lol) read. </p>

<p>Frankly, Rumer needs to chill out and stop being so hypocritical. </p>
<p>She&#8217;s a beautiful girl, and she cries &#8220;bullying&#8221; far too much. </p>
<p>She should just learn to appreciate her gorgeous, unique look and celebrate it, rather than cry &#8220;Photoshop!&#8221; but change it on her own terms.  </p>
<p>Live and let that face alone, girl. </p>

Grow up, girl &#8211; it&#8217;s high time.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re almost 50 years old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put down the ponies and rainbows. Real life is crap sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ET Online</em> <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/201638_exclusive_mariah_carey_traumatized_over_james_packer_split/">reported</a> that Mariah Carey is absolutely &quot;traumatized&quot; by her split from billionaire James Packer, and we&#8217;re apt to believe that it&#8217;s because she just kissed billions of dollars goodbye, because, you know, The Elusive Chanteuse or whoever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The source said, &quot;Mariah is traumatized by all of this but is putting on a brave face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She never meant to fall for James.&quot;</p>
<p>But she did, or at least his high-profile lifestyle, and there you have it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If she never meant to &quot;fall&quot; for him, then she probably shouldn&#8217;t have agreed to married him, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sense and all that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent days, everything from cheating to Scientology has been blamed for the <a href="/2016/10/mariah-carey-and-james-packer-what-happened-in-greece/">Carey/Packer breakup</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A report emerged that claimed <a href="/2016/10/mariah-carey-blames-scientolgy-for-james-packer-split/">Scientology was behind Mariah&#8217;s split</a>, and that one of Packer&#8217;s friends, a high-up in Scientology, was to blame for the couple&#8217;s demise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also revealed that the friend and his Thetan ways &quot;poisoned&quot; the relationship, as Mariah is not a Scientologist, and nobody really knows about the private life of Packer except that he&#8217;s got a gazillion&nbsp;bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did the Scientolofriend&nbsp;&quot;poison&quot; the relationship, you ask?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Packer was said to have brought him in to help him curb excessive spending (surprise, surprise, Elusive Chanteuse), and that it caused a major rift between Carey and Packer.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="970" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-970x1024.jpg" alt="James Packer with Mariah Carey" class="wp-image-245095" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-970x1024.jpg 970w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-284x300.jpg 284w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-768x811.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-1455x1536.jpg 1455w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-1940x2048.jpg 1940w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-735x776.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-317x335.jpg 317w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-329x347.jpg 329w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-493x520.jpg 493w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-606x640.jpg 606w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-727x768.jpg 727w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-909x960.jpg 909w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey-1023x1080.jpg 1023w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/james-packer-with-mariah-carey.jpg 2007w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Getty)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Another rumor was that <a href="/2016/10/mariah-carey-i-didnt-cheat-i-dont-even-have-sex/">Mariah cheated with a backup dancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the report claimed that Mariah would &quot;never cheat,&quot; because she and Packer hadn&#8217;t even physically consummated their relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read? Mariah wouldn&#8217;t put out, so there was no reason or rationale behind cheating on James, and especially with a lowly, likely-low rent backup dancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report stated that Mariah and James &quot;made out plenty,&quot; but that sex, in their 500-day relationship, did not exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough to drive anybody &#8211; save for the Duggars &#8211; mad.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Girl, stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are pretty embarrassing for you right now, and nobody even cares about James Packer &#8230;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230; Because you&#8217;re the Elusive Chanteuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go be elusive somewhere in private for awhile, okay?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drama&#8217;s really starting to wear thin.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Kate Gosselin just can&#8217;t seem to grasp the concept of &#8220;inside voice&#8221; &#8230; whether she&#8217;s inside <em>or</em> out. </p>
<p>In a brand-new trailer for <em>Kate Plus 8</em>, Gosselin flips out &#8211; several times &#8211; on her eight children, and most of them are pretty cringe-worthy moments. </p>
<p>Check out the video and see for yourself &#8230;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/kate-plus-8-trailer-2016"></a></figure>
<p>See, the thing is, <a href="/2016/08/kate-gosselin-on-jon-gosselin-he-totally-changed-on-me/">nobody feels sorry for Kate</a>. </p>
<p>What she&#8217;s done has been done by her own hand, and yeah, while <a href="/2016/10/kate-gosselin-jon-will-steal-my-daughter-and-do-bad-things/">Jon Gosselin is the sketchiest douche</a> and nobody deserves the likes of his treachery, she definitely needs a parenting class, stat. </p>
<p>The above clip, a trailer for the show&#8217;s latest season, is basically a montage of Kate&#8217;s most wretched parenting moments this year. </p>
<p>On several occurrences, she&#8217;s called &#8220;dramatic&#8221; by her children, &#8220;competitive,&#8221; and is said to &#8220;like making a scene.&#8221;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>While we&#8217;d agree with that on all counts, we can also add manipulative, self-serving, attention-seeking, and selfish.  </p>
<p>Is that a pretty comprehensive list, you think?</p>
<p>Girl, yeah. </p>
<p>The new episodes debut in just a few weeks &#8211; November 22nd on TLC, to be specific.</p>
<p>It would appear that the only <strike>earth-shattering</strike> completely unsurprising things that occur are Kate flipping out and yelling a lot.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In the clip, we see the grating reality star freak out over waffles, puppies, stress, doing fun things with her brood of eight.</p>
<p>And pretty much life in general. </p>
<p>The only thing Kate really seems to have a handle on is her hair, which is pretty glorious (and should be, for what she pays for it). </p>
<p>We&#8217;d almost wonder if the show would be in better hands if Jon were featured, too &#8230; which would be a shocker to all involved. </p>
<p>As <a href="/2016/08/jon-gosselin-shocked-upset-by-deadbeat-dad-allegations/">Jon has been branded a deadbeat dad</a>, though, Kate might not be too keen on bringing him on board, even in a guest star capacity.  </p>

<p>TLC, on the other hand, would probably like nothing more than to bring Father Gosselin back into the fray, because, you know, ratings. </p>
<p>Recently, Jon was accused of stalking one of the couple&#8217;s children, and having an &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; relationship with her. </p>
<p>Kate was also said to have claimed that she feared for her life, and that Jon was an imminent threat of danger to her family.</p>
<p>The most incredible part? She didn&#8217;t stop there!</p>
<p>She also called him a drug dealer, and accused him of using his deejaying business to cover up his real profession &#8211; a <em>pusher</em>. </p>
<div class="mvt-featured-post-block"><div class="block-container"><a href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/kate-gosselin-scandals/"><div class="block-header"><div class="block-image"></div><h2 class="block-title">23 Infamous Kate Gosselin Scandals</h2></div></a><div class="block-data"><div class="block-button"><a class="btn" href="https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/kate-gosselin-scandals/"><span>VIEW GALLERY</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="arrow-right" width="32px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 32 12"><g transform="translate(0,12) scale(0.1,-0.1)" fill="#000000" stroke="none"><path d="M240 60 l0 -61 35 27 c19 14 35 30 35 34 0 4 -16 20 -35 34 l-35 27 0 -61z"/><path d="M4 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M84 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/><path d="M164 69 c-10 -17 13 -36 27 -22 12 12 4 33 -11 33 -5 0 -12 -5 -16 -11z"/></g></svg></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>Truth? Lies? Somewhere in the gray area between?</p>
<p>We have absolutely no idea, but this we know:</p>
<p>Whatever Jon Gosselin&#8217;s deal is, at least it&#8217;s not playing out on television for millions of viewers to watch and pull faces over. </p>
<p>Whether he&#8217;s a regular schmoe, a sketchy creep or a felon, Jon&#8217;s at least keeping his business to himself in recent years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot more than we can say for Kate Gosselin, perhaps America&#8217;s craziest mother, second only to the infamous Joan Crawford. </p>
<p>&#8220;No wire hangers!&#8221; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>It&#8217;s safe to say that <a href="/2016/08/derick-dillard-on-el-salvador-people-get-sexually-assaulted-down/">Derick Dillard is no Josh Duggar</a>, but nevertheless, fans are downright <em>worried</em> about the state of Jill Duggar&#8217;s mental health.</p>
<p>Jill Duggar&#8217;s recent behavior also has fans concerned at what the toll their missionary work might be taking on her well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In a new video, Duggar and Dillard recalled a moment that recently occurred where the family was staying in their home.</p>
<p>According to the 25-year-old Jill, she heard a &quot;loud, crashing&quot; noise come from somewhere within the house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two were so terrified, they took their children and hid in their bathroom &#8211; their &quot;safe zone.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the incident, Jill said, &quot;One night, we were getting ready to go to bed, and we heard this loud crashing sound.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Derick&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;You go in the bathroom,&rsquo; which is our safe room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have our laptops, so we were messaging people back home like, &#8216;Pray for us. We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.&#8217; &quot;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/jill-duggar-and-derick-dillards-scary-el-salvador-experience"></a></figure></div>
<p>Jill then broke down, and in an extremely bizarre turn of events, Derick&nbsp;belatedly put his arm around his wife as if to comfort her, but barely touched her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole thing was really, really awkward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turned out not to be an intruder, but a falling shower rack, but Jill&#8217;s nerves were so rattled that she cried &#8211; weeks after the incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As reported, the couple, <a href="/2016/10/jill-duggar-reveals-future-missionary-plans-is-she-leaving-the-c/">Jill and Derick, are back in the states</a> for the time being, but things don&#8217;t seem to be very comfortable at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a producer told the couple, &quot;It&#8217;s good to have you guys here,&quot; Dillard seemed to balk, and looked down at his lap disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s good to be back,&quot; he said. &quot;For awhile.&quot; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Jill&#8217;s younger sister&nbsp;Jessa added, &quot;I know when we&#8217;ve been down there, we hear gunshots all the time.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s really, really intense down there, and I can&#8217;t imagine being home alone with a little one, and hoping that your husband makes it back every night.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even then, Derick pushed forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#8217;re willing to take that risk,&quot; he shot back, &quot;because of what&#8217;s at stake.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;We want to help these people, so there&#8217;s a fine you&#8217;ve got to walk because you want to help, but you don&#8217;t want to isolate yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So if you just live in isolation the whole time, what&#8217;s the point of being there?&quot; he reasoned. &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="582" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-1024x582.png" alt="Derick Dillard Braces Pic" class="wp-image-238963" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-1024x582.png 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-300x170.png 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-768x436.png 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-1536x873.png 1536w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-2048x1164.png 2048w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-735x418.png 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-335x190.png 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-347x197.png 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-520x295.png 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-640x364.png 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-960x545.png 960w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/derick-dillard-braces-pic-1080x614.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(TLC)</figcaption></figure>

<p>His demeanor and disposition positively screamed &quot;Back off,&quot; so the sisters &#8211; and Jill &#8211; held their tongues after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="/2016/10/jill-duggar-responds-to-rumors-about-derick-dillards-health/">Dillard was under fire</a> for looking extremely unhealthy and malnourished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fans wrote on Duggar&#8217;s social media pages:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derick looks very sick, and undernourished. Looks like his hair is falling out as a result as well.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Duggar brushed off the comments, and chalked it up to having better food choices in the third world country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We think that Dillard is a little more than malnourished &#8211; and we think he might be a little off in the noggin as well.</p>
<p>Being so headstrong in forcing his meek wife and toddler to not only remain in a dangerous place for a dangerous duration of time?</p>
<p>It makes you wonder &#8230; and it looks like the couple is set to return to El Salvador soon to resume Dillard&#8217;s missionary work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jill already sadly made mention that their current stateside trip was &quot;not permanent.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We think that Derick has great intentions, and is doing so much good. Let&#8217;s make that clear and not take away from it for a second.</p>
<p>We just think that perhaps he should take into consideration his wife&#8217;s feelings &#8211; and nerves &#8211; a little more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give it a break for a little while, you know, Der?</p>
<p>Focus on the family before healing the world.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>We don&#8217;t have much to compare it to, but Ariel Winter dressed up in what has to be the trashiest <em>Scarlet Letter</em> costume we&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And we <em>love</em> it.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Even old Nathaniel Hawthorne would be rolling over in his grave at the interpretation of his beloved Hester Prynne character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 18-year-old <em>Modern Family</em> star flaunted her dwindling assets in a tight-fit corset and bustier, and &#8230; not much else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow. Just &#8230; wow.</p>
<p>As you can see, Ariel&#8217;s looking much less voluptuous these days than she has in the recent past, which is a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>Even though <a href="/2016/02/ariel-winter-breast-reduction-surgery-changed-my-life/">Winter had a breast reduction surgery</a>, which she was very open about, her top was still pretty hefty afterward.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Fear not, though &#8211; if the actress is losing weight, which it appears that she is, not much is coming from her chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She shared another snap (above, for all her adoring fans), which featured an up-close shot of her gorgeous body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know you wanna.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, Winter <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a43247/ariel-winter-november-2016/">spoke out about online critics to <em>Seventeen</em></a>, and claimed what a mess &quot;fans&quot; had made of <a href="/2016/02/ariel-winter-proudly-displays-breast-reduction-scars-on-red-carp/">Ariel&#8217;s self-esteem</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said, &quot;It&rsquo;s definitely hard being self-conscious and having the world be able to tell you how they feel about you.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ariel Winter 2016 Emmy Awards Pose Pic" class="wp-image-240893" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-735x1103.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-223x335.jpg 223w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-231x347.jpg 231w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-347x520.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-427x640.jpg 427w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-512x768.jpg 512w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-640x960.jpg 640w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-720x1080.jpg 720w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ariel-winter-2016-emmy-awards-pose-pic-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>

<p>&quot;Before Twitter and Instagram,&quot; Ariel continued, &quot;if you felt a certain way about a person you didn&rsquo;t know, you couldn&rsquo;t tell them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#8217;Now I wake up and I have tweets to me about how I&rsquo;m a fat, ugly blah-blah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I was younger, it took a lot more of a toll on me than it does now,&quot; she admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;My sister helped me understand that people will say those things regardless of how you look.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tell myself every day, &#8216;I look fabulous,&#8217;&quot; Ariel continued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for good reason!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&quot;I definitely have pushed myself to deal with the good and the bad because I feel there are so many girls who need to hear positivity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like as many of us women who can band together and discuss things in a positive way will be so beneficial,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Losing one person in that discussion wouldn&rsquo;t be helpful.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, <a href="/2016/09/ariel-winter-gives-shoutout-to-haters-i-love-my-bullies/">Ariel even hit out at bullies</a> in a September 2016 post which she shared online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said, &quot;Every time someone bullies me online, it gives me a chance to re-emphasize to my and even myself, how important self-acceptance is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those who say such harsh things on my Instagram, thank you for this opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The question I ask myself each time I read the mean comments is if this is how you talk to a stranger online, I can only imagine how cruelly you speak to yourself.&quot;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>In conclusion, the outspoken star &#8211; who also dressed up like a <em>Playboy</em> bunny this weekend, because of course she did, and why shouldn&#8217;t she &#8211; added that she &quot;loves&quot; her bullies as well as her supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my fans and I love my bullies for what they truly need is love.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take the high road,&quot; she wrote. &quot;There is less traffic.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking good, girl &#8211; and whatever you do, don&#8217;t ever change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a bit, not an inch, not an idea.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 3</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>We&#8217;re not quite sure what Lindsay is for Halloween, except for <em>Hot</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lindsay <a href="/2015/07/lindsay-lohan-posts-naked-butt-selfie-to-celebrate-birthday/">Lohan stripped down</a> to her bright pink lingerie, and captioned the photo, &quot;#halloweencostume #halloweenisaworkout#halloween #everydaywewearpink and no filter.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While another possibility of <a href="/2015/10/lindsay-lohan-rocks-fake-engagement-ring-at-halloween-party-cont/">Lindsay&#8217;s costume could be &quot;drunk&quot;</a> &#8211; what even are those hashtags? &quot;Halloween is a workout?&quot; &quot;Every day we wear pink and no filter?&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>What does it all even <em>mean?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Later she shared another snap, this one much more demure, and featured friends with some of the biggest lips you&#8217;ve ever seen in your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She&#8217;d apparently changed her mind about the costume, and said, &ldquo;Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t spend tonight with my beautiful friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off to bed before early flight to Turkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrong, ah, holiday, girl, but okay. Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This snap, she captioned, &quot;Left too soon.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>We aren&#8217;t exactly fluent in Lindsay language (who is), but perhaps there&#8217;s someone out there who can decipher her nonsensical ramblings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her captions are always okay, but when it comes to her hashtagging, stuff just seems to fall apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She might be embarrassing herself mildly on social media &#8211; though there&#8217;s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of over that body, dang &#8211; but it&#8217;s not nearly as bad as what happened earlier this month.</p>
<p>You all remember what went down at the newly-opened, hilariously-named night club, <em>Lohan, </em>right?</p>
<p>During the fete, <a href="/2016/10/lindsay-lohan-in-full-meltdown-mode-at-lohan-night-club/">Lindsay had an epic night club meltdown</a>, where she told off the patrons of her namesake club.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/lindsay-lohan-tells-nightclub-crowd-to-shut-the-f-k-up"></a></figure>
<p>Trying to get the crowd&#8217;s attention, she said, &quot;[I have to say] a really important thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just want everyone to &#8230;&quot; she trailed off.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut the f&#8211;k up!&quot; Lindsay shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;No, seriously, please,&quot; she begged.</p>
<p>&quot;Just stop talking and listen for a second.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not going to speak until you stop,&quot; she whined, pleading her case, even as everyone but her realized her plea fell upon deaf ears.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the audience did not heed her warning and kept right on doing their thing, and Lohan ended up looking pretty foolish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So embarrassing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But hey.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>If the above &quot;Halloween&quot; snap is progress for progress&#8217; sake, we&#8217;ll take it every day of the week and twice on Sundays.</p>
<p>After all, it seems like she&#8217;s severed ties with her abusive ex, Egor Tarabasov, and for that, we can be eternally thankful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, and switching gears &#8230; can we get the real deal on what&#8217;s happening with Lindsay Lohan for Halloween?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s the big day &#8230; after a month of preparation, she must have some idea of what she&#8217;s talking about, right? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on, girl. We&#8217;re begging you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let us down, okay?&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Can you guess what Kim Kardashian dressed up as a few years ago?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim Kardashian dressed up as desperation, ass-kissing, and awkwardness all in one costume.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kim&#8217;s <a href="/2015/05/kris-jenner-to-trademark-word-momager/">Momager, Kris Jenner</a>, shared the throwback pic on her Instagram page, and captioned it:</p>
<p>&quot;That Halloween when @kimkardashian was #annawintour, #northwest was @andreltalley #andreleontalley, @joycebonelli was @therealgracecoddington, and #zeplin was @karllagerfeld #favorite #flashback #halloween #love.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jenner&nbsp;needs to get the memo that yes, there is a thing known as too much hashtagging. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The snap was a bit older &#8211; though North West wasn&#8217;t too young, so it mustn&#8217;t have been too far into the past &#8211; but as you know, <a href="/2015/05/kim-kardashian-snubbed-by-vogue-in-favor-of-kenndall-jenner/">Kim&#8217;s long had an obsession with Anna Wintour</a> and <em>Vogue&nbsp;</em>at large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cripes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Oh, girl, we can&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t, ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent Kim news, it was reported that <a href="/2016/10/kim-kardashian-goodbye-hollywood/">Kardashian is leaving Los Angeles</a>, which could be a song, so maybe Robin Thicke&nbsp;can come on in and pilfer the idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come, Thicke, come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A source revealed that Kim&#8217;s fed up with Hollywood, and is considering a big move to Orange County.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="760" height="473" src="http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian Ring Pic" class="wp-image-244580" srcset="https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic.jpg 760w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic-300x187.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic-735x457.jpg 735w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic-335x208.jpg 335w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic-347x216.jpg 347w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic-520x324.jpg 520w, https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/10/kim-kardashian-ring-pic-640x398.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px" /><figcaption>(CBS)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Without her ring, of course, so that&#8217;ll at least lessen the packing load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The insider revealed, &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;s been complaining that L.A. is full of &#8216;crazies&#8217; and the only way she&#8217;ll be able to keep her family safe is to leave the city and keep a low profile.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her friends who live there boast about the safety and low crime rates, and the shopping is incredible.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, let&#8217;s buy more stuff so we can be robbed again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s trying to walk around with a big, old target on her back.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Get some sense, girl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while you&#8217;re at it, why not convince your family to get their heads out of Anna Wintour&#8217;s poor ass?&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that cohabitating and kissing of her bottom&#8217;s got to chafe, you know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And between them and the perpetual stick that&#8217;s up there, it&#8217;s got to be a rough ride for poor Anna Wintour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wonder who she&#8217;s gonna be for Halloween.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Psych &#8211; Anna Wintour&nbsp;would <em>never</em> be anybody but Anna Wintour for anything, but especially something as d&eacute;class&eacute;&nbsp;as Halloween.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thought you knew, sheesh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out the simply distressing video:&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/videos/kylie-jenner-dresses-up-as-dirrty-christina-aguilera-for-hallowe"></a></figure>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;didn&#8217;t clear your palate for the rest of the day, the full body shots probably will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kylie&#8217;s straggly-looking hyper-blonde extensions were definitely put to good use, and we did get to see a lot of her banging,&nbsp;possibly-surgicially-enhanced&nbsp;body, but &#8230;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think that was bad?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well hold onto your own asses, because things just got&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;awful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following &#8211; disturbing &#8211; footage also proved that&nbsp;<a href="/2014/06/kendall-jenner-shows-off-horrific-dance-moves-in-givenchy-ad/">this&nbsp;Jenner&nbsp;girl just cannot dance</a>&nbsp;either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guess we can&#8217;t have all of the things all of the time, huh?&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image placeholder-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="/videos/kylie-jenner-as-dirrty-christina-aguilera-for-halloween-dances-p"></a></figure></div>
<p>Cringing so hard yet?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are, but not any more than the whole entire internet at once, because man, that is a lot of cringing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She pulled the look off &quot;well,&quot; and if by &quot;well,&quot; we mean she was only slightly less greasy-looking than&nbsp;Xtina&#8217;s&nbsp;original look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure></p>
<p>Are you sorry you ate yet today?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, though &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="/2016/03/kylie-jenner-and-tyga-see-their-steamy-snapchat-stills/">boyfriend&nbsp;Tyga&nbsp;was there</a>&nbsp;to protect Kylie&#8217;s modesty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another snap, Kylie was shown covering up her ample ass with a jacket, while&nbsp;Tyga&nbsp;protectively held his arm around her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t love just grand?&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kylie&#8217;s been all about showing off her body lately &#8211; as per the norm &#8211; and in a recent video, she stripped down to nearly nothing and made &#8230; lasagna?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her&nbsp;Snapchat&nbsp;videos have only gotten more and more bizarre as the months have gone by, and it&#8217;s apparent that she&#8217;s seeking some pretty hardcore attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the snap, which featured some serious flesh-flashing and lasagna-making,&nbsp;<a href="/2016/10/kylie-jenner-strips-makes-lasagna-in-bizarre-snapchat-story/">Kylie&#8217;s ass looked much bigger</a>&nbsp;that it did in her Halloween costume.</p>
<p>That? Well, it lent even more credence to the rumors that Kylie&#8217;s got some kind of manual pump in her front pocket that blows that ass up to magical proportions.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Honestly, what even&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why do we have to be subjected to such mysterious things on a regular basis?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know it&#8217;s Halloween, and all the things are rife with scariness and ghouls and&nbsp;gobins&nbsp;and whatever else, but we never thought we&#8217;d be so afraid of a backside like we are of Kylie&#8217;s ass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good God, may the saints or whoever else preserve &#8230; our sanity.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="span-reading-time rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time"> 2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span><p>Another day, another photo featuring Khloe Kardashian looking virtually unrecognizable, and thusly, like a half-melted wax mannequin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even sister Kourtney looks super tweaked in this photo &#8230; and if the duo hasn&#8217;t gotten (more) plastic surgery, then they really need to fire whoever the hell is digitally editing their photos.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Kourtney shared the snap on her Instagram page last night, and captioned it, &quot;Last week with my boo,&quot; which we&#8217;re gonna take to mean that this is, sadly, a fairly recent pic of the sisters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, though &#8211; ha, as if we&#8217;re mincing words today &#8211; the two look <em>terrible</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though some comments on the pic&nbsp;read &quot;Please <a href="/2015/08/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery-intervention-staged-by-family/">stop getting plastic surgery</a>,&quot; most of the others centered around Photoshopping accusations.</p>
<p>Truth be told, though, only either a <em>really</em> gifted &#8211; or a really <em>ham-fisted</em> &#8211; digital artist could manipulate their normally-gorgeous faces into something this appalling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is Halloween, though, so perhaps they&#8217;re going as the plastic versions of themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>&#8230; The <em>more</em> plastic versions of themselves, that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Khloe shared the above pic&nbsp;last week, and she caught a ton of flak for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you take a good look at the photo, you&#8217;ll see that Khloe&#8217;s looking more like Miley Kardashian than anything else, and the overall effect is not good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We like Miley&#8217;s face just fine, and there&#8217;s nothing bad about Khloe&#8217;s either, but when you combine the two?</p>
<p>Two words: toothy caveman.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>Previously, <a href="/2016/10/khloe-kardashian-did-she-get-massive-plastic-surgery/">Khloe spoke out about plastic surgery</a>, and said &quot;Let me set the record straight once and for all.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#8217;t had any fillers or done any plastic surgery.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet,&quot; she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet,&quot; indeed, we say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kourtney herself was even rumored to go under the knife in order to impress <a href="/2016/04/kourtney-kardashian-getting-plastic-surgery-to-hold-on-to-justin/">one-time fling, Justin Bieber</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
<p>When she was dating Justin, she was said to do it to &quot;hold onto&quot; him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;With all the models half her age that Justin has been with, Kourtney is feeling insecure,&quot; a source reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#8217;s been working super hard on her body and she looks amazing, but she feels like she could look much younger.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all that doesn&#8217;t just translate to stupidity for you, then you, friends, just might be a Kardashian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or Justin Bieber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which might be even worse.&nbsp;</p>
